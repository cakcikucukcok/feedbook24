  <title>It All Comes Down to “W.E.!” - Linda Westcott-Bernstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Find out how W.E. (work ethic) can build new strength in your life!
I chose It all comes down to W.E. as the title for this book because I believe that the very essence of  work ethic stems from the idea that many individuals influence our life each and every day.  Our daily interactions may consist of positive encounters or they may include negative ones, but regardless of the type, they will have made an impression upon us from which we will learn.  It is how we apply what we have learned during those interactions that will ultimately determine the individual that we become.
Key Components of Work Ethic
This book will provide you with a template for building your own work ethic, one that will forever change the way that you see yourself, pursue your goals, and even do business. 
A solid work ethic consists of many essential components coming together to mold our character.  
	Focus on the job at hand.
	Dont give up or quit.
	Share and bear the load
	Finish the job  completely.
	Take pride in a job well done.
Good work habits begin with strong foundations; values, standards, morals, and guidance.  A solid family foundation is the starting place where most good work habits manifest.  However, family does not have to be strictly genetic.  Some of the finest and most successful companies have created a family work environment that is encouraging, friendly and growth-oriented, and they have done so by incorporating good values, solid work ethics and effective leadership.  
You have power over your future, so take control of your life and become accountable for your future." />
