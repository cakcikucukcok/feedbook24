  <title>A Little Piece of Me - Stephen A. Geller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Verdana&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;; color: black; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;At the prime of her life, accomplished pianist Marcia Kleinman is forced to make some heart-wrenching decisions. She has a difficult husband, a difficult mother and her little boy, Max, has been diagnosed with a rare liver disease that will likely require a liver transplant. As Maxs health declines, Marcia is faced with challenges testing her spirit, her resolve and her sense of self. Will she donate a portion of her own liver to Max? Will her husband, Michael, support her efforts to save their sons life or will his controlling instincts and fears get in the way? Will Barbara, her mother, be sympathetic and supportive or, as usual, critical? Marcia increasingly finds solace at her piano, searching for the ever-elusive heart of Beethovens Appassionata. Her music is her salvation as she rediscovers her strength and passion dealing with life-changing, and life-saving, decisions while her marriage crumbles and her son gets sicker and sicker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
