  <title>Stay Calm and Content - Cat Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you sometimes stressed, anxious, or emotional? 
Do you ever feel something is missing even when you think you should be happy? 
Are there people with whom you dont get on well but wish you did? 
Have you ever wondered why you behave a certain way, do or dont do certain things, or have done something you now regret? 
This is not a typical self-help book because self-help books are usually read by people who think they have a problem to solve. This book is for everyone. Using straightforward, jargon-free language, it discusses many of the difficult issues of life, most of which are likely to affect us or someone we know at one time or another. It includes short discussions of stress, relationships, love affairs, work, parenting, sibling rivalry, motherhood, divorce, weddings, Christmas, teenagers, arguments, criticism, depression, communication, childhood, bullying, chronic pain, self-harm, addiction, suicide, bereavement, kindness, abuse, the battle of the sexes, and more. 
People who can stay calm and content no matter what life throws at them all have similar thoughts and attributes that can be learned by anyone. The central theme of this book is self-esteem and how it is affected every day by our circumstances and the people we come across. We are usually unaware that it is our self-esteem that drives our emotions, thoughts, and actions. 
The authors clients suggested this book be written so anyone could learn how to stay calm and content no matter what life throws at them. Personal stories highlight how you can control or change how you feel about yourself and how you can positively influence your life and the lives of everyone around you." />
