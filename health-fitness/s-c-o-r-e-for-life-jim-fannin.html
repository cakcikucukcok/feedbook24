  <title>S.C.O.R.E. for Life - Jim Fannin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever choked during a performance?&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been told how much talent you have, yet you&amp;#39;re not reaching it?&lt;br /&gt;Are you self-conscious or doubtful during performances?&lt;br /&gt;Does your level of concentration fluctuate wildly?&lt;br /&gt;Do you feel overwhelmed at times?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all dream of overcoming our challenges. We dream of the perfect job, achieving new wealth, of living the life we choose in harmony with the people we love. For many of us, the dream stops there. We wonder what leads some extraordinary people to confront and exceed their goals and compete at the highest level, while others run in place, distracted by fears and a sense of intimidation. We seek the insights that will liberate us from anxiety and self-doubt. In this book, Jim Fannin shares a collection of ideas and daily exercises that transform everyday performers into true champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the secrets of Fannin&amp;#39;s time-tested S.C.O.R.E. System (Self-Discipline, Concentration, Optimism, Relaxation, and Enjoyment), &lt;em&gt;S.C.O.R.E. for Life&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to balance and apply these five principles in every arena of life. The result: more moments, days, and years performing and thinking in the state of flow we call the &amp;#34;Zone,&amp;#34; and more of the results and success that matter. Every chapter includes reader-friendly tests and exercises, like the &amp;#34;90-Second Rule&amp;#34; (a lesson in discipline) and &amp;#34;The Palm Tree Versus the Oak Tree&amp;#34; (a lesson in adaptability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than thirty years, Jim Fannin has coached hundreds of top-performing athletes and business leaders, who testify to what the S.C.O.R.E. System can do. It is a tried and proven blueprint for realizing our extraordinary human potential and overcoming the fears and worries that hold us back. With commitment and consistent use of this success formula, you will blaze new paths to personal and professional achievement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
