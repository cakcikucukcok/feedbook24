This book deals with several subjects that are pertinent to young people, and older ones, too, on issues of personal responsibility to oneself, to one’s family and to one’s country. Some of the important subjects covered include youth responsibility for personal and on-the-job safety, mental health care and promotion of mental wellness, healing of racism, and acceptance of difference. This book also shows how welcoming responsibilities equips one to develop the disposition that facilitates making the right decisions when faced with dilemmas." />
