      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living FULL—Conquering the eating disorder monster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memoir of an anorexic:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is my journey from starving to letting myself become FULL–physically &amp;amp; emotionally. What is living a FULL life exactly? Having anorexia, bulimia, or vacillating between the two, you are emptying yourself or trying to achieve an empty feeling through starvation or purging. Living a FULL life is a life where you aren’t starving anymore—starving for acceptance and love from others and yourself. It’s a life where you are feeding your mind and soul with good thoughts and foods. It’s a life without your eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victim of the eating disorder monster:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Imagine waking in a hospital bed to find your frail, pale arm punctured by an IV transferring fluids and nutrients into your weak, stiff body. What happened? You’re an adult, age twenty-six, seventy-six pounds, and you just had a seizure precipitated by your chronic secretive decades-long struggle with unacknowledged eating disorders (ED). You have no friends and no normal young-adult experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Living FULL&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is author Danielle Sherman-Lazar&#39;s story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden out of shame:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Eating disorders in young adults are hardly talked about although they are extremely pervasive. Eating disorders are kept hidden out of shame. A groundbreaking 2012 study published in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Eating Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;found that about 13 percent of women over age 50 exhibit ED symptoms. To put that in perspective: Breast cancer afflicts about 12 percent of women. Everyone knows about breast cancer and how dangerous it is; yet eating disorders are kept hidden out of shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journey to recovery:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Filled with pop culture references that will appeal to millennials, humor, and delivered with raw honesty about the escalating and increasingly dangerous behaviors of a person acting out the mental illness of ED,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Living FULL&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chronicles author Danielle Sherman-Lazar&#39;s step-by-step descent into the nightmare that is full-blown ED. Recovery comes using the Maudsley Approach, a treatment that is rarely tried on adults. In a grueling battle, sometimes reminiscent of Helen Keller’s fight with Anne Sullivan, the Maudsley Approach is a regimen of supervised controlled eating or refeeding by out-patient helpers that eventually can result in recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memoir of an Anorexic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;exposes the rarely talked about behind-the-scene triggers and treatments, shame and guilt, and even coexisting addictions that go undetected in adult women today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Living FULL&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is written by a woman who has passed through the crucible of ED to recovery. Danielle Sherman-Lazar shares the most intimate and shameful details of her mental illness. She is now a mother with a fierce commitment to raise a healthy daughter who may well carry the ED gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of reading&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Living FULL: Memoir of an Anorexic:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn how to confront your ED demon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find relief from someone who has won her ED battle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discover a new and beautiful life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
