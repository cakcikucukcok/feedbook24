  <title>Stupid Guy in the Midwest - Guy RightZ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Stupid Guy in the Midwest&lt;/i&gt; is to help non-custodial fathers understand what they might go through should a divorce or an end of a relationship becomes nasty. As well as the after effects of dealing with the court system and an uncooperative ex-partner pertaining to child custody/visitation and child support.&lt;p&gt;
I have found many fathers in similar situations with no reference or guidelines of what to expect. I have provided my experiences in this book, which includes my mistakes, successes and check lists to help fathers and stepmoms that become knee deep in the dysfunctionality of the court system. The court system and
child services insist that what they care about is simply the welfare of the children yet the system ends up creating parental alienation in the process.&lt;p&gt;
Most men are unaware that theres a Fathers Rights movement. Fathers are torn away from their children causing a feeling of loss and desolation, not knowing what to expect next. Frustration gets the better of them, which is where extra mistakes begin to happen. They fall into a state of denial.&lt;p&gt;
This book will help guide them with my helpful hints and mistakes as they go down the journey and understanding that when there are children involved, divorce doesnt really mean its the end, but will certainly help them achieve a little leverage in the process." />
