  <title>Dog-Kissed Tears: Songs of Friendship, Loss, and Healing - Lambert Zuidervaart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 4:00 a.m. the day after Rosa died. I am wide-awake from a brief and troubled sleep.  This book explores the loss of a dear friend and companion-a remarkable fifteen-year-old retriever named Rosa.   Many people form deep attachments to their pets. Yet we wonder how to celebrate our friendships with them and how to grieve their death. Dog-Kissed Tears is a meditative memoir woven from life with Rosa. In stories that are funny, sad, moving, and honest, Lambert Zuidervaart links his attachment to his beloved dog and his love for human friends. Familiar songs help him trace his personal journey through the adoption, life, and death of a canine companion. As Lambert works through grief and longing for Rosa, he connects memories of childhood with self-discoveries in middle age.   Dog-Kissed Tears weaves a lyrical narrative of friendship, loss, and healing. Its spiritual undercurrent is subtle but profound." />
