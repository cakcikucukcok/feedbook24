  <title>The Hills - P.A. Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Hills is a true story experienced and told to me over the years by my
mother, Beth. This story about my mothers childhood began in Lepanto,
Arkansas and ended in Concrete, Washington. There was a lot of pathos,
happiness, and learning about life that we dont see in our families today. Mothers
fi rst seven years were spent in a little 2 bedroom house in Arkansas where she
learned family values. The second part of her journey in growing up was three
weeks spent in a Model A crossing the United States in a move to improve the
quality of their lives. Upon arrival in Concrete, Washington, her family settled
into a situation where they had a much nicer lifestyle for a time. It is a true story
of how families were making it in the Big Depression." />
