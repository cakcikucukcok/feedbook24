  <title>Life’S Too Short to Date Men Like Me - Willie Booker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every woman has either dated a jerk, or knows a friend that has dated one. But avoiding the jerks and attracting a decent man is actually a lot easier than you think.  
Forget watching reruns of &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/i&gt; or chatting with your girlfriends late at night. In this guidebook, a self-professed jerk comes straight out, speaks the truth, and systematically explains how to 
	spot, avoid, and say goodbye to jerks;
	tell if a guy is wasting your time;
	deal with players
	hunt for &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; men (and where to hunt for them).
Youll also learn how to avoid common mistakes, such as overrating initial chemistry, inadvertently hurting a mans ego, losing a good guys interest and much more. 
Full of witty satire and sarcasm. Get ready to laugh out loud with this hilarious &lt;i&gt;anti-game.&lt;/i&gt;
What people had to say about this book:
Hey Willie, this is so entertaining! Ha ha you have a great sense of humor, and your statements are so true! - Denise
We all know no one likes a tattletale. Hate the game, not the player. Every girl Tiger slept with knew he was married. Who is worse? - Steve the player
That was such an enjoyable and enlightening read. I mean its well written, witty, and one would think some of it is common sense, but sometimes people (i.e. me!) need common sense to slap them in the face! - Cheryl
Willie whistle blower has a nice ring to it. You know someones going to kick your butt one day? Good work!  A guy Willie no longer parties with
I dont understand you. You go through university, build a promising career. Now you quit your job and write this book? Why would you tell the whole world youre an asshole?  Willies mom" />
