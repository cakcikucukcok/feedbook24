  <title>Awakening the Fire Within - Lyse Lebeau, Duart Maclean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book integrates psychological, spiritual and pragmatic approaches to the mastery of life. It focuses on relationship, leadership and self-esteem. We know that what motivates our thoughts, feelings, words and actions is less than 10% at the level of the conscious mind. The driving forces in our lives do not exist at the surface of our minds, where we make our every day, &#39;conscious&#39; decisions.  What truly moves us lies buried deep within and we must become familiar with that shadowy underworld from where our real choices and actions are being motivated.
In order to get into our personal &#39;underworld&#39;, where the real work must be done, we must go far beyond intellectualism, positive thinking, and &#39;re-programming&#39;.  We have found that the practices of yoga, ranging from breathwork and postures to meditation and self-enquiry, are the most effective means of diving deep within the unconscious.  As we follow the paths of yoga to the depths of the ocean of our own existence, we inevitably encounter the many shadowy forms of the unconscious lurking below the surface.  It is by encountering, embracing and then releasing these submerged thought-forms and undigested feelings and sensations, that we will ultimately attain our &#39;pearl of great price&#39;, Self-realization.
This book emphasizes the use of the breath as a potent means for exploring and clearing the unconscious.  When integrated with an ability to recognize and understand how our negative, self-defeating &#39;patterns&#39; operate, progress can be remarkably rapid and enduring.
Finally, particular attention is given to the use of &#39;action&#39; as a means to self-knowledge, self-healing and self-transformation.  It is in the heat of action that we actually discover how we are put together and identify where we are weak and where we are strong. Breaking through our resignation and stepping out onto the playing field of life is accomplished in the field of action, where leadership resides." />
