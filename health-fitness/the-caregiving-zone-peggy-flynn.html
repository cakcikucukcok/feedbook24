  <title>The Caregiving Zone - Peggy Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot; a unique opportunity to learn about caregiving from a true veteran and practitioner of the art.&quot;-Jon D. Kaiser, M.D., Physician and Author of &lt;I&gt;Healing HIV&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coping with illness and dying is a challenge. How do we allocate resources? What are the rights and responsibilities of the sick and those tending them? Can the burdens of caregiving be blessings in disguise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Caregiving Zone&lt;/I&gt;, Peggy Flynn, founder and director of The Good Death Institute, describes the everyday challenges of caregiving. She encourages us to think about illness and death as incontrovertible realities that can be anticipated and made less burdensome for everyone involved. &quot;Death is hard, but it doesn&#39;t have to be hideous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using personal stories and reflections, Ms. Flynn illuminates life &quot;in the Zone&quot; with understanding and empathy. She suggests that individuals and families &quot;take charge of the inevitable&quot; by confronting their fears and preparing for illness and death before events overtake them. She envisions &quot;a program designed for families or groups of friends who want to be proactive about the inevitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Caregiving Zone&lt;/I&gt; illustrates how both giving and receiving care can provide opportunities and rewards in addition to burdens. Sometimes, with insight, information and compassion, the benefits can outweigh the costs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
