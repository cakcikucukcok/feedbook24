  <title>Ashkettle Crazy - A. M. Goetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, Conservation Officer Everett Ashkettle became the victim of a hushed mountain murder. That&amp;rsquo;s when Crazy Uncle Merle moved in, and life for Everett&amp;rsquo;s three young sons went from unconventional to unbearable. Merle brought with him an iron fist that too often fell on the youngest boy&amp;rsquo;s head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with nowhere to go and few people who care, Sonny, Bo and Dack have learned to rely only on each other. They plan to leave once Dack is old enough to quit school, but those plans change when Bo arrives home early from work one November night and finds his kid brother beaten, bloodied and next on Merle&amp;rsquo;s list to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desperate to save them both, Bo takes the boy and makes an impulsive run for the wilds of the Adirondack Mountains with only one paycheck in his pocket and a vague memory of his father&amp;rsquo;s old hunting cabin on his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey will be long and treacherous, the woods unforgiving. But if they make it, they&amp;rsquo;ll be reunited with older brother Sonny and have a shot at a normal life lived out along the banks of the Boquet River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dack has secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Merle is determined the boy will never live to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the book that launched the moving Ashkettle Boys Book Series today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
