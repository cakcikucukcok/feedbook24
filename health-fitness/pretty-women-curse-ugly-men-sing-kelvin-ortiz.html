  <title>Pretty Women Curse, Ugly Men Sing - Kelvin Ortiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wanna live there one day&amp;quot;, Enosh says from his grandfather&amp;#39;s backseat, looking out at a city skyline. Pulled out to sea by impossible towers&amp;nbsp;of countless lights, only to have his grandfather wrinkle&amp;nbsp;his nose at the sight, and forbid him from ever going to that impossible city in the distance. He warns his&amp;nbsp;grandson that the world&amp;nbsp;has a way of changing people, in ways&amp;nbsp;that they never see&amp;mdash;especially there because that is a land of lost sheep and salesman. Where you either think you know where you&amp;#39;re going, or you&amp;#39;re fooling someone else into that delusion for a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enosh runs away from home with his Uncle after the death of his grandfather. He holds the same&amp;nbsp;aspirations of being&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt;. What he doesn&amp;#39;t know, is that his father had left him with his grandparents. Told his whole life that his parents had died in a car crash, he runs away from home with the father that&amp;#39;d left him at birth.&amp;nbsp;This novel is about making the best of bad situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through powerful symbolism and moving poetry, this story is bound to pull at your heartstrings with it&amp;#39;s cast of fleshed out and complexly-crafted characters, all trying their best to wait out the nights of their lives, and see morning. If it ever comes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
