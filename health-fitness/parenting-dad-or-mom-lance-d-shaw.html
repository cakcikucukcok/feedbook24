  <title>Parenting Dad (&amp;/Or Mom) - Lance D. Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I asked for and gained initial physical custody when my marriage ended in late 1981.  The kids (Kim-age 3 , Lance-nearly age 5) and I  invented a series of creative growth games which helped us focus on our values, philosophies, and have fun all the while overcoming challenges in a complex world of tremendous change.  Every day started and ended with joy and thanksgiving.  I wouldnt trade it for anything!   For over 20 years, I have shared the fun, laughs, possible benefits &amp; results of our lessons and techniques with audiences.  
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have shared the essence of my parenting lessons, which I adapted from my professional managerial and technical experiences, as an adjunct faculty member of the University of Phoenix (Sacramento Valley Campus System) where I was twice awarded the distinction as Outstanding Faculty in Business Administration. 
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have conducted management training sessions for GE, where I was recognized as earning the highest instructor evaluation in a 3-year period.  I recently conducted training for physician chiefs at a large hospital.  I shared a game invented by daughter Kim at age 6  (the Wishing Well Game) with over 100 dads and their kids at the Second Annual Fathers Spring Festival at Las Lomitas School, Atherton, California.  
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have contributed in several industries (mostly high technology) from very large Fortune 500sGE (3 Divisions), FMC (2 Divisions), IBM, Motorola, Applied Materials, and Tandem Computers (which is now part of HP).  I have earned degrees: BS Electrical Engineering, and Masters of Business Administration. &lt;A href= &quot;http://Lance@parentingdad.com&quot;&gt;Lance@parentingdad.com&lt;/A&gt;" />
