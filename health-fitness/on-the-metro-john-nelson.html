  <title>On the Metro: - John Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every day we see the mundane, the same old same old. But, if you look closely enough there is a lot going on. A lot of good things. If we stop for a moment, and think, we will see that the world is not so gray and hopeless. It is not routine. It isnt even boring. If we stop and think of the wonders around us, there is something there. Something that Got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I began writing the 420 character (or less) thoughts on Facebook statuses so that I could pass some time as I moved from point A to point B, and perhaps back again. But somewhere along the line, people began to respond to the thoughts. Folks grew passionate about getting up, having coffee, and reading the metro musings. It became something to pass on through Facebook, or email.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The purpose was to simply write down some positive thoughts while in the most negative, barren part of my day. It was a way to find beauty in a gray world, seemingly filled with hatred, death, famine and any other horrid things that come to your mind. This book, for the lack of a better term, is just thoughts that you or I could have while riding on a train.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is just something, anything, nothing, which, for the lack of a better term, got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;" />
