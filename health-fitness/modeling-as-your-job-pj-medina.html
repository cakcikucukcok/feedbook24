But unlike you in those days the early 1980s there were no books on the subject of becoming a Model or very few. So after having doors slammed in my face and losing money on useless schools, pictures and three years of my life trying to make a career I gave up my dream of ever becoming a Model. However through mi trials I have learned a great deal.
One day a friend who was starting his own career as a Model asked, How do I go about landing an agent? So I told him what little I remembered. It turned out that the little.
I knew was a lot of information. He turned to me and said, Why if you know so much wont you manage my career?

So I began a quest researching books, talking with people in the business and interviewing fashion designers to understand what they are looking for in a Model This book was born Modeling As Your Job A step-by-step guild on how you can become a working Model." />
