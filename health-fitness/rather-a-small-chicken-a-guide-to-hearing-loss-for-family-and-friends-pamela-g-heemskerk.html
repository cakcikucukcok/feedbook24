  <title>Rather a Small Chicken...: A guide to hearing loss for family and friends - Pamela  G Heemskerk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With 1 in 6 Australians diagnosed with a hearing impairment, and many more interacting daily with someone who is hearing impaired, the chances of miscommunication are high. Such problematic communication impacts on relationships at home and in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hearing aid companies supply simple &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; brochures for new hearing aid wearers. I have added a greater depth of information in my booklet to explain the &amp;lsquo;whys&amp;rsquo; behind the &amp;lsquo;how-tos&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash; Why does sound change with hearing loss? Why does it take time to learn to use hearing aids? Why can I hear some things perfectly and not others?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With 30 years of hearing impairment, Pamela Heemskerk has collated information from her own and others&amp;rsquo; experience and compiled a booklet covering the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;an explanation of how hearing loss impacts how we hear sounds&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;the difficulties of hearing loss and some self-help options&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;adjusting to hearing aids and how to get the best from them (in the ear, not in the box!)&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;how families/friends can assist those with hearing impairment&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;tips&amp;nbsp;to reduce the frustration experienced in communication difficulties&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;information for health professionals and those who work with people with&amp;nbsp;hearing loss&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Safe-guarding against some of the ear problems that can arise from wearing hearing aids&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a short practical booklet for those who want to know more about living with hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
