  <title>The Late Talker - Dr. Marilyn C. Agin, Lisa F. Geng, Malcolm Nicholl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every parent eagerly awaits the day his or her child will speak for the first time. For millions of mothers and fathers, however, anticipation turns to anxiety when those initial, all-important words are a long time coming. Many worried parents are reassured that their child is &quot;just a late talker,&quot; but unfortunately, all too often that is not the case. Nineteen million children in the United States have serious speech disorders, such as apraxia of speech. For these toddlers, early and intensive speech therapy is crucial if they are to stand a chance of ever speaking normally. This book was written to help the worried parent cut through the confusion and stress to determine if their child needs help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Late Talker&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of its kind, providing effective, practical answers to the questions every concerned parent asks. Written by Marilyn C. Agin, a highly respected developmental pediatrician, and Lisa F. Geng, a mother of two late talkers, it is a tremendously useful handbook that includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Ways to identify the warning signs of a speech disorder&lt;br&gt;- Information on how to get the right kind of evaluations and therapy&lt;br&gt;- Ways to obtain appropriate services through the school system and health insurance &lt;br&gt;- Fun at-home activities that parents can do with their child to stimulate speech&lt;br&gt;- Groundbreaking evidence of the promising and dramatic benefits of nutritional supplementation&lt;br&gt;- Advice from experienced parents who&#39;ve been there on what to expect and what you can do to be your child&#39;s best advocate&lt;/p&gt;" />
