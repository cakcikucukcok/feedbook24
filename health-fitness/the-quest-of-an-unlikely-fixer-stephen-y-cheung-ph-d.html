  <title>The Quest of an Unlikely Fixer - Stephen Y. Cheung Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The goal of the book is to solve the three big problems plaguing our world: poverty, war, and environment deterioration from pollutions. The big three, besides making lives unbearable for billions, also have increasingly threatened to destroy us. Many, including the wisest and the most learned the human race has to offer, have tried and only to fail. The reason is simple: they just dont know what the reasons behind the problems are. 
This book, The Quest of an Unlikely Fixer, has through biophysics, clearly identified that the selfish nature of living organisms is the only reason. Selfishness always leads to hurtful behaviors; that is one of the reasons. The other reason is our godlike power. But we sadly dont have the right morality to guide this power. 
The solution to human selfishness and our godlike power is by a correct, new golden-rule-based morality, which allows us to come up with two moral principles to deal with selfishness. The book introduces moral selfishness as the tool to heal our sick planet. Following moral selfishness will promote intelligence and cooperation among the people of the world. It will bring a paradise to our planet. The book is full of original ideas." />
