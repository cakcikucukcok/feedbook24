      <meta name="description" content="Enjoy the very personal journey and passion with water from the healing point of view and personal experiences while coaching and motivating people. The journey is based on a fun perspective of flying a kite as the vehicle in life. You will enjoy and watch as the Author describes health success from over or above water, which brings a different way to draw parallels in life. Have a close encounter with daily health issues and menacing ones that may affect quality of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a hilarious and entertaining way the Author describes the health predators, from the gossiping of a medical office to surf health conditions in the net. Meet the pandemic creatures of health which stops people from evolution and transformation. Explore alternative ways to approach the body as water creatures and in a fun way create a love relationship with the self. Open the heart and just listen to the out loud liquid language of the body in the water, through positions, movement and quality of tissue. Experience the uncorking sensation of healing, even when it does not seem to be real. Embrace the liquid success in health easier and faster than imagination, when water is the catalyst to balance the energy which ignites our daily life success. Meet the health challenges of real testimonies of Latin Americans who getting deep in water have balance their brain to work on their benefit and not against them. Share the extraordinary success stories of the healing power of the liquid that brought us to life: water!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proposal of the Water Kite Journey is a simple invitation to get wet and heal. It is the journey of dedication and love transferred in the water to change the lives of people.
