  <title>A Grownup’S Guide to Living a Young-At-Heart Life - David Heller, Sally Melzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Grownups Guide to Living a Young-at-Heart Life is a whimsical and yet inspirational little book that aims to remind people of all ages of what it means to live in a free-spirited young-at-heart manner.  The instruction in this lovely book is provided by children, ages four to thirteen, who sound off on how to have a youthful disposition and enjoy life all the more.
Among the subjects the children address are the following: why children are the best experts on the subjects, how adults go astray and lose their way, vivid examples of young-at-heart behavior, and graphic examples of loathsome behaviors that are decidedly not young at heart. The youngsters even reveal a Top Ten List of Young-at-Heart Behaviors, offer adults remedial steps on improving themselves and loosening up, how the genders differ on this issue, and then wax philosophical on why and how so many adults forget the lessons of childhood.
The results in this collection are funny and heartwarming and will move the reader to reflect on how they themselves might benefit from adopting some of the childrens attitudes. We can all learn a bit from children, and this charming book provides a classic example as the youngsters share their wisdom on what it means to be young at heartwhether one is five or one hundred and five!" />
