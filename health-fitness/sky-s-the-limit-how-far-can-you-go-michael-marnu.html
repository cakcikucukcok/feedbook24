  <title>Sky’S the Limit. How Far Can You Go? - Michael Marnu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    I graduated from the University 1985, very positive and hopeful about the future. I looked to the world of possibilities and was very optimistic. In the
    course of time, I lost my job, came to the blackest depression of my life. I then learned this lesson in life. There is limit to skys the limit
    philosophy. In life, we battle against circumstances which are not mere fantasies but real, powerful enough to quench the fire in us. We all have a weak
    spot, our Achilles heel which makes us vulnerable and fatal especially if we are caught unawares. The limit we experience and our ability to overcome the
    limit determines the highest we can go. The decision to handle failure proactively and to deal with impossible situations is the key to the highest we can
    go.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The book addresses 15 secrets of life to help you to come out of mess and live the dreams of your life. To the reader this book wont just pose many
    questions but will give you some answers too. It will help you empower yourself by making the most of your God-given talents which many of us dont take
    advantage of. Take the best of what you read in this book, comprehend it, use it and make something out of your life
