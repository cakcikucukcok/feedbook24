  <title>Wise It Up - Michael Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are living in vulnerable days, as many of us find we are confronted with decaying levels of happiness, health, standard of living and peace of mind at the hands of our leaders and other authority figures. Now more than ever it is imperative to realize that your quality of life must be taken into your own hands, rather than relying on others to provide such intangibles. It is imperative to realize that those in power and claiming to act in your best interest are not always backing up their promises with appropriate actions. It is imperative to realize that Big Business, Big Pharma, Big Oil, and others motivated by money see dollar signs rather than loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise It Up is about helping you to live with greater happiness, health and fulfillment, in spite of deteriorating conditions that may surround you. Here you are provided with 365 nuggets of invaluable wisdom and advice to help you live well, live longer and live with greater passion and purpose. Nothing will improve in your life if you don&#39;t venture beyond where you are now - progress requires taking action. The alternative is to remain where you are, who you are and what your life currently is. If you continue to rely on others to get you where you want to go in life then you&#39;re doomed. It is time to take full responsibility for yourself and for your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin now to create positive change and take charge of your life, your happiness and your health to live fulfilled and with joy and passion. Learn more at www.WiseItUp.com&lt;/p&gt;" />
