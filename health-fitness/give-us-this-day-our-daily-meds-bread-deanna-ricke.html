  <title>Give Us This Day Our Daily Meds (Bread) - Deanna Ricke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Corporate executive Deanna Ricke discovered that the twenty-first century is a tough time to be a mom. From school shootings to pervasive porn, from children chained in basements to idolized addicts, the threats to her children were overwhelming, and fear of making the wrong decision nearly incapacitated her. She was no stranger to the debilitating effects of fear, however. In her work as a communications consultant, Deanna spent years helping corporate executives conquer their fear of public speaking. She knew that fear could be methodically, effectively managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I fought fear with faith, instead of narcotics? she thought. What if I turned to God instead of Google? Would that make me crazy or just Catholic? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An achingly honest and funny tale of how one worried working mom fought fear with faith and began hearing from God in wonderful ways. Deanna weaves together her own moving personal stories with Scripture, modern lyrics, and practical advice. She shares the seventeen steps she took to move from doubtful to devoutful. Each chapter begins with Scripture passages and ends with questions for consideration, making the book a great choice for individuals, book clubs, Bible studies, or small groups.&lt;/p&gt;" />
