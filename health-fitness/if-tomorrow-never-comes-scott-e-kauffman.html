  <title>If Tomorrow Never Comes - Scott E. Kauffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I would quit this job, travel to some exotic place, and I certainly would tell those closest to me just how important they are to me. Words like these are echoed by so many people each and every day, and with each day we have to decide what to do with the time we have left. Inside of each person is a destiny, a calling, a purpose, and yet we spend day after day either running from that calling, ignoring our passion, or otherwise just taking up space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Tomorrow Never Comes exposes the pit falls we experience in life, and brings answers to some of lifes most basic questions: Why am I here, and why now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a journey of discovery, and within each discovery is an answer that will lead you to a life full of adventure, a life full of peace and joy, and ultimately fulfillment as you discover the destiny that resides in you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
