  <title>Secrets to remain young - Andrea Busalacchi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here is the second work of an author who had considerable success with his book &amp;quot; How to have a perfect skin&amp;quot;. In this new effort are condensed his experiences, his knowledge in the pharmaceutical/ cosmetic/ nutritional field, especially his scientific research and his work experience. The author gives new unexpected meanings to nutritional supplements and cosmetic, which are considered a fundamental support for those want to live longer, healthier and with a healthy appearance. Even respecting the imposed limits - writing for a heterogeneous audience- the author is able to combine disclosure and scientific precision, as demonstrated by his specific citations and a wide bibliography. His overviews on different author&amp;rsquo;s methods and results are really exciting: see for example the amazing chapter on Method Maeda, a Japanese doctor who dedicated her entire life to the skin beauty and health, or the intense chapter by Dr. Massimo Buttinoni about &amp;ldquo;aesthetic medicine and wellness&amp;rdquo;. Andrea Busalacchi lists the most recent acquisitions about natural and not natural substances, whose action is scientifically documented and which can help us to delay the ageing process and maintain a more youthful appearance for a longer time. Ultimately, the secrets are a perfect synergy between nutrition, especially anti-inflammatory diet, supplements and cosmetics." />
