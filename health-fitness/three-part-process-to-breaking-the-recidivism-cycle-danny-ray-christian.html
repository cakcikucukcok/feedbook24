  <title>Three-Part Process to Breaking the Recidivism Cycle - Danny Ray Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The mere fact that you are holding this book in your hands is proof that being an addict and having an X on your back isnt a life sentence to failure. I was both an addict and prisoner for thirty years, yet today I live life as a clean, sober, and productive member of societyas a published writer and motivational speaker. I am living proof, and you can become proof also that a thing men did, a man may do again. I wrote this book because I saw everybody dedicating their time, effort, and money to try to solve every problem of society except answer the question What is going to get the brothers off the corner and keep them out of prison? Since I was once one of the brothers on the corner and in prison, I figured that it might help if I shared with those still on them and in prison how I broke the cycle of going in and out of rehab, prison, and the mental hospital. My experience has shown me that there is a way out of the revolving door of recidivism, but it requires work and commitment to change. There was a three-stage process to me ending my involvement in the penal system and addiction. It included (1) admitting the problem, (2) accepting responsibility for my role in it, and (3) surrendering to a higher power that could get me out of it. I believe this is a viable formula for anybody who wants to go from brokenness to wholeness. I encourage you to try it if you are tired of going around and around in the vicious cycle of addiction, prison, and purposelessness." />
