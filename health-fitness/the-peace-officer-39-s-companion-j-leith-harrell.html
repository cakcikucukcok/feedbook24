Inside youll find 365 inspirational passages from historys greats.  Each passage is accompanied by modern analysis from a street cops perspective.  Its nothing fancy, just frank observations honed over almost two decades of working the road.

Either way, youll enjoy the advice of some of the greatest minds and most accomplished people in history as you find you own answers to the jobs most pressing challenges." />
