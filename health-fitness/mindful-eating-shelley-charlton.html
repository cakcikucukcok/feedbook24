  <title>Mindful Eating - Shelley Charlton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you hear others preach, Everything in moderation, do you want to smack them in the face? If so, then this book is definitely for you.
Author Shelley Charlton is the kind of person who either wants all of the cake or none of the cake. She has accepted this fact about herself and has found a way to work around it without piling on the pounds. This brief guide does not ask you to change what youre eating and drinking but instead invites you to take a closer look at how and why youre eating and drinking. Here Charlton offers her thoughts, observations, and results from experimenting in the hope that you can learn to eat mindfully too. Obviously, Mindful Eating does not promise you the ultimate beach body in six weeks! However, it presents techniques to help you work with your body and mind so that you gradually feel better about yourself, lighter on your feet, and happier in your own skin.
Also by Shelley Charlton, YogaBounce: The Best of Both Worlds available at Amazon.com. For more information about Shelley please visit www.freeyogaonthebeach.com." />
