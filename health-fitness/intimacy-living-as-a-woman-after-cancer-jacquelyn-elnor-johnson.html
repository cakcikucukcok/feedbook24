  <title>Intimacy Living as a Woman After Cancer - Jacquelyn Elnor Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Becoming a Cancer Survivor and Women&amp;rsquo;s Relationships After Cancer &amp;ndash; Cancer and Resilience&lt;br /&gt;
Originally published in 1987, this new 2017 edition has been edited and expanded with new stories and information&lt;br /&gt;
Women tend to see life through a relationship lens &amp;ndash; we are our relationships, with ourselves and with everyone else in our lives. A diagnosis changes everything in your life, most immediately your sense of yourself and your relationships.&lt;br /&gt;
Who are you now, with cancer? And how can you be not a cancer &amp;ldquo;victim&amp;rdquo; but a cancer survivor?&lt;br /&gt;
Here, breast cancer survivor and journalist Jacquelyn Elnor Johnson tells the stories of women who are survivors, even as they grapple with the challenges cancer treatment and recovery presents while trying to come to terms with changed bodies and changed identities as women living with cancer.&lt;br /&gt;
Here are also findings of experts who offer insights into how we cope with, and overcome, the difficulties of this disease and keep living meaningful lives, despite cancer.&lt;br /&gt;
If you struggle to cope with cancer, wondering who you are now, as a woman with cancer trying to live her life as her normal self, and looking for support, help and hope, here is a book about becoming a survivor. It is also written for everyone who loves, lives with, works with, or cares for women with cancer and beyond cancer.&lt;br /&gt;
You can live fully as a woman with cancer and after cancer&amp;hellip;here are the stories of women like you who share their challenges and triumphs, including what they&amp;rsquo;ve found to be most helpful in reclaiming full, satisfying and even joyous lives, after cancer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
