  <title>My Waffle Dreams - Norman Rawlings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;i&gt;My Waffle Dreams&lt;/i&gt;, author &lt;b&gt;Norman Rawlings&lt;/b&gt; shares an eclectic collection of both thought-provoking and light-hearted personal essays inspired by his life experiences, relationships, and loves. &lt;p&gt;
For Rawlings, clarity and epiphanies arrive like bolts of lightening; as he responds to his circumstances and describes what he has ventured out and found through self-discovery and reflection, he leads the way for others to do the same. As he takes a witty, whimsical look at love and relationships, he tackles the often hilarious differences between men and women, questioning why his date orders a salad for lunch and then eats half of his cheese fries. Rawlings shows a more serious, introspective side when he reminds us of good that comes from the sacrifices of others, challenges us to strengthen our character before it is too late, and teaches us to become more adaptable and open our heart to forgiveness. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;My Waffle Dreams&lt;/i&gt; presents a compelling collection of essays that encourages others to look at life in an entirely new way." />
