  <title>THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED - Abdul Nassar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abdul Nassar has written this book THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED because he believes his experience and real stories narrated in the book will help the student community, who may be going through similar challenging situations and difficult circumstances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The book is written to instil hope, inspire students to set high goals in their lives and most importantly to achieve those goals, aspirations and dreams in life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Nassar, who was born and brought up in a village atmosphere, an economically challenging family environment with less access to good, formative education systems, has courageously fought all the challenges one after another and come up a long way in life. He is a B. Com. rank holder, a Chartered Accountant by profession and has worked in the Oil and Gas industry for the last two decades. He is currently employed in a senior finance position with one of the best national oil companies in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
He has narrated all his life experiences and most importantly the lessons he learned from those experiences openly and fearlessly in this book, that too in his own simple narrative English language, which any non-native speaker can easily understand. The Author has also set up a charitable foundation and the net sale proceeds of this book will be contributed for the philanthropic purposes of that foundation.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There are no obstacles in life, there are only opportunities in disguise. Opportunities to adapt and improve&amp;rdquo;- Abdul Nassar&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There is no limit, everything is possible. It is all about continuous improvement&amp;rdquo;- Abdul Nassar&lt;br /&gt;
