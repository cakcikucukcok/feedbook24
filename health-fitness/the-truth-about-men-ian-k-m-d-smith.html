  <title>The Truth About Men - Ian K. M.D. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Men don&#39;t have glass heads.  What&#39;s going on in there? Do they mean what they say?  And what are they &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; saying? Why does anyone in a relationship with a man have to spend so much time wondering what things &quot;mean&quot;? Is it good that he called instead of texting?  What does it mean that he introduced me to his sister but not his mother or his best friend?  Why hasn&#39;t he said anything about my birthday yet when it&#39;s two weeks from now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a man who knows what&#39;s going on in there has written a book to decode men for you. It&#39;s rich with insight and action you can take today to make your relationship better tomorrow.  Smith&#39;s fascinating, sometimes surprising topics include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--The Subtle Art of Hooking Us (men really do want to be in committed relationships, even if they don&#39;t always show it) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Beauty Matters (but beauty may not be exactly what you think it is)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Beware of Titles (why you shouldn&#39;t label yourself his &quot;girlfriend&quot; until certain conditions are met) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Sex is More Powerful than an AK-47 (but it doesn&#39;t always have to be a home run)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Mean What You Say (and why sex lies are always--always--a bad idea)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Know how to Listen and What we Care About (it doesn&#39;t matter if you buy the yellow pillows or the blue pillows but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t matter)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any man who picks up &lt;i&gt;The Truth About Men&lt;/i&gt; will nod in agreement, and any woman who puts its insights into practice will have an instantly happier mate and a stronger, longer relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
