  <title>How to love consciously - kelechi ogbonna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being aware that you want to love and giving that love are two different things. Sometimes marriage and relationships end because one person does not understand how to love or care for the other; or one person refuses to take care of the other.&lt;br /&gt;
Love is a choice. Mary Beth and I often say that getting married is like a full-time job - you take what you put in it.&lt;br /&gt;
Our marriage is like a treasure. My wife and I keep it and don&amp;#39;t expect to return the money. But if we request an exception, there is no charge.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, we discuss the temperature of a car or who forgot to feed the dog, but only when it is really necessary. When it&amp;#39;s really important, we make the right choice to give us the love we need.&lt;br /&gt;
After more than 23 years of marriage, we have found that these techniques work best for intentional love. true love and true love&lt;br /&gt;
Show your gratitude&lt;br /&gt;
A simple greeting and a reaction to something small or normal can make a big difference. It takes time to say these two words, but the effect has been felt for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;
Expressing gratitude is also the best strategy for making sure things are grateful to you. When we stop and tell our partners what we are grateful for, we also say to the universe. Thanks to the efforts and determination to express our gratitude, we are in a better position to obtain more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to thank yourself, first express your gratitude.&lt;br /&gt;
