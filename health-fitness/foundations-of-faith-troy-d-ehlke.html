  <title>Foundations of Faith - Troy D. Ehlke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miracles can take up to 40 weeks to occur. It is amazing to behold that with Gods blessing and breath, new life is formed in merely 280 days. Regardless of what we have seen before, there is nothing so powerful as witnessing the birth of a child. A world bellowing with destruction and chaos cannot detract from the wonder of a newborns cry nor can the radiance of earthly gems outshine the brilliance emanating from youthful eyes. Yet, in a matter of moments, the joy of fatherhood is trespassed. Fear creeps into our stream of conscious thought. What can I possibly offer this incarnation of love? If we are fortunate, we know our shortcomings and have taken inventory of our failures, because the strength of fatherhood lies not within the realm of self-proclaimed virtues or gifted abilities, but in our willingness to be present with our own vulnerabilities. We hear this truth from our heavenly Father who tells us to Consider your own call: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But I chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; I chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; I chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in my presence. The source of your life is Christ Jesus, who became wisdom for the world (adapted reading of 1 Corinthians 1:26-30). This book chronicles the journey of one mans quest to explore his past alongside the wisdom of scripture, so that his son, Julian, might pursue pathways of wholeness which his father failed to follow. Through personal trials and encounters with the world, this father forges an understanding that he wishes to pass on to his son, hoping it blesses his life. With prayer, wisdom, and a relationship rooted in love, a father embarks on an inner exploration, in an effort that the errors of today need not be repeated tomorrow. Righteous living is not an accidental phenomenon but rather an intentional choice shaped by loving forces within ones life. In the end, no one knows the ways of man or his son, save one; and he generously affords his creation the space to choose as their will desires. If you are a father raising a child or are simply searching for a voice of practical wisdom in a world filled with illusions, read these letters. Insight has a way of not only transforming the heart, but also redirecting the soul towards that which is life-giving and not life-consuming. But whatever you do from this moment on, know that there are few truths in the world; and when you find them, embrace them, because they have the power to steer you in the right direction. You are holding on to a book that contains such wisdom. Continue your quest within." />
