  <title>The Legacy of Passion - Geri G. Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="HE LICKED THE SPOON AFTER DIPPING IT INTO A JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER AND I QUICKLY WARNED HIM, &#39;&#39;DONT PUT THE SPOON BACK INTO THE JAR!!! 
&#39;&#39;HE ANSWERED QUIETLY&#39;&#39;
&#39;&#39;IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT THAN KISSING YOU.&#39;&#39;
MY HEART POUNDED. I CAUGHT MY BREATH,
SCENE; IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOKING DESK, AT THE TAMPA POLICE STATION.
THEY WERE THE FIRST WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED. 
AND ILL NEVER FORGET THEM.
&#39;&#39;I KNEW YOU WANTED ME TO KISS YOU&#39;&#39; HE WhISPERED.
THAT WAS A MEMORY OF OVER FORTY YEARS AGO.
WE WERE SITTING QUIETLY ONE EVENING SHARING SOME OF THOSE EARLY MEMORIES OF THE MANY PASSIONATE DAYS AND NIGHTS SO LONG AGO.
LIKE A CHILD WHO SAY&#39;S &#39;&#39;READ IT AGAIN OR TELL ME AGAIN, &#39;&#39;I LOVED TO LISTEN TO THOSE MEMORIES REPEATED OVER AND OVER.
BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HE REVEALED TO ME THAT HE KNEW THAt PASSION IN MY SPIRIT WAS LONGING FOR HIS LIPS TO TOUCH MINE." />
