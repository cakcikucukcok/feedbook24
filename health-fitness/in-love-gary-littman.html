      <meta name="description" content="In the 1960s a rock group called The Youngbloods produced a song titled Get
Togetherthe content of this book is a reflfl ection of a lyric within that songthe
words are: We are but a moments sunlight fading in the grass.
No words can better describe the lives of two people falling in love and going
through lifes journey experiencing both good times and tragedies. This book is
an amazing story of true and enduring love. Life is like a book with a beginning,
middle, and ending, and this story has all of those elements.
For those people who are in love or are about to fall in love, this book is a way
to fifi nd out what it means to be truly In Love. It is a view into the minds of two
people who, through their baby boomer time line, build family, careers, friendships,
and battle unforeseen events that change and rock their world. It is a way
to show how love, devotion, and caring can make life worth living even through
the roughest times.
For those who have already read this book, the reviews have been ones of emotion,
self-reflfl ection, and revelation.
Comments have been:
 A must read for the Baby Boomer Generation.
 Fantastic.
 An accurate time line covering forty years,
 I couldnt stop crying.
 My life is similar to yours.
 I didnt know love could be so wonderful.
 How did you get through life with all the bombs going off around you?
Although this book discusses events from the 1960s through the present, the
story told crosses all generations, past, present, and future. The theme of love is
timeless and the people in the book can be you, relatives, or neighbors." />
