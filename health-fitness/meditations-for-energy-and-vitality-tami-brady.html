  <title>Meditations for Energy and Vitality - Tami Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meditations for Energy and Vitality is a selection of my favorite mediations and guided imageries. I have in the past and continue to use these exercises to motivate and energize me on those low energy days. In fact, many of these little gems got me through some pretty tough Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome bouts. Perhaps, more importantly, I have also found these practices to be extremely useful in recognizing (and letting go of) the unhealthy energy drains in my life. This compilation takes both a physical and a mental approach to energy and vitality. Thus, in the first half of the work, the focus is in on energizing, inspiring, and motivating. Then, our attention is turned inwards. In essence, we are searching for hints about where our energy is misused or misplaced. In using this knowledge, we can then literally release stagnant energy, freeing it up for daily use." />
