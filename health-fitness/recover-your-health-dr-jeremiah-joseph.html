  <title>Recover Your Health - Dr. Jeremiah Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on cutting-edge medical breakthroughs, &lt;em&gt;Recover Your Health&lt;/em&gt; combines four topics that can help you shed stubborn and unwanted pounds, dramatically increase your energy and vitality, protect you against cancer, and slow the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answer yes to any of the following, something may be interfering with your body&#39;s ability to restore itself back to its normal state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Are you groggy in the morning or tired throughout the day?
Are you exercising and eating well without losing weight?
Do you have pain somewhere in your body that you are not getting relief from?
Do you have a health condition that has not been helped with conventional medicine?
Does your brain feel foggy with a lack of mental clarity?
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not alone. Highly acclaimed author and speaker Dr. Jeremiah Joseph unleashes his four remarkably easy-to-follow strategies that show you how you can feel confident and in control of your health again. Dr. Joseph reveals four things that everyone needs in order to restore their health, increase muscle and decrease fat, recover childlike energy, combat disease, and enhance memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body has an amazing ability to heal, repair, and regenerate itself from the day-to-day wear and tear, as long as nothing is interfering with this potential. The secret to unleashing these powers lies not in tricking the body with chemicals or surgery but finding the underlying cause and removing the interference. Remove chemical, physical, or emotional interferences, and the body can heal from just about any disease. In one section, Dr. Joseph shares five well-known and easy-to-acquire nutritional supplements that everyone on the planet must have in order to live and age harmoniously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibrant health, life extension, and an all-encompassing sense of well-being is well within our reach. Practical and easy to follow, &lt;em&gt;Recover Your Health&lt;/em&gt; finally provides solutions to questions thousands and thousands of patients have been asking for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
