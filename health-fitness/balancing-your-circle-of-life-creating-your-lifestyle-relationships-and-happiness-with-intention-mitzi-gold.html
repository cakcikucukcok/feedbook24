Editorial Reviews  &quot;Every journey starts with a step. Be sure you are shipping in the right direction. Dr. Mitzi Gold will help you take your next step to transform your life.&quot; - John Gray, Ph.D., author of Men are from Mars Women are from Venus   &quot;Dr. Mitzi Gold has written one of the best self-help books I have read in years. It puts happiness into the reader&#39;s hands, attitudes, and intentions. It reminds me of the Greek philosopher Epictetus who remarked, &#39;It is not what happens to us that is important, it is how we react to the event that is important.&#39; He knew about the role of intention centuries ago, and his advice is spelled out in this life-changing book. Dr. Gold&#39;s Circle of Life process gives readers told they need to transform their lives and feel grateful for the journey.&quot; - Stanley Krippner, Ph.D. co-author Personal Mythology   &quot;Williams James, the father of American psychology, said, &quot;The transition from tenseness, self-responsibility, and worry, to equanimity, receptivity, and peace, is the most wonderful of all those shiftings of inner equilibrium... and the chief wonder of it is that it so often comes about, not by doing, but by simply relaxing and throwing the burden down.&quot; In Balancing Your Circle of Life, Dr. Mitzi Gold shows us how to unburden ourselves of negative habits and beliefs that limit our life&#39;s possibilities. If you are ready for greater joy, creativity, and fulfillment, this book is for you.&quot; -Larry Dossey, M.D. Author of Healing Words, Reinventing Medicine, The One Mind and One Mind: How Our Individual Mind is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why it Matters   &quot;Dr. Gold&#39;s book is a blessing for anyone who wants to have a healthier, happier, longer, more fulfilled life.&quot; - Patricia Bragg, N.D., Ph.D.  &quot;A good self-help book has to stretch your envelope of possibility, lead you into asking new questions and exploring new areas, and help you organize what you do to achieve a clear goal. This book meets all these criteria and more. Dr. Gold has synthesized many years of work into a clear, inspiring and energizing package. She puts complex thoughts and insights into simple pathways for a book that can be more used than simply read.&quot; -Dennis Jaffe, Ph.D. author of Healing from Within   &quot;Our resilient and creative powers can open doors and bring new life options, if we are willing to look honestly and risky change. This engaging book offers both tools and stories so it can happen for us.&quot; -Dr. Ruth Richards, Saybrook University, and Author/Editor, Everyday Creativity and New Views of Human Nature.
