  <title>In Sickness and in Health - Rena Blake Dillman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Sickness and In Health was birthed by a single incident, or divine appointment, as I believe it to be. Not wanting to forget a single word or detail I immediately wrote each down. Eventually I shared a little of the story with David Webster who helped edit my first book. He wrote in his notes back to me, This is your next book!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shortly after this I received an e-mail from David Oltman, one of my art students. It read, I hope you are writing down your raw emotions and innermost feelings as well as your tremendous blessings during this challenging time in your life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I thought about that statement, I was prompted in my spirit to write our story knowing it was one many could relate to in their own lives. I pray it will be an encouragement to those going through the tests and trials of sickness and disease. May it also be a special blessing to all the caregivers. God&#39;s promises are true, and prayer is powerful!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
