  <title>The Self-Care Solution - Jennifer Ashton, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABC&amp;#8217;s chief medical correspondent helps you ring in the New Year right with a resolution that&amp;#8217;s actually doable: a year-long plan to improve your emotional and physical health&amp;#8212;from giving up alcohol to doing a digital detox, but each for only one month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jennifer Ashton is at the top of her field as an ob-gyn and news correspondent. But even at the top there&amp;#8217;s still room to improve, and with &lt;em&gt;The Self-Care Solution&lt;/em&gt;, she upends her life one month at a time, using her own experiences to help you improve your health and enhance your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ashton becomes both researcher and subject as she focuses on twelve separate challenges. Beginning with a new area of focus each month, she guides you through the struggles she faces, the benefits she experiences, and the science behind why each month&amp;#8217;s challenge&amp;#8212;giving up alcohol, doing more push-ups, adopting an earlier bedtime, limiting technology&amp;#8212;can lead to better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Month by month, Dr. Ashton tackles a different area of wellness with the hope that the lessons she learns and the improved health she experiences will motivate her (and you) to make each change permanent. Throughout, she offers easy-to-comprehend health information about the particular challenge to help you understand its benefits and to stick with it. Whether it&amp;#8217;s adding cardio or learning how to meditate, Dr. Ashton makes these daily lifestyle choices and changes feel possible&amp;#8212;and shows how beneficial a mindful lifestyle can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiring, practical, and informative, illustrated with helpful photos and charts, &lt;em&gt;The Self-Care Solution &lt;/em&gt;teaches you how to recalibrate your life to enjoy a better, healthier year, one month at a time. Featuring guidance from top experts, entertaining case studies, easy-to-follow advice and tips, and Dr. Ashton&amp;#8217;s observations and insights, this book can help you achieve a better life balance and a more active and healthy lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;" />
