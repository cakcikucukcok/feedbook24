  <title>Supreme Sacrifice - Rita Malie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When April finally opens the door to the past, she comes face to face with her guilt.                                                                                                                         Inspired by true events, Supreme Sacrifice takes you on a journey spanning three decades, which begins in a steel mill town in the Midwest during the height of unionism in the 1960s.  April is the pride and joy of her father, Josef Straka, a first generation American, once a successful businessman at the top of his game, whose alcoholism soon brought the family to the depths of despair. 
Aprils spiritual journey begins when her father dies in a mysterious car crash. Every night she is plagued with a dark cloud of haunting, recurring nightmares.  Her days arent much better living in this blue-collar, steel city shrouded in post-industrial gloom and overcast skies. Married young, she struggles to complete her academic studies, which launch her into the business world. She and her husband decide to move to the South. 
Just when she thought she had left her past behind forever, nightmares return coincidentally on the heels of a stormy, complicated relationship with a new friend. April is introduced to new spiritual tools and friends who help pull her back from the edge and into an obsessive search for the answers to her fathers accident. Storm clouds slowly begin to part when she learns how to tap the power and strength from within by changing how she sees her past, forgiving herself and others. 
Malie spins a compelling story of a young womans journey to self-discovery, and the transformation of Aprils awakening and ultimate redemption to accomplish her dreams." />
