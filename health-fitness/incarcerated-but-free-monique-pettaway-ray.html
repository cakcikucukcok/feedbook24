  <title>Incarcerated but Free - Monique Pettaway-Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Six months after newlywed Monique Pettaway-Ray landed her first teaching job as an eighth-grade science instructor in Huntsville, Alabama, her world suddenly imploded. Her husband was convicted for murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. A vital part of her life was ripped from herand Monique didnt know how to cope.   
Deeply honest and heartfelt, &lt;i&gt;Incarcerated but Free&lt;/i&gt; shares how Monique broke the bars of her mental prison, forged an incredible faith in the Lord, and embarked on a path to help families of incarcerated individuals find hope and healing. Monique explores the doubts, fears, and perplexities that often accompany those who have a loved one in prison, and shares the coping strategies she developed to combat each challenge.
Monique uses biblical passages to emphasize the important role God played in her journey, and includes questions for meditation and reflection at the end of each section. From overcoming shame to dealing with anger and frustration, Moniques helpful, compassionate voice offers encouragement for those suffering from their own form of incarceration.
A unique blend of memoir and self-help, &lt;i&gt;Incarcerated but Free&lt;/i&gt; offers faith-filled inspiration to bring light to your darkest days." />
