  <title>My Escape from the Captivity of Anxiety and Depression - Jb Dum치s</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Had my health begun to deteriorate due to a physical condition, or were the effects of depression and anxiety
taking a devastating toll on my life? Whatever the source
of this bewildering predicament, my family and I were suffering from the perilous grip of a living hell. A darkness and unexplainable strangeness had managed to sew its way into my very being that unfortunately had affected everyone I loved, in a way that I wouldnt wish upon my worst enemy. Each day, I fell deeper and deeper into a mysterious abyss of despair that I could not seem to escape; rather, I became captive within my own consciousness. It wasnt until I finally surrendered to the truth that I was able to slowly liberate my mind, body and soul from the hopelessness and anguish I was experiencing, and gradually reacquaint myself to the real world. This is my story, something that happened to me. Realizing that there are countless others who are at present encountering situations similar to my own experiences, it is my desire to shed some light from the knowledge I obtained along my journey to recovery, in hope of possibly guiding another lost soul to discover his or her way home.
