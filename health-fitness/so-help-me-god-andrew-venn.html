  <title>So Help Me God - Andrew Venn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For many decades, mankind has become more conscious and responsible about the need to recycle. It is my belief that mankind itself has been recycled since the creation of the world, but who am I to declare that? Im not a professor of science; neither am I somebody who is familiar (or should be!) with a padded cell. I am merely a young (all right, middle-aged!) man that experienced near death but survived to tell his story of his world and visions witnessed/seen while in a coma, the relevance of them now, and my thoughts about our future existence. I do not have delusions; neither am I a fantasist. I am as sane as the next man (you ask my pet elephant). Mind you, it depends on who the next man is!
Reliving my story has been very intriguing and interesting, and it has developed in me a greater understanding and appreciation of life. Previously unexplainable imagery seen while in a coma was later recognized. But how can I survive this, and in what condition will I emerge?
The thoughts and ideas that I express are not intended to offend, and I apologize to anyone who is offended by my words. I am certainly not a preacher; neither do I seek pity." />
