  <title>The Female Baller&#39;s Handbook: 10th Anniversary Edition - Ronnell &quot;Chewy&quot; Coombs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You DON&#39;T have to work like a slave to eat like a Queen. You DON&#39;T have to be bored on Friday night.... You SHOULD NOT be giving your body to a man who is not, and will, not be paying your bills. You SHOULD NOT be around chicks who can&#39;t come together to hustle. You DON&#39;T have to get cheated on.  You don&#39;t have to be in school, but uncertain on how to make your certification work after you graduate. You can outperform the supervisor at work (if she is a woman) or work HIM (if he is a good looking man). Winning IS NOT far-fetched. ALL YOU NEED IS A NEW PLAYBOOK.  &quot;The Female Baller&#39;s Handbook&quot; is the new playbook for women who plan to win the game of life.  In it, author Ronell &quot;Chewy&quot; Coombs, gives women the truth about all those perplexing questions that the modern female deals with on her way to the top." />
