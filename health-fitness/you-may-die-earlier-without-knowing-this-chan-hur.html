  <title>You May Die Earlier Without Knowing This? - Chan Hur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Malinger (feign illness)?
Even many people suffer from various pains, discomfort, disease, all kinds of tests show normal. What&#39;s wrong?
1.	 Modern medicine may treat less than 30% of various diseases, but the general population believes medical doctors treat 80-100%.
2.	Most tests cant find the cancer cells less than 5mm. Then there is no cancer. Now you see the picture. 
Factors that cause cancer
1.	Damp heat
As far as I know, I am the first one who has claimed the damp heat is the cause of cancer. If we dont know the real cause, we are not able to prevent and fight against the cancer. I would like to receive the Nobel Prize based on this fact. If everyone follows and keeps the contents of this book, cancer can be prevented very easily.
2.	The lack of immune system
When the immune system is low, cancer cells would grow and the body cant best the cancer cells.
How to increase the immunity?
3.	Chemical and environmental causes
This is true, but it is almost impossible to cope with them as an individual. For example, can we remove all plastics from modern life?
The author would try to explain all wonders related with health with very simple words." />
