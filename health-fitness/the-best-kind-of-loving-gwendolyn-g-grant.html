  <title>The Best Kind of Loving - Gwendolyn G. Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It has often been said that &quot;if white America has a case of the sniffles, Black America catches walking pneumonia.&quot; When this credo is applied to relationships, common problems such as inadequate communication, commitment fears, financial struggles and infidelity carry an even greater weight. Yet, with hundreds of relationship books on the market, virtually none has explored the specific circumstances impacting relationships between African-American men and women. &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Best Kind of Loving: A Black Woman&#39;s Guide to Finding Intimacy&lt;/em&gt;, renowned psychologist Dr. Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant addresses head-on the complex challenges in African-American relationships. &quot;In addition to the social dynamics affecting male-female communications in general, as African-Americans, we carry the added burdens of myths and stereotypes that grow out of our real history of slavery, second-class citizenship and economic disenfranchisement,&quot; Grant explains. &lt;p&gt;In writing &lt;em&gt;The Best Kind of Loving&lt;/em&gt;, Grant has provided an invaluable resource for Black women searching to understand the choices they make, the men they love and how to make the most of their strength, intelligence and wit. Compulsively readable, &lt;em&gt;The Best Kind of Loving&lt;/em&gt; is unique in its scope and vision; women of all races and backgrounds will laugh, sympathize and nod their heads in recognition as they read about others not unlike themselves. Giving both pragmatic and realistic advice, Grant serves both as an advisor and confidant; she knows which situations may not work out, but also gives women ways to make the best of less-than-ideal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
