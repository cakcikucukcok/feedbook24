  <title>Give Me One Good Reason... - Avis P. Raines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Give Me One Good Reason is a tale of love, passion, and commitment, but yet there&#39;s betrayal, dishonesty, deception, and deceit.   It gives you a twisted perception of a certain situation and then explodes into the unthinkable.  But just when you think that all hope is gone, as we sometimes feel in life, there&#39;s a silver lining.  That certain someone or something comes along and makes it all better.  We  can either accept certain situations, people, and things within our lives or we can let it go.  We know that life isn&#39;t always as sweet as a bed of roses, but it doesn&#39;t have to be a bed of thorns either.  Give Me One Good Reason is just that tale of failure to Faith.  Life sometimes come with drama and dissatisfaction, but you don&#39;t have to deal with that and why would you want to.  It&#39;s all about being happy and enjoying life to the fullest.  Happiness starts with you and you only, other people may come along to enhance that happiness or add to it.  Never let anyone determine your happiness, because they can be a part of your life one moment and decide to walk out the next." />
