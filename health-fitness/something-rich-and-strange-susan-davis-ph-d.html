  <title>Something Rich and Strange: - Susan Davis  Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something Rich and Strange&lt;/i&gt; breathes fresh air into a tired list of psychological how-to and theological you-should books. In this inspiring work, psychologist Susan Davis guides us through a process of self-discovery and personal growth toward new freedom, deeper love, and more joyous living. Using the biblical stories of the Exodus and of Jesus death and resurrection, ideas from modern psychology, and the words of writers, poets, and ordinary people, she shows that the path of the transformative journey is well traveled and available to us today. She includes a foreword by Eugene Peterson, author of &lt;i&gt;The Message&lt;/i&gt;, and chapter-by-chapter questions for group discussion or personal reflection.  This book is an invaluable map for those who are on the journey of psychological healing and spiritual formationand for those who guide them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most distinctive thing about Dr. Daviss account of her work is that in weaving this tapestry using the threads of story and poetry and psychology, she does her work on a loom constructed from the parallel stories of the exodus of the Hebrews and the death and resurrection of Jesus. Reading &lt;em&gt;Something Rich and Strange&lt;/em&gt; puts us in the unhurried and gentle company of a friend. &lt;br /&gt;Eugene Peterson, author and professor emeritus of spiritual theology, Regent College, British Columbia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recognized how great an impact reading this book has had on me, and I believe this response is possible for anyone who would be willing to read Daviss book and allow it to read them as well. There is definitely a revealing process that takes place in the reader as they make connections to the correlating realities of their own journey out of slavery and into freedom, rather, wholeness. &lt;br /&gt;Hefti Brunhold, seminary student, Fuller Seminary, Northern California&lt;/p&gt;" />
