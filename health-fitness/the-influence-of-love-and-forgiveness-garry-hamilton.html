  <title>The Influence of Love and Forgiveness - Garry Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The shock and pain of having a close sibling suddenly and violently cut down by a heartless gunman affects different people in many different ways. 
This true story will show how one individual was adversely affected by such an event, and how his feelings of retribution would become a poisonous potion that would change his life forever. 
He explains, how following the shock, he was diagnosed with a serious health condition. 
However, by choosing to decline the offer of conventional medicine, and to turn his back on the very root of his affliction, he was able to regain his health and wellbeing. 
Now he shares with you some of those exact methods he applied which enable him to achieve his ultimate goal of reclaiming his health. 
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears (Kahlil Gibran)." />
