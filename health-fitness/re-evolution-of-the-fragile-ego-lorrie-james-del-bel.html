  <title>Re-Evolution of the Fragile Ego - Lorrie James Del Bel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the midst of an innocent conversation with his neighbor, author Lorrie Del Bels life was forever changed.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;His neighbor was unsure about leaving his labor job to become a supervisor. He felt himself incapable of bossing people around and disciplining them for not doing their job. He confessed these feelings as though he was afflicted with a fatal disease or shameful deformity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But the remarks sent Lorrie on a journey of self-reflection, examining his own life, purpose, the type of leader he was and what drove him to succeed. He began to understand that the essence of leadership was not based upon what is achieved, but rather on the condition of a persons ego and their intentions as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Join Lorrie on his journey of self-discovery as he explores the poison of pessimism and the underlying root cause. Growing to acknowledge weaknesses and finding strength in doing so.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Follow the course he lays out; the principle cornerstones for the re-evolution of the fragile ego, then the functional cornerstones necessary to lead others successfully.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lorrie shares his journey for others to use as a guide, in discovering their true self and purpose, and become fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;" />
