  <title>Bought with a Price - James M. Doherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bought with a Price takes you inside the lives and principles of the life of Patrick E. Doherty, a father of eight, grandfather of thirty-four, and great-grandfather of eleven. The priorities he lived by and the love he demonstrated in raising his children serve as a parents guide to raising children in an environment of faith and family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His simple, straightforward views are timeless. On happiness, he said, You will never be happy in life until you learn to celebrate the success of others. On conflict resolution: Always give people the chance to do the right thing. He loved His Lord and lived an unapologetic life dedicated to His service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His life ended with a four-year battle with esophageal cancer. This narrative recalls the way he fought the battle and the self-examination this imposed on our family. We open up some very personal letters, poems, wedding vows, and decisions from various family members that demonstrate the principles of my father in the hopes that you can benefit from our experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
