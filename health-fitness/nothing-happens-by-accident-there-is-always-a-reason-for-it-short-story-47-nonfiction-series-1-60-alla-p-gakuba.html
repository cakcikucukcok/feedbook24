Than, I started using a common sense and started analyzing why my blood pressure shut up at night to a life-threatening level. And went through inventory of my other illnesses. Medicine is an art, it is not an engineering, which has formulas. Just go to 5 different physicians and get 5 different diagnosis.&amp;nbsp; I learned a lot how to analyze an event, in this case my sudden illness. These discoveries I share in this story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
