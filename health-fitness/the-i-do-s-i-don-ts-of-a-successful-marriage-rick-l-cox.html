  <title>The I Do’S &amp; I Don’Ts of a Successful Marriage - Rick L. Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I realize there are many self-help books covering a variety of issues. My desire, however, was to write a book about the marital relationship that is easy to read yet has enough substance to positively impact readers on a level that would motivate an inward desire to change for the better. This is a book that will open the eyes of readers to the fact that they are as normal as anyone else. It is a book showing how a few changes or corrections in ones daily interaction with ones spouse could make for a better tomorrow. The reader will learn not to react, responding instead with the right motive and attitude. The reader will be able to see how, by doing the right things, ones life can change for the better, and so can the lives of all in the household. 
I grew up hearing how difficult the marital relationship is due to the differences between men and women. I heard about how women are hard to figure out or that most men never know what it is their wives want. In my life, I have not found this to be true. What I have found is that it takes a conscious effort on my part to observe and get to know my wife, her likes and dislikes, her wants, hopes dreams, and desires. During this observation I learned she did not like all the things I did, and that was okay. I learned to accept the fact that she might not want to do what I want to do, and it is okay if I dont want to do what she wants. I learned she was romantic and even has her own personal language. This is a language she and other women appear to understand, but it didnt readily make sense to me. 
I believe you will find this book to be quite informative and to the point. It will make you think hard about how you interact with your spouse on a daily basis. It will also teach you something about the most important college you will ever attend: the college of life." />
