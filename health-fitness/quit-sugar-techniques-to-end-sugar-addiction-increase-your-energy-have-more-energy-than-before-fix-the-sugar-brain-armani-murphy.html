  <title>Quit Sugar: Techniques to End Sugar Addiction, Increase your Energy &amp; Have More Energy Than Before - Fix the Sugar Brain - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you feel stuck in a constant cycle of fatigue and snacking at work? Are you having difficulty turning down sweets in your attempt to lose weight? Are you struggling to eat healthy because good-for-you-foods just don&amp;rsquo;t give you the same high as sugary treats? If you answered yes to any of the above, you may have a sugar addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a serious issue for many people in today&amp;rsquo;s high-octane world, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got good news: Sugar addiction can be overcome. And even better news: Your energy levels will repair themselves, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be more energetic than you ever were when you were dependent on sugar.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But I&amp;rsquo;ve tried eating less sugar, and it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work,&amp;rdquo; you say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Would you be surprised if we agreed with you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re right: just &amp;ldquo;not eating&amp;rdquo; sugar is probably not going to work to kick your addiction to it. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re suggesting something much different: Our Sugar Addiction Annihilation Process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You see, we understand that overcoming an addiction isn&amp;rsquo;t just about willpower&amp;mdash;going into it believing that is sure to lead to failure. Instead, you need to attack the addiction on two separate fronts: science and psychology.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this concise, straightforward guide, you&amp;rsquo;re going to learn how to do just that. Here are just a few of the things you&amp;rsquo;ll learn:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The science behind addictions. Understand your enemy!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to use dietary changes and supplements to stop sugar cravings&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to optimize your new healthy diet to maximize your energy levels&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The psychology behind the addiction. Many addictions are an attempt at self-medicating. You need to understand yourself, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to develop your own arsenal against addiction: adaptive coping mechanisms&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
