  <title>Aging Backwards: Updated and Revised Edition - Miranda Esmonde-White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An updated edition of the eye-opening guide to anti-aging,&amp;#160;with a new chapter on fascia, which will publish in time for Miranda Esmonde-White&amp;#8217;s PBS pledge drive in June 2018&amp;#160;focusing on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every day, we have a very clear choice: We can grow older or we can grow younger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years the field of aging research has exploded with new clinical findings. Many widely accepted ideas about aging&amp;#8212;including those about the inevitability of our declining metabolism, our dying brain cells, and our deteriorating muscles and bones&amp;#8212;have been debunked. Today we know that the physical signs of aging are far more a product of lifestyle choices than of calendar years.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Aging Backwards&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;offers an exciting and comprehensive plan for actively slowing down and even reversing the aging process through gentle exercise that develops strong, flexible muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why focus on strengthening muscles? Because as Miranda Esmonde-White, PBS fitness personality and creator of the Essentrics technique, explains, our muscle cells are the keys to our longevity. The powerhouses of our cells, the mitochondria, keep us looking and feeling young&amp;#8212;and muscle cells contain more mitochondria than any other part of our body. If we can keep our mitochondrian fires burning, our muscles&amp;#8212;not to mention our bones, hearts, lungs, and skin&amp;#8212;can all experience the vitality of youth. And the best news of all is that it takes just thirty minutes a day of gentle exercise to keep muscles strong.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With eight basic age-reversing workouts that build core strength, lengthen and tone muscle, increase flexibility, and speed weight loss,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Aging Backwards&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;offers the information and tools to live longer, healthier, and happier lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
