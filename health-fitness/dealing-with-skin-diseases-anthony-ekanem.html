  <title>Dealing With Skin Diseases - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just like your brain, stomach and heart, your skin is also a valuable organ.  As a matter of fact, it is the largest organ in the body. However, it is very easy for us to take our skin for granted. Unless there is a problem, you might not give much attention to your skin, but you have to understand that the skin has a crucial task to do.   Our skin can multitask, as it has many essential functions and all of which are primarily designed to help keep the body working properly. If you will not pay attention to the health of your skin, it will not work effectively as it should.   The skin is like a bodyguard, as it offers a great level of protection. One of the most valuable jobs of the skin is to serve as a barrier to different harmful environmental aggressors such as UV radiation, bacteria and germs. The acid mantle of the skin is essential to prevent any bacteria from attacking the skin that could cause infection." />
