    	<p>It is often said that 80% of what happens to us in life is based upon how we think. Initially, I wrote this as a letter to read to our children when they graduated from high school.</p><p>I thought of this bookas I was driving down the road, takingour childrenfrom practice to practice and game to game. After we got past "how was your day?" There were many times with periods of awkward silence. Neither one of us knew what to talk about.This was a very difficult time for me. I am used to speaking in front of large crowds, but at this point I did not know what to say to my 10 year-old son. What was wrong with me? I felt foolish. So I stepped back, and analyzed my life and the lives of the successful people around me. I decided to teach my children about the things that it took me 40+ years of listening to my family, friends, mentors, taking seminars, reading books, listening to the tapes/CDs, etc. to learn to achieve success and happiness. There are hundreds of self help books, CDs, DVDs and seminars for adults. Why not teach this to kids and young adults? So I started talking to our children about positive life experiences and ways to lead a positive, happy, successful, productive life. This is what this book is about, helpingus to understand the game of life. I wanted our children to have a reference when struggling with the game of life and this book was the result of those efforts. This is a reference book that we can use again and againthroughout our life.</p><p>Together we can change the world by recognizing one positive experience at a time.</p>
