In &lt;i&gt;Progressivism: Our Road to Serfdom,&lt;/i&gt; authors Zester and Marilyn Hatfield examine these questions and others in light of the historic realities of who we are, where we have come from, and where we are going in relation to wages, job security, full employment, personal wealth accumulation, and personal freedoms.&lt;p&gt;
The Hatfields discuss the causes and history behind the current failing economy and present a step-by-step understanding of how to rebuild our God-given capitalist foundations with greater success.

Moreover, it reveals the secrets and the inner workings of progressive socialismthe political and ideological barrier that stands between those who love America and the republics limited form of government.&lt;p&gt;
