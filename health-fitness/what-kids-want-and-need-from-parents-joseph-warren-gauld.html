  <title>What Kids Want and Need From Parents - Joseph Warren Gauld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;What Kids Want&amp;#151;And Need&amp;#151;From Parents&lt;/I&gt; is truly a seminal book in parenting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;It begins with one man&amp;#8217;s 50-year journey to discover a better way to prepare American kids for life and culminates with the amazing discovery: the biggest factor in children&amp;#8217;s success in life turns out to be dependent on how their parents deal with their own childhood!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher Joe Gauld sets out to change American education in the 60s, founding the Hyde School in Bath, Maine, committed to the idea every student is gifted with a unique potential. But by tracking Hyde graduates in life, he finds parenting a much larger influence on their later lives than schooling. So in 1974, he begins a program to regularly address parental growth and family issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hyde&amp;#8217;s extraordinary ability to bond family and school receives national media attention, and Hyde grows into a network of seven private and public schools, plus a national Hyde Biggest Job&amp;#174; parent program.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe increasingly centers his work on families, finding parenting heavily influenced by how parents were raised. So parents&amp;#8217; learning how to effectively deal with both the negative as well as the positive aspects of their upbringing becomes critical to effective parenting. Joe carefully leads the reader through this dynamic and ground-breaking parenting process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
