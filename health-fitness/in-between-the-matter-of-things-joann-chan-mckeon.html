  <title>In-Between: the Matter of Things - Joann Chan-McKeon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through powerful personal essays of synchronicity, mystical poetry, and original photographs that map the depth of subtle energies in auras to the drama of the universe, In Between takes you from quantum physics, from the light that guides from within you, weaves you through lifes tapestry, and then flies you through the cosmos. Your soul awakens as you see through the outer lens of science and the inner lens of spiritual vision, opening your mind and heart to put you in touch with other levels of reality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book you will discover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; visible elements of the soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; proof of the vital force in all things through Kirlian photography&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; where spirit meets matter; the place from where we are truly born&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; how our bodies vibrate the primordial and eternal sound of AUM and its omnipotence with the universe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; how DNA moves with spirit and heals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; how thoughts activate and create from a dormant field of the space in between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; how to elevate your vibrational frequency through synchronicities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; the science of crystals and why and how they heal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; the truth about the 11:11 phenomenon and the associated synchronicities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my favorite mantra is everything is interesting. Chan-McKeons journey through the mystery of spirit, energy, and the power of nature reminds us that 99 percent of that everything dwells in the unseen, where we must go if we want to find it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Burns, New York Open Center&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-Between: The Matter of Things is a work of art that will touch your soul. Through Joann Chan-McKeon&#39;s beautiful essays and high-vibrational images, you&#39;ll come away with an inspirational new perspective on your relationship to the cosmos and Universe. This book is worthy of a permanent place in the libraries of all spiritual seekers &lt;/p&gt;
