  <title>The Feeling - Clayten Tylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an Esoteric interpretation of Emanuel Swedenborg&#39;s spiritual writings. It is written from a sinner&#39;s perspective as a personal memoir, meant to impart spiritual guidance, by example. It is mostly, a hands-on self-help book on how to &quot;birth&quot; the Divine Feminine Essence of Love. The author traces the Divine, back to its original source as Essential Love and Essential Innocence, which begins in the body as a sensual feeling of love, and through the process of regeneration, becomes the Word of God. And by sharing the spiritual feeling of the &quot;Word,&quot; as love, it becomes a blissful union with the Divine within, as the feeling of the &quot;New Church.&quot; The New &quot;Church,&quot; is the perception of an influx of spiritual love flowing from within as happiness. But it also has a two-fold purpose: For when the feeling of love from a sensual life has been transformed into the spiritual feeling of love, and when done on a mass scale, it ultimately manifests as the Brotherhood of Mankind, the feeling of Heaven on Earth." />
