  <title>From Ashes to Angel’S Dust: - Zoe Flowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like many young women, Zo Flowers found herself in a dangerous relationship in her early twenties. Flowers ended the relationship after a short time, but the experience motivated her to be a catalyst for real change. She started conducting candid interviews with women about their experiences with domestic, dating, and sexual violence. From Ashes to Angels Dust: A Journey Through Womanhood is the book that emerged from those early interviews. From Ashes to Angels Dust: A Journey Through Womanhood is a unique collection of candid interviews, national resources, healing techniques, and Zos poetry. From Ashes to Angels Dust: A Journey Through Womanhood is the story of our mothers, sisters, and grandmothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Zo, the book was wonderful! I shared it with a couple of my colleagues. I could see myself in several of the scenariospainful to recall. How in the world could any of us get ourselves into such sad and often brutal situations? Reading your book was like being in the midst of a motion picture. You captured so much pain. Thanks so much for touching my life - however briefly. May God protect you as you start your new journey. Stay free and HAPPY! Pauline M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago at our Saturday School in Soweto, we read one of the stories in the book about Lois and Brian. It really struck a familiar cord with our 50 high school students. After reading the short story, it was a great vehicle to talk about abuse. Again, thank you. Your book is helping many young lives here in Soweto, South Africa. Stay blessed Jose B.&lt;/p&gt;" />
