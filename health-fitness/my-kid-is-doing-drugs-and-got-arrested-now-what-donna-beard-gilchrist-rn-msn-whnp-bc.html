  <title>My Kid Is Doing Drugs and Got Arrested:  Now What? - Donna Beard Gilchrist Rn  Msn  Whnp-Bc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Kid is Doing Drugs and Got Arrested: Now What? is my story of hope and success.  The book gives information about the widespread societal problem of teen substance abuse.  It explains how teens become hopelessly addicted to drugs and the horrible feeling of craving that drives the teen to use drugs.  It alerts parents to the subtle signs of substance abuse and explains the connection with co-existing mental illness.  More importantly, I tell my personal story of my son, Matts rock bottom drive into the depths of addiction and his coexisting bipolar disorder, and how as a family we dealt with it.
You will learn about Matts arrest, rehab, and recovery told from my perspective as a mother and health care provider.  I offer insight into the feelings of fear, hopelessness, and failure as a parent. You will learn how this problem affected my family and how we weathered the storm.  I use stories that illustrate important issues for parents to recognize in their teens.  Suggestions for treatment are offered" />
