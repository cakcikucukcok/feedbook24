&lt;p&gt;Ethel M. Gardner is a woman of unusual force, integrity and great ability.  She is a prophetess, teacher, activist, author and counselor.  She comes from the humblest of backgrounds, a background of great challenges that served as a vehicle to great determination and a refusal to settle for less then Gods best.  Her hard work and desire for spiritual knowledge led her to higher heights in the Christian faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Gardner is the second of ten children and the mother of three.  She fell into the role of motherhood and assumed the responsibility for the care of the rest of her siblings at a very young age when she lost her own mother.  Her acts of compassion, courage, and bravery won her admiration and respect from both her family and her peers.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has always been one who, once she makes up her mind, is determined and will not allow obstacles stand in her way.   She finds a way around, over, or sometimes through them.  Determined to leave a legacy to her family, Ms. Gardner established the Kennedy Austin Development Center on March 10, 1998.  As president, her motto was: Family helping families heal through the impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
