      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re like most endurance ath­letes, you&#39;re concerned about your weight. You know that every extra pound slows you down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Fitzgerald&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Racing Weight Quick Start Guide&lt;/i&gt;  applies all the principles of his best-selling book &lt;i&gt;Racing Weight&lt;/i&gt;  in a detailed set of weight-loss training plans. You will devote 4 to 8 weeks to starting a weight loss of 5, 10, or 20+ pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lose weight quickly by following a schedule of high-intensity workouts and strength training as well as a menu of calorie-restricted, high-protein meals and snacks. Low-volume and high-volume plans make it possible for cyclists, runners, and triathletes with a wide range of experience to maintain their training levels. Replace fat with muscle while keeping your appetite in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve hit your quick start weight-loss goals, you will continue drop­ping unwanted pounds using the proven strategies of the &lt;i&gt;Racing Weight&lt;/i&gt; program. Zero in on your racing weight through improved diet quality, bal­anced macronutrient levels, proper timing of meals and snacks, appetite management, and training for lean body composition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Racing Weight Quick Start Guide&lt;/i&gt;  will accelerate your season goals so you&#39;ll be racing leaner and faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
