  <title>8 Weeks to SEALFIT - Mark Divine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;8 Weeks to SEALFIT&lt;/i&gt; plunges you into more than a workout program. Mark Divine&#39;s stories and assignments will develop your mental, emotional, intuitive and spiritual warrior as well as your physical warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What You Will Learn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;o Develop the character traits of a Navy SEAL&lt;br&gt;o Forge an unbeatable mind&lt;br&gt;o Adopt a level-headed approach to nutrition&lt;br&gt;o Gain exceptional overall strength and stamina&lt;br&gt;o Improve work capacity and durability&lt;br&gt;o Get the best functional workout available with the least amount of equipment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Sneak Peek into &lt;i&gt;8 Weeks to SEALFIT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It begins with your arrival as a Navy SEAL BUD/S cadet. There&#39;s no time to dilly dally. You either do the first workout and commit to this training, or don&#39;t bother. Next day, you move on to another challenge completely different than what you&#39;d expect. It&#39;s not the stuff for doubters, quitters, or complainers.&lt;br&gt;These 8 weeks will be hard. Mark will push your physical body to its limits and test your inner resolve. You&#39;ll be tempted to give up. But if you embrace the suck of the challenge, you&#39;ll begin to win. The stories and adventures Mark takes you on -- escaping battlefield danger, calming yourself when there&#39;s no way out, learning to trust your gut -- will tap into more power than you knew you had. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You&#39;ll begin to glimpse, and reach, your full potential. You&#39;ll develop the character that makes a Navy SEAL: discipline, drive, determination, self-mastery, honor, integrity, courage, and leadership. You&#39;ll thrive in a teamwork setting. You&#39;ll learn to laugh and not take your circumstances so seriously. You&#39;ll even know how to functionally train without equipment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the ground-breaking training that increases SEALFIT athletes&#39; overall endurance, work capacity, and toughness. Be someone special. Let&#39;s get started...&lt;/p&gt;" />
