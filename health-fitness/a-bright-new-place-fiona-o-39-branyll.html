  <title>A Bright New Place - Fiona O&#39;Branyll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fiona OBranyll was subject to severe abuse in the most tender and vulnerable years of her young life. How did she survive? This engaging story gives a vivid and practical picture of how the power of faith in God, and hanging on to His words, becomes a sustaining and permanent refuge during and after the worst of times. On her journey through loss and into peace, Fiona&#39;s faith ignited miraculous optimism within her, sustaining her spirit and soul throughout her life. Written with survivors of abuse in mind, this book will encourage anyone with a traumatic past, but it will also bring hope to every person going through challenging circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;
Mary Beth Griffis, MA, LMHC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona O&#39;Branyll&#39;s recounting of a horrendously destructive childhood brings light to God&#39;s power to transform a life. Hers is a great example of God giving a crown of beauty instead of ashes, oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. In reading her book, you will witness this supernatural transformation where God turns to good what man meant for harm. Fiona&#39;s transparency and honest recall reminds us of Abba Father&#39;s love for us.&lt;br /&gt;
Barbara Beck, co-host, TV45&#39;s The Good Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona O&#39;Branyll has a story of unimaginable pain as well as the redemption and life-transforming power of Jesus Christ. She movingly describes the terrors of abuse, the resulting bitterness and struggle to forgive, and the persistent, healing love of Jesus Christ. Saturated with Scripture and punctuated with poems she penned as a young adult, Fiona offers great hope to abuse victims as well as wise insights for those of us who desire to care for those who have suffered. &lt;br /&gt;
Mark Altrogge, pastor and songwriter&lt;/p&gt;" />
