  <title>Yesterday - Robert J. Firth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yesterday is a book that each of us needs to write based on who and what we were and have become; the sum total of our education and experiences as we made our way through our allotted years. Any of us can do this at any time but, to me, it seemed that in my younger and middle years there was never time. What Yesterday is then is a general reminiscing, a ruminating if you will, over my life and times. It&amp;#39;s not about me per se, but rather focuses on those verities and understandings learned along the way  that we all recognize to be true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book presents those thoughts and memories I felt worth passing on. In a way, writing this was like sifting through the detritus of seventy odd years, sort of panning for &amp;#39;gold,&amp;#39; letting my collected thoughts and experiences swirl in the pan, looking for those shining bits of value.  I&amp;#39;m certain that you too have such knowledge and I know that you too have probably considered setting them down for the ages- so, go ahead, do it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do it now. Once your mind ceases to function, overtaken by death or disease, memories evaporate like morning mist, as if they never were. While you can, I urge you to create, draw, film, write, do something to leave your mark. Keep a diary, record your experiences and thoughts.  You are valuable, you are unique, don&amp;#39;t pass us by without a sound. We need to hear what you have heard, we need to know what you have learned! So, tell us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here you will find thoughts on choices and directions, values and truths, morality and relationships. We present a great number of facts and opinions and ask our readers sift though them, taking and using whatever you believe of value, enriching your own thoughts and hopefully, passing them on to others." />
