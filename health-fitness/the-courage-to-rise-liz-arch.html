  <title>The Courage to Rise - Liz Arch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prescriptive and transformative plan to use yoga to heal pain, anxiety, depression, and other manifestations of unresolved trauma, by an internationally acclaimed yoga teacher.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not we&#39;re consciously aware of it, no one is spared from trauma. From catastrophic events to everyday experiences of traumatic stress, acclaimed yoga teacher Liz Arch is willing to bet that trauma has touched you or someone you love and may be affecting your physical, emotional, and mental health in surprising and devastating ways, causing symptoms such as anxiety, panic, depression, mood swings, fatigue, chronic pain, and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her own traumatic experience with domestic violence and an ensuing struggle with anxiety and panic attacks, Liz found her own path to holistic healing and became an advocate for those who have suffered from trauma. In &lt;em&gt;The Courage to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt;, Liz shows how trauma changes your brain and inhabits your body, creating a vicious cycle of physical and psychological distress. She offers an integrated approach to take control of your own healing and reclaim your wholeness through movement, mindfulness, and nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hopeful and sensible guide for healing unresolved manifestations of trauma naturally, addresses the three areas where trauma lives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;em&gt;The body. &lt;/em&gt;Move stuck emotions out of your muscles and tissues through twelve signature Primal Yoga movement sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;The brain. &lt;/em&gt;A series of meditations and mindfulness practices to rewire your brain and break free from repetitive thought patterns, overwhelming feelings, and painful memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;em&gt;The gut. &lt;/em&gt;Examine foods that may be exacerbating physical and mental dis-ease like caffeine, sugar, alcohol, and gluten; discover the best whole foods to stave off depression and anxiety; learn about mood-boosting supplements for brain and gut health; plus thirty delicious and nutritious recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Courage to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise &lt;/em&gt;gives invaluable insight into understanding the nature of trauma and shares practical and effective tools you can immediately implement to begin regulating your nervous system, strengthening your emotional resiliency, and transforming pain into your greatest power.&lt;/p&gt;" />
