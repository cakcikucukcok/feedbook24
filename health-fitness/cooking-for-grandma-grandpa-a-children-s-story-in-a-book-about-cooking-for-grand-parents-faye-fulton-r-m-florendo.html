  <title>Cooking for Grandma &amp; Grandpa a Children’S Story in a Book About Cooking for Grand-Parents - Faye Fulton, R.M. Florendo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cooking a meal for Grandma &amp; Grandpa was designed with the kids in mind. In todays society, kids are bombarded with so many ideas and influences that affect their development and growth during those informative years. Learning some basic rules of kindness, sharing, teamwork, loving family and friends, and problem-solving, all with a can-do attitude, could make all the difference in how they see themselves and others and especially those close to them.
This book was born out of the love a grandmother and grandfather have for their eleven grandchildren. Oftentimes, grandparents are the ones that the families look to for guidance. Having wisdom and knowledge through lifes experiences would set grandparents apart as the wise old ones. In this story, however, Grandma Faye has some hesitance about her eleven grandchildren coming to her home to cook a meal for them. However, the time has come when not only parents but also grandparents must trust what their grandchildren sometimes do, and in this case, their grandchildren. This is a book where the entire family learns to let go, trust one another, and have fun doing it.
Lets go inside this family story and see what happens when a plan unfolds and a meal comes together." />
