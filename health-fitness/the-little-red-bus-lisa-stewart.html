  <title>The Little Red Bus - Lisa Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In this childrens tale, Archangel Michael drives his little red bus along a winding road and picks up several of his delightful animal friends. Each special friend has a particular colour and gift to give to Michael. We follow their journey along the way and enjoy the magical ride as the story unfolds.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Archangel Michael has asked me to write this childrens book, as he feels it is a very mportant time spirituallya time to assist our children in understanding their divine roots and help keep them connected to their higher selves. Introducing them to the chakra system at such a young age may benefit these children he calls Rainbows of Light in many positive ways.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Chakras are spinning wheels of energy, centres of spiritual light held within our bodies energy field. When one becomes damaged or slow then if aff ects the others. This in turn aff ects our physical body, health and state of mind. When we focus on each chakra, as this book does, the positive eff ects of security, balance, harmony, health and vitality are attained. Colour therapy is used within this book, as well as mantras for each chakra and underlying messages that work on a higher level of consciousness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These children are the new building blocks of our world; they are the key. Lets treasure them, nurture them, plant the seed and watch them grow.&lt;/P&gt;" />
