  <title>I Hate to Leave on a Cloudy Day - Gene Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each day brings its own unique circumstances, challenges, and opportunities. What we do with each situation we face will bring more peace and serenity if we let our
passions be part of our response. In reality, how we live each day is often the result of what we love to do, perhaps only a few days each year, yet those few days can help us respond to each day in a way that makes it worth living, in the best sense of the word.&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;I Hate to Leave on a Cloudy Day&lt;/i&gt;, Larson describes what his passions are and
uses them to illustrate how he has fit together responses for many of lifes questions. While his passions may not be yours, the lessons learned from each thing you hold dear will let you react to every other thing in your life with a dedication that comes from knowing what you love.&lt;p&gt;
In his love for trout, Larson has become an ardent supporter of the environment in all its forms. In his creative cooking, he brings joy to a process that many find tiresome and tedious. In his newfound love for a dog, hes seen grace abound. What do you hold so dear that can define who you are and who you want to be?" />
