      <meta name="description" content="WHAT IF ITS TRUE?
What if its true?
What if the whole world is being misled into believing a lie?  What if Caesar and the names she instilled were meant to divert attention from God?  What if the cross that men and women bow before and honor is considered a graven image?  What if honoring the dead by bowing down before the image of the headstone is considered being disobedient to the command of God?
What if its true?
What if God only gave a name to one day for a reason?  What if the other names of days were given by man to support worshipping other gods?  What if Sunday was named to worship the sun as a god?  What if Monday was named to give praise to the moon?  What if Tuesday was named to give praise to Mars, who is known as the god of war?  What if Wednesday (wodens day) was named to give praise to Mercury?  What if Thursday (thors day) was named to give honor to the god Thor?  What if Friday was named to give honor to the goddess Venus?  What if Saturday was named to give praise to Saturn?  What if the whole world remembers the days of the week at the times they were intended, but forgets to remember the Sabbath at its appointed time? 
What if its true?" />
