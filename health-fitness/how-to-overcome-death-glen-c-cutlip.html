  <title>How to Overcome Death - Glen C. Cutlip</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The overcoming of death is a serious undertaking because death is a part of the nature one one&#39;s being; and therefore, not what it appears to be. When Death is reconciled with life, it becomes a means of interdimensional travel. We realize that it wasnt there in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, the overcoming of death is to take place within one&#39;s present consciousness, for death is the counterpart of life in the first place. Therefore, the resurrection unto life is from the death that is hidden in life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is the dead that appear to be living that are resurrected unto life. Death is something that is a part of ones present consciousness, not something off somewhere in the so-called afterlife&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The resurrection of the dead is unto conscious life or immortality, or back into the realm of unconscious death; for life and death occupy the same space. It is a matter of seeing death as it is, not just as it appears to be.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In that death is not what it appears to be, the overcoming of death is not what it appears to be. Therefore, it is a real possibility. It can be realized within ones lifetime.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Overcoming of Death is the means of bringing the realization of conscious immortality to the awareness of ones present consciousness in this lifetime. It reveals why it is that losing life is finding it, and how it is that it is the dead that are living that hear the voice of the Son of God and are resurrected from the dead.&lt;/P&gt;" />
