There is no such thing as COINCIDENCE.  LESSONS and MESSAGES come to us all from one source.  WE ARE ALL CONNECTED, you, me, and the UNIVERSE.

                                                *****
So when you make the CHOICE to let go of FEAR and CONTROL, allow CHANGE, FOLLOW YOUR HEART, practice GRATITUDE, GIVING AND RECEIVING, listen to the MESSAGES using all your SIX SENSES, learn from the LESSONS, ask for positive things and allow the ENERGY of the UNIVERSE to strengthen your BELIEF in ABUNDANCE, ATTRACTION, AND MANIFESTATION and that THOUGHTS BECOME THINGS, you will know that WE ARE ALL CONNECTED and it will be no COINCIDENCE that your deepest desires will come true and FLOW to you and you will have found HAPPINESS and know LOVE regardless of what MY SPIRITUAL PATH is or how I feel about SPIRITUALITY vs. RELIGION!" />
