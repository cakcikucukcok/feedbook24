  <title>The Marshall Plan: Being Good to Be Bad - Cindi Marshall Oakey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The Marshall Plan: Being Good to Be Bad&lt;/em&gt;
    is a compilation of decades trying to fight off weight gain due to overeating and overindulging. My husband and I joke, we are on the see-food diet: put it
    in front of us, and itll be gone. But when our pants got excruciatingly tight, and we even had to buy bigger jeans, something had to give; and giving in
    was not the choice we wanted to make.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Lets face it, we like to eat. And I bet you do to. Aside from eating being an integral component to live, its a huge element in our social life, and
    sometimes we fill our bellies when its really our hearts and soul that needs filling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The Marshall Plan: Being Good to Be Bad&lt;/em&gt;
    is relatively easy, but it is no book for dummies. We talk more about the how than the why. Therefore, it is a simple guide to eat, drink and look good. If
    you want to know more about the why, the Internet hosts endless blogs, charts and vast information about eating healthy foods. And guess what? There are so
    many choices, YOU really get to decide what you want to eat within the parameters of The Plan on a Good day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Remember, this is not a rigid prescription of healthy eating. Once you meet your desired goals, you choose when to Be Good, and when to Be Bad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The Marshall Plan: Being Good to Be Bad&lt;/em&gt;
    is a lighthearted guide. Its not a diet. Its a lifestyle choice.
