  <title>Words of Hope and Healing - Children&#39;s Advocacy Centers of Georgia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Directors in the Childrens Advocacy Centers of Georgia state network of CACs have collaborated on a book certain to provide words of future hope and healing for the courageous children who have been victims of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, or exploitation.  Indeed, anyone who has experienced a traumatic event, or have been the loved one of such a person, will find value and meaning to the thoughts and messages inside this book.  Our mission is to be, now and always, for the children.
___________________
People who work at Childrens Advocacy Centers go to work not just for a job, but in commitment to an important cause.  Ultimately, their response and involvement with a child who has alleged child abuse and the childs family, while significant, is relatively brief considering the future lifetime of a child.  However, this can be a critical pivot point for everyone involved.  With this book, the Childrens Advocacy Centers of Georgia, through the amazing words of the Executive Directors of Georgias CACs, seek to expand their positive influence beyond the immediate needs of child survivors of abuse and their families.  The words in this book are parting gifts for the children and families who are served in Childrens Advocacy Centers, for them to read and contemplate, and then re-read, in their own individual journeys toward health and healing (Chris Newlin, MS LPC, executive director, National Childrens Advocacy Center, Huntsville, Alabama)." />
