  <title>How to Be Better at Almost Everything - Pat Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BenBella can help Pat leverage his large social media following by providing insights into how to convert a social media platform into trade book sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pat has experience in designing successful on- and offline sales campaigns around books and digital products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outreach to email list of over 40K subscriber, from which Pat earns between $40-70K per month selling self-published books and online courses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outreach and promotion through Pat&amp;rsquo;s social media platform: Facebook (40K+ likes), YouTube (4 million+ views), and Instagram (33K followers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pat recently wrote a short book (&lt;em&gt;Repetition and Resistance&lt;/em&gt;) and self-published to Amazon, which hit #1 in several categories (Healthy Living, Exercise &amp;amp; Fitness, Short Reads) and earned over 125 five-star ratings on the first day from promotion on his social media alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outreach through Pat&amp;rsquo;s network, which includes other professionals, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling authors, online marketers, online business owners, and more, with bonuses offered to encourage bulk orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pat has created a Facebook group (with over 1,000 members) for those interested in being part of his &amp;ldquo;book launch&amp;rdquo; team, who would buy the book and help to promote through various avenues, from written reviews to promotion through their own networks, with rewards and incentives for those who aid the launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To ensure a strong book launch, Pat&amp;rsquo;s team plans to promote through:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct ads on social media, Google, YouTube, Amazon, etc. to book-buying outlets and plans to offer pre-order bonuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongly incentivized promotion to email list and social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affiliate program with all professionals in Pat&amp;rsquo;s network who&amp;rsquo;ve agreed to assist in marketing the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcast tour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog tour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
