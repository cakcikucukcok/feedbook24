  <title>The Widow&#39;s Guide to Sex and Dating - Carole Radziwill</title>

Her husband, Charlie, is a renowned sexologist and writer. Equal parts Alfred Kinsey and Warren Beatty, Charlie is pompous yet charming, supportive yet unfaithful; he&#39;s a firm believer that sex and love can&#39;t coexist for long, and he does little to hide his affairs. Claire&#39;s life with Charlie is an always interesting if not deeply devoted one, until Charlie is struck dead one day on the sidewalk by a falling sculpture ... a Giacometti, no less!&lt;br&gt;Once a promising young writer, Claire had buried her ambitions to make room for Charlie&#39;s. After his death, she must reinvent herself. Over the course of a year, she sees a shrink (or two), visits an oracle, hires a &quot;botanomanist,&quot; enjoys an erotic interlude (or ten), eats too little, drinks too much, dates a hockey player, dates a billionaire, dates an actor (not any actor either, but the handsome movie star every woman in the world fantasizes about dating). As she grieves for Charlie and searches for herself, she comes to realize that she has an opportunity to find something bigger than she had before--maybe even, possibly, love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
