  <title>Mental  Utopia - Michael Clemons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From my experiences at the factory to my time in the military, as well as my history as a student at the University of Cincinnati (19791984) and the Community College Southern Nevada (20032004) and Cincinnati State Technical College (20062007), and as a reader of Futurist magazine and New Scientist magazine, I feel I must live a life of dedication to the evolution of not only the bourgeoisie of the Earth, but also of those who take it upon themselves to live the role of a leader and enlighten all societies to see that there are no born aristocrats, and that there are no guaranteed obstacles to people becoming leaders in not only their chosen field, but leaders in empiricist manner of thought for success in many areas of life. I chose to live a life of someone who wants to see that all societies are prepared for upkeep of Western-style societies, and not sophist enough to weigh their decisions about who has value to their or any society on race, flag, and religious icons/idols.
My book, Mental Utopia, will show how not to let those that adhere to the parochial, whatever social conduct that is, blind people to rational thought.
Those said to be rich arent guaranteed empiricists. Why should you believe the word of a person said to be an authority figure is guaranteed coming from an empirical, rational-minded person, by mere reason of that so-called authority having degrees or letters? Mental Utopia will offer a way to perpetual happiness.
Mental Utopia needs to be offered in high school and college/university curriculums the world over. I have enjoyed peace of mind for over thirty years because of the lessons I give to you in Mental Utopia." />
