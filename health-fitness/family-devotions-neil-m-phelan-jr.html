    	<p><strong>Devotional material has always been of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">immeasurable</i> value to Gods people. Spurgeons Morning and Evening has encouraged many a pilgrim as they prepared for their day and sought comfort on their pillow at night.

Another reason has given <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">equal</i> force to vent our hearts in written form. There was once a day when families gathered together to discuss religious topics. It was by those discussions, however brief and unstructured they may have been, that children became aware of their parents faith and ultimately, their God. Today, we live in a busy world. With computers, television, VCR''s, CD''s and a world of entertainment at our fingertips, this opportunity of teaching has become all but extinct. Gadgets, noise and electronics stifle familial communication. Granted, children may know that their parents believe in God because they go to church, yet, the dynamics of personal interactions between parent and child is all but lost. Thus, we come to this final reason for this collection of articles. To give the parent some short <i>meditations</i> to enjoy personally and ultimately share with their family and children.</strong></p><p><strong>Our homilies are, for the most part, a condensed version of messages delivered to our congregation. Surely, if they were given us by the Chief Shepherd for the feeding of the gathered flock, they will be beneficial to other sheep which are not of our immediate fold.
