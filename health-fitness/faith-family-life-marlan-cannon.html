  <title>Faith Family Life - Marlan Cannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes the best lessons in life are simple and basic. In this new book, author Marlan Cannon discusses his upbringing and uses those remembrances to apply simple but effective truths that will touch and bless the hearts of believers and non-believers alike. To those who are struggling and are grappling with issues surrounding their family, faith, and life, this book, written in the basic prose of a friend to another friend, will administer encouragement and enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Completely discarding the notion of &amp;ldquo;silver spoons,&amp;rdquo; Cannon shares lessons from his humble upbringings, attributes his current successes to them, and inspires and exhorts the reader through his life experiences. These recollections will cause the reader to decry the apparent demise of the nuclear family and to celebrate the impact that strong, healthy Christian families can have on society at large.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is recommended for those who wish to understand the impact that strong Christian families can have on the lives of their children. It is a clarion call to individuals and families to adopt these simple, profound, yet effective insights that will lead to victory in Christ and success in every area of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
