  <title>Inside My Heart - Robin McGraw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe we were put on this earth to enjoy lives of joy and abundance, and that is what I want for you and for me. It&#39;s not my intention to give people advice on how to solve their problems (I leave that to my husband). But I&#39;ve had my share of struggles over the years, and I know a thing or two about what has worked for me. I have chosen to be an active participant in my life rather than a spectator, and in so doing I have chosen how to be a woman, how to be a wife, and how to be a mother in ways that are uniquely my own. I offer the stories of these choices as evidence of the power of sheer determination, will, and faith in God.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve seen her on television with her husband, Dr. Phil. But now it&#39;s time for a heart-to-heart conversation with Robin McGraw. In &lt;em&gt;Inside My Heart&lt;/em&gt;, Robin speaks woman to woman, inspiring you to embrace and celebrate the many roles you play and encouraging you to make deliberate choices that lead to a richer, happier, and more meaningful life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She shares with you the life-changing moments of her childhood years, dating and marrying Dr. Phil McGraw, raising two sons, and asserting herself as a woman in a man&#39;s world to show you that you have the power to make choices in your life. In fact, she&#39;s convinced that you must choose to go after the life you want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a deep and abiding faith in God, Robin McGraw shares her story so you too can make choices that reflect your own heart&#39;s truest priorities and highest goals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
