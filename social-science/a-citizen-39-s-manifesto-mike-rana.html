  <title>A Citizen&#39;s Manifesto - Mike Rana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A Citizens Manifesto  the Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recent books published by the administrators, leaders and authors on the subjects that concern our country generally focus on a few burning issues or those which are popular for the time being. The problem with this specialised approach is that issues get constrained by the coverage scope of the book and the book fails to deal with the inter-related impact of issues. In contrast, the treatment of the majority of issues in the pages of one book, gives corrective action a reasonable chance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The book offers a coherent list of about two hundred such issues and complementing suggestions for shaking up our citizens from the materialistic slumber that they are currently in to some sort of awakening. Even if these ideas are simply kept at the back of mind while in the day to day living or at work place, the chances that we would be moving in the right direction are real. The complete list of these ideas is summarised in the last chapter &lt;i&gt;The Manifesto&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Relevance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is a simple book, not really recommended for reading by the historians, economists, sociologist or the Indian Administrative Services (I*S) officers who need a much heavier dose to satisfy their intellect ; in fact it should be banned for them. This book deals with ideas, emotions, and feelings and not with statistics, reports, tables, numbers or references and quotations. Those in the seats of power or in administration of the country generally are guided by their perception of the society by looking at it from their ivory towers. Reading this book from the viewpoint of a common citizen gives them the advantage of being closer to reality as seen by an average citizen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the citizens of India, for creating a big picture in mind of how the government is functioning, what are their constraints and how public can help. &lt;br&gt;For the governance of India including politicians, for understanding the need for going into grass root level issues of the nation &lt;br&gt;For the bright students, it provides material for improving grading and for the students in general it provides important material in simple and interesting form &lt;br&gt;For the citizens of other developing countries, what they can learn from the Indian experience; countries like Pakistan, Eastern Europe, South East Asia and Latin American countries.&lt;br&gt; For Western Countries to help them do business with India after making better informed decisions for a win-win situation. We expect a very large number of readers in England, South Africa, Canada and USA. &lt;br&gt;Even from the view point of a traveller to India or school students going in for interviews this book provides adequate information as well answers to discussion topics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unique Main Messages in the book &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;	Introducing a 4th wing Regulatory in the government for overseeing Legislative, Executive and Judiciary&lt;br&gt; 	Reducing the number of national parties to 5 and regional to 3 per state&lt;br&gt; 	Using media power to promote transparency and take over control &lt;br&gt; 	Limiting the progress and GDP in order to conserve natural resources and control inflation &lt;br&gt; 	Restructuring and revitalizing our cities and getting back to villages and Maha-Grams&lt;br&gt; 	Reduction of laws, but intensification of its enforcement&lt;br&gt; 	Delegating funds to Panchayati Raj level for empowerment of villages &lt;br&gt; 	Discarding the ills of religion and cricket, and managing these industries sternly&lt;br&gt; 	Getting away from reservations, subsidies, and policies that weaken the society &lt;br&gt; 	Engaging our enemies in knowledge warfare where we can excel, instead of military or physical warfare&lt;br&gt; 	Introducing compulsory army tenure and compulsory rural service by doctors &lt;br&gt; 	Installing a good leader and politician but when in opposition establishing a shadow government &lt;br&gt; 	Creating a real time intelligence correlation network (RICN) to tackle terrorism &lt;br&gt; 	Recoveri" />
