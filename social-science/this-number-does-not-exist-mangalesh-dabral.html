  <title>This Number Does Not Exist - Mangalesh Dabral</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attentive critique on contemporary reality&amp;#8212;modernity, capitalism, industrialization&amp;#8212;this first United States publication of Mangalesh Dabral, presented in bilingual English and Hindi, speaks for the dislocated, disillusioned people of our time. Juxtaposing the rugged Himalayan backdrop of Dabral&#39;s youth with his later migration in search of earning a livelihood, this collection explores the tense relationship between country and city. Speaking in the language of deep irony, these compassionate poems also depict the reality of diaspora among ordinary people and the middle class, underlining the big disillusionment of post-Independence India.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Song of the Dislocated&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;With a heavy heart we left&lt;br&gt;tore away from the ancestral home&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;mud slips behind us now&lt;br&gt;stones fall in a hail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;look back a bit brother&lt;br&gt;how the doors shut themselves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;behind each one of them&lt;br&gt;a room utterly forlorn &lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mangalesh Dabral &lt;/b&gt;was born in 1948 in the Tehri Garhwal district of the Himalayas.
