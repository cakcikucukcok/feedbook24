  <title>Conversations with William Gibson - Patrick A. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;After reading Neuromancer for the first time,&quot; literary scholar Larry McCaffery wrote, &quot;I knew I had seen the future of [science fiction] (and maybe of literature in general), and its name was William Gibson.&quot; McCaffery was right. Gibson&#39;s 1984 debut is one of the most celebrated SF novels of the last half century, and in a career spanning more than three decades, the American Canadian science fiction writer and reluctant futurist responsible for introducing &quot;cyberspace&quot; into the lexicon has published nine other novels. &lt;p&gt;Editor Patrick A. Smith draws the twenty-three interviews in this collection from a variety of media and sources--print and online journals and fanzines, academic journals, newspapers, blogs, and podcasts. Myriad topics include Gibson&#39;s childhood in the American South and his early adulthood in Canada, with travel in Europe; his chafing against the traditional SF mold, the origins of &quot;cyberspace,&quot; and the unintended consequences (for both the author and society) of changing the way we think about technology; the writing process and the reader&#39;s role in a new kind of fiction. Gibson (b. 1948) takes on branding and fashion, celebrity culture, social networking, the post-9/11 world, future uses of technology, and the isolation and alienation engendered by new ways of solving old problems. The conversations also provide overviews of his novels, short fiction, and nonfiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
