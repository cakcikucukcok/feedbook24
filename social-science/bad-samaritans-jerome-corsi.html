  <title>Bad Samaritans - Jerome Corsi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;“If we do not fight this battle now, the United States of America will most certainly descend into a form of paganism not seen since the darkest days of antiquity.” —Jerome Corsi&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Liberty in America has always depended upon one thing: a citizenry who believes in God. Our founding fathers understood that without faith in God, rights and morality could not last. Without religion, true freedom cannot long endure. So for those who seek to take those rights away, transferring the gifts given by God to the individual back to the control of a secularist state, belief in God is the first tie to be severed. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Since the 1920s, a battle has waged across America between radical leftists of the ACLU and those who would keep America true to its inception as “one nation, under God.” &lt;I&gt;Bad Samaritans&lt;/I&gt; is best-selling author Jerome Corsi’s explosive look into the history of ACLU and its radical agenda to separate America from its religious roots and remake our nation in its own atheistic image. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Told in a straightforward, no-nonsense style, Corsi lays out the history of this struggle, its communist roots, and the court cases that are serving to slowly erode the foundations of our freedom. Today we see the fruits of the ACLU’s master plan—a culture flooded with pornography, placing little worth on the value of a human life, and one in which protection and special treatment seem to exist for everyone except those of a Judeo-Christian background.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Bad Samaritans&lt;/I&gt; looks behind the headlines and shows the ACLU’s fingerprints as it works to destroy freedom and enslave our constitutional republic to the demands of a Marxist state. It’s time to fight back.&lt;/P&gt;" />
