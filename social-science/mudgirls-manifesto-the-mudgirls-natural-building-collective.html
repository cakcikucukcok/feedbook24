  <title>Mudgirls Manifesto - The Mudgirls Natural Building Collective</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the face of widespread burnout and a world gone crazy, how to we find things to say &quot;yes&quot; to, rather than a resounding &quot;no&quot;? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On North America&#39;s West Coast, there&#39;s a group of rebel women who ten years ago chose to break free from a rigged economic and social system. They didn&#39;t take to the streets to lobby banks and governments to change their ways – they didn&#39;t have time for that. They had babies to feed and house. They reckoned that if nobody else was going to change the rules to support basic human needs and respect the biosphere, then we are all free to make our own rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They chose action. They decided to teach themselves how to build houses using the most abundant material on earth – mud. They&#39;d learn by building, gathering skills and allies. They&#39;d have fun, sharing whatever they learned with whoever wanted to come along for the ride. The Mudgirls revolution was born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part story of rebel women, grassroots self-governance, and community-building, part incendiary political and economic tract, and part practical guide to building natural homes for real people. &lt;em&gt;Mudgirls Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; is about respecting the earth, each other, and crafting meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A powerful, positive antidote to troubled times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Mudgirls&lt;/strong&gt; is an all-women&#39;s natural building collective from coastal British Columbia. They build houses and offer workshops that empower people to take back the right to provide themselves with shelter. They champion respect for the earth and each other.
