  <title>The ABCs of Autism Acceptance - Sparrow R Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sparrow Rose Jones is probably best known for their blog, Unstrange&lt;br /&gt; Mind: Remapping My World, and their previous book, No You Don&amp;rsquo;t: Essays&lt;br /&gt; from an Unstrange Mind, both of which deftly narrate their examination of&lt;br /&gt; themself, their identity as an Autistic person, and the changing state of access&lt;br /&gt; and civil rights for Autistic people. Their essays have covered everything&lt;br /&gt; from famous civil rights and criminal cases in the media to sexuality and&lt;br /&gt; relationships, life skills, coping mechanisms, and personal introspection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The ABCs of Autism Acceptance&lt;/em&gt;, Sparrow takes us through a guided tour&lt;br /&gt; of the topics most central to changing the way that autism is perceived, to&lt;br /&gt; remove systemic barriers to access that have traditionally been barriers to&lt;br /&gt; Autistic participation in some sectors of society. They also take us through the&lt;br /&gt; basics of Autistic culture, discussing many of its major features and recent&lt;br /&gt; developments with a sense of history and making the current state of the&lt;br /&gt; conversation around this form of neurodivergence clear to those who are new to&lt;br /&gt; it, whether they are Autistic themselves or a friend/family member looking for&lt;br /&gt; resources to help themselves support the Autistic people in their lives more fully.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it is impossible to capture the full scope and diversity of Autistic&lt;br /&gt; communities&amp;mdash;and there are many of them out there&amp;mdash;this book does serve as&lt;br /&gt; an important conversation starter, a primer, and a humble guide to the world.&lt;br /&gt; In these 26 short essays, you will find most of the topics most often blogged about&lt;br /&gt; by Actually Autistic authors, including footnotes, resources, and references&lt;br /&gt; to other writers whose works continue the conversations that start here.&lt;/p&gt;" />
