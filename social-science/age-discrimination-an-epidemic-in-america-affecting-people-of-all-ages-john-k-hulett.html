  <title>Age Discrimination: an Epidemic in America Affecting People of All Ages - John K. Hulett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Provocative New Book Examines Economys Effects on Older Workers
John K. Hulett Highlights Age Discrimination and Challenges Finding a Job in Middle
Age MINNEAPOLIS  American jobs are vanishing at a rapid rate in todays dismal
economy. Job bias claims have been hitting record highs while jobless markets continue
to flood the nation, forcing millions into unemployment and underemployment. John K.
Hulett seeks to draw attention to age discrimination in the workplace and how the current
shortage of jobs is affecting older job-seekers in his comprehensive new book, AGE
DISCRIMINATION: AN EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA AFFECTING PEOPLE OF ALL
AGES (published by AuthorHouse). Experience and wisdom are two qualities that come
with age and they cannot be purchased or degreed, gifted nor substituted for youth, greed,
and ignorance, Hulett writes.
AGE DISCRIMINATION: AN EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA chronicles five failed
investigations prompted by Huletts lawsuit claiming age discrimination. Hulett details
how the government participated in these investigations and how large corporations are
protected from employee claims because of their close relationships with many
government agencies. He also thoroughly examines the correlation between todays deep
recession and age discrimination.
