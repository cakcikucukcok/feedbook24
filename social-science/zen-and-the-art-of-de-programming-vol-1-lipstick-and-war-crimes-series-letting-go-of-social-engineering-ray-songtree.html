  <title>Zen and the Art of De-programming  (Vol.1, Lipstick and War Crimes Series): Letting Go of Social Engineering - Ray Songtree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vol . 1 of the Lipstick and War Crimes Series - the Zen edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of De-programming : Letting go of Social Engineering&lt;/em&gt; is the Zen edition of Vol. 1 from the&lt;em&gt; Lipstick and War Crimes Book Series&lt;/em&gt; by Ray Songtree, with an introduction that gives the Buddhist perspective. The author was friends with Kobun Chino Roshi, the sensei of Steve Jobs. Additionally, the introductions to the Christian and Indigenous editions are included. Vol 1. introduces us to the mind boggling reality of gender sculpting, using some of the female icons of the last 70 years. From Gloria Steinem to Beyonc&amp;eacute; and Miley Cyrus, we discover who was behind the creation of our values and why. What we thought was creative talent ends up being an intentional program to shape our idea of normal.&amp;nbsp; How do we de-program from this?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The true history of Marilyn Monroe, Katherine Hepburn, Gloria Steinem, Madonna, Shirley McClain, Miley Cyrus, Beyonc&amp;eacute; Knowles, Angelina Jolie,&amp;nbsp; Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Jane Fonda, Alice Walker and more, comes to light in this expos&amp;eacute; on feminism and our scripted ideas of gender and blurred gender.&amp;nbsp; Henry Kissinger, Barack Obama, and Warren Beatty come onstage to show us the male side of the program.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are all slowly waking up to the fact we have been socially engineered our entire lives. Men will learn just as much women from this fascinating but rather shocking history of who we think we are.&amp;nbsp; Though we can grasp that history might have been distorted in schools, it is more difficult to imagine that our values have been programmed by an organized media and that celebrities are created for that purpose. We usually take our values for granted. Now you won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lipstick refers to exaggerated feminine energy, and war crimes refers to exaggerated male energy. Vol. 1 is replete with over 100 color images and 50 references for your wondering mind.&amp;nbsp; It includes a 20 page photo essay that introduces the larger Series and a bio about the author.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The celebrity expos&amp;eacute;s, combined with the deep discussion of values, will interest readers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
