  <title>The Bow and the Club - Julius Evola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bow and the Club&lt;/em&gt; stands in many ways as the culmination of an exceptional life of deep study, meditation, and experience. This volume, first published in 1968 by Traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola, includes the author&amp;rsquo;s final and most concentrated statements on some of the great themes of his career, and must be regarded both by the student of Evola and by the newcomer to his ideas as an indispensable work from the hand of one of the profoundest and most challenging thinkers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this brilliant series of dense and beautiful essays, Evola lays bare the illness of his day, and suggests a way forward for those who are willing and able to pursue it. The issues he treats are various and diverse&amp;mdash;from East to West, from initiation to sex, from Black America to Hyperborean Rome, from &amp;lsquo;the evasive man&amp;rsquo; to skiing&amp;mdash;but the theme is constant: the urgent necessity to come to grips with the fatal decadence of an age, and to rise to the challenge it represents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
