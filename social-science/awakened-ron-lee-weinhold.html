  <title>Awakened ! - Ron Lee Weinhold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book attempts to present what I believe is a serious threat to our Constitutional Republic, based on the current administrations increasing imposition of Federal regulations, policies, and programs that infringe on the basic rights of the American citizens.  It is partly my personal story of growing up in this great country and making a positive contribution to society, but it is also a call for Americans to wake up to the reality of the continued overreach of the Federal Government regarding decisions that should rightfully be made by private citizens.  My goal is to encourage people to become personally informed and take action to end thus trend of intrusive government and return to the principles of our founders.  It is not a call for an all out revolution or engaging in violence against the government.  Rather, it is a call for a constructive engagement by the folks out here in the working trenches to wake up, stand up, speak out, and then act in a civil manner to bring positive change through positive ideas that are based on the values that have been cultivated and promulgated since the founding of the country.  Finally, I hope to begin to restore our countrys reputation of American Exceptionalism that has been tarnished under the current administration.  This is a promise I have made to myself and a legacy I want to leave my family, friends, and all people of good will." />
