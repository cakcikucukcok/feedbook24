  <title>An Education in Politics - Dave Mulder, Frank B. Wood Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave Mulder comes from an academic background, and his experience in the world of politics has been insightful. He has many timely observations as to how to strengthen the political system.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Tom Osborne,&lt;br&gt;
Athletic Director, University of Nebraska, Lincoln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its refreshing to see two Legislators from two opposite parties, both of great character and high moral values, who can work and cooperate together on issues important to Iowa and not just vote the party line, which in many cases truly fails the purpose of good law-making for the betterment of the great state of Iowa.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Bernie Saggau,&lt;br&gt;
Retired Executive Secretary of the Iowa High School Athletic Assoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave and Franks informative, lively discussion of their years in the Iowa Senate is a must read for anyone who wants to serve in an elected office. Their political philosophies, including faith-based life lessons, give readers, educators, and students a unique in-depth perspective on grass roots politics. It is my privilege to edit this book.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
