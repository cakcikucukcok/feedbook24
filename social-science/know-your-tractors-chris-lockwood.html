  <title>Know Your Tractors - Chris Lockwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chris has tried to show the tractors carrying out a wide range of tasks. His concise text explains what is going on in the pictures. He includes some basic technical specifications such as power outputs so that the reader can roughly compare different tractors and have an idea of the size and capability of each. The 41 tractors chosen come from 25 marques. Many of the tractor manufacturers have parent companies, some of which own a number of tractor makers. Chris gives these details as well as the country of assembly and/or manufacture. Tractor enthusiasts will enjoy this book, but it is particularly designed to be an introduction for visitors to rural shows, farm parks and country bookshops. Chris Lockwood comes from an East Anglian farming family. He has over 100,000 images of tractors at work, the basis of his highly popular website: suffolkagriphotos." />
