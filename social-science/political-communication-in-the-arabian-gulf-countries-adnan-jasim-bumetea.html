  <title>Political Communication in the Arabian Gulf Countries - Adnan Jasim Bumetea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book represents the first systematic study of aspects of political communication in the Arabian Gulf region, one of the most important areas in the Middle East. It explores the relationship between the governments and the press, first through an examination of international and national political news coverage in the Gulf press, and second through an analysis of factors influencing selection of these news stories. The research examines one principal Arabic-language newspaper from each of the six Arabian Gulf countries: Al-Ayam (Bahrain), Al-Rai Al-Aam (Kuwait), Oman (Oman), Al-Sharq (Qatar), Al-Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), and Al-Bayan (UAE). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The analysis shows a culturally specific pattern of media model, distinct from that in the West or other areas in the world. This pattern can be understood through three government-press models. First, the loyalist press model prevailing in Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in which a high level of government influence is seen, and the press is supportive and in line of the government. Second, the diverse press model, which exists in Kuwait and is characterized by a press with relative freedom and diversity. Third, the transitional press model, which describes the condition in Bahrain manifested with a mixed system of governmental control and elements of press freedom.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As this pattern still exists, this book is important for decision makers, politicians, media communicators, research centers, journalism schools, media investors and newspapers industry to understand the media industry in this strategic area in the world." />
