  <title>New and Improved - John C. Spurlock, Cynthia Magistro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the Victorian era drew to a close, American culture experienced a vast transformation. In many ways, the culture changed even more rapidly and profoundly for women.  The &quot;new woman,&quot; the &quot;new freedom,&quot; and the &quot;sexual revolution&quot; all referred to women moving out of the Victorian home and into the public realm that men had long claimed as their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Modern middle-class women made a distinction between emotional styles that they considered Victorian and those they considered modern. They expected fulfillment in marriage, companionship, and career, and actively sought up-to-date versions of love and happiness, relieved that they lived in an age free from taboo and prudery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing on the diaries, letters, and memoirs of women from a wide range of backgrounds and geographic regions, this volume offers insights into middle-class women&#39;s experiences of American culture in this age of transition.  It documents the ways in which that culture--including new technologies, advertising, and movies--shaped women&#39;s emotional lives and how these women appropriated the new messages and ideals. In addition, the authors describe the difficulties that women encountered when emotional experiences failed to match cultural expectations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
