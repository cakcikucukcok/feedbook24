  <title>On the Wrong Track - Ivan Pavell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Various opinion polls, both in the USA and Great Britain have revealed that a large proportion of citizens believe that their countries are heading in the wrong direction. 
The book generally describes the trends in the governance of the West that have been gradually changing Individualistic free societies to Collectivist societies of subservient people. This progression has been carried out by the so called Political elite. 
In practical terms we can see  that there has been a growth of governments and their bureaucracies, as well as an encroachment of governments influence on what used to be citizens individual decision. This occurrence has driven the attempt to manage entire societies.
Examples can be noted in relation to: management of the economy, social engineering, the use of media and education to impose collectivist ideologies, extensive surveillance of citizens, and the general aggrandizement of governments and their rulers. These have all lead to the transformation of free individuals into subjects of the State (that is ruling elite) 
Alongside this transformation, the governments in the West are currently living beyond their means and are accruing enormous debts. 
The book compares the present Statism of the West with the Soviet Socialism, and how they are gradually drawing closer." />
