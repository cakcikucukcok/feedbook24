  <title>Protest Movements and Parties of the Left - David J. Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How successful are social movements and left parties at achieving social and political change? How, if at all, can movements and parties work together to challenge existing hierarchies? Is the political left witnessing a revival in contemporary politics? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book highlights some of the key achievements of left parties and protest movements in their goal of challenging different types of inequality &amp;ndash; and considers the ways in which their challenge to authority and power could be intensified. It combines new theoretical ideas with rich empirical detail on the debates and concrete activities undertaken by left parties and protest movements over a broad historical period, from the early European labour movement to the recent anti-austerity global protests. The book will offer unique insight into the broad history and theory of emancipatory politics; as well as making an important contribution to ongoing debates between left-leaning academics, researchers and activists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
