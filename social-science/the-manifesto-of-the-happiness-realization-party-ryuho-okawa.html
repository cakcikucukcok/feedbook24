  <title>The Manifesto of the Happiness Realization Party - Ryuho Okawa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy Science, a new religion representing modern-day Japan, is working to realize &quot;the happiness that carries over from this world to the next.&quot; Not only is Happy Science helping people return to Heaven after death, but it is also trying to make this world, a training ground for the soul, a place where people can live shining brightly. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;In order to strongly promote the creation of such a world, Master Ryuho Okawa of Happy Science established the Happiness Realization Party in May 2009, a new political party to take on that task. This book is the declaration of the establishment of HRP by Master Okawa. The title of this book may remind you of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Communist Manifesto &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; which was written by Karl Marx back in 1848. In &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The Manifesto of the Happiness Realization Party&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, the author states the following: &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&quot;As a result of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Communist Manifesto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, humanity suffered for a period of over 150 years. Ultimately, this became an experiment on civilization that brought about the creation of materialist nations, and thus &#39;Manifesto of the Happiness Realization Party&#39; is aiming to achieve the opposite of this. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;The &#39;Manifesto of the Happiness Realization Party&#39; declares, &#39;We shall mobilize the capacities of people who recognize the existence of God and Buddha and believe in the correct Buddha&#39;s Truth, and work to build a worldly, realistic utopia. We shall make Japan a starting point for our political activities, and have an impact on people throughout the whole world. We intend to bring about a simultaneous global revolution in the correct sense.&#39;&quot; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;This book is a historical declaration to change the world through a peaceful revolution by the philosophy and speech based on the Truth, rather than by violence or massacre. The book states the political issues of modern-day Japan, which is the birthplace of such revolution; it also states on the assessment of the meaning of WW II as well as how the relation between religion and politics should be. It is a must read for all people who wish to build a true utopia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />
