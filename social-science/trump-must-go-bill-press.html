  <title>Trump Must Go - Bill Press</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would give myself an A+&quot; --Donald Trump, on his first 100 days in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Americans increasingly agree on one thing: Every day that Trump stays in office, he diminishes the United States and its people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Trump Must Go&lt;/i&gt;, TV and radio host Bill Press offers 100 reasons why Trump needs to be removed from office, whether by impeachment, the 25th Amendment, or the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning with the man himself and moving through Trump&#39;s executive action damage, Press covers Trump&#39;s debasement of the United States political system and degrading of the American presidency. Ranging from banning federal employees&#39; use of the phrase &quot;climate change,&quot; to putting down Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations as &quot;shithole&quot; countries, we have to wonder what he&#39;ll do next. He has a bromance with Putin that enables several meetings between Trump staffers and Russian officials, and he has a wrecking crew administration: Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and Housing Secretary Ben Carson, to name a few. Extensive &quot;executive time&quot; marks Trump&#39;s calendar so he can golf, watch TV, and eat fast food. Trump has done it all...badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, in a political climate where the world has learned to expect the unexpected, Press offers readers a twist: one reason not to ditch Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;" />
