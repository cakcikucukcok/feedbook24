  <title>From Sheets to Suits - John Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Racism refers to a host of practices, beliefs, social relations, and phenomena that work to reproduce a racial hierarchy and social structure that yield superiority and privilege for some, and discrimination and oppression for others. The practices of a White American-led society have not only perpetuated these practices, but deeply embedded unlawful and discriminatory racial policies that affect the everyday way, for all citizens of the United States, and in particular, African Americans. 
From Sheets to Suits: Embedded Racism in American Society is without a doubt a controversial examination of the beginnings of racism in this country, originating with the Ku Klux Klan and reaching a pinnacle in the summer of 2014 with the shooting of Michael Brown Jr., an unarmed African American teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. 
St. Louis, Missouri, is the one of the most covertly racist cities in the United States. Many of the White Americans in the Gateway City are ignorant, dont like to be around African American people, dont believe black people can be educated and go out of their way to prevent African Americans from succeeding. Law enforcement agencies have even gone as far as to intentionally target African Americans in sinister revenue scandals. 
Parker examines the forms taken by embedded racism in politics and entertainment, in educational institutions and in everyday encounters. Readers are made to feel the humiliations and hostility encountered by African American people in what remains, to a shocking degree, an embedded racist society.
This book delves into how racism has affected, and has had a hand in shaping every aspect of the society in the United States." />
