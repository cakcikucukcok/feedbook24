  <title>Guided by the Mountains - Michael Lerma, Avery Denny, Robert Yazzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do traditional Indigenous institutions of governance offer to our understanding of the contemporary challenges faced by the Navajo Nation today and tomorrow? &lt;em&gt;Guided by the Mountains&lt;/em&gt; looks at the tensions between Indigenous political philosophy and the challenges faced by Indigenous nations in building political institutions that address contemporary problems and enact &quot;good governance.&quot; Specifically, it looks at Navajo, or Din&amp;#233;, political thought, focusing on traditional Din&amp;#233; institutions that offer &quot;a new (old) understanding of contemporary governance challenges&quot; facing the Navajo Nation.
Arguing not only for the existence but also the persistence of traditional Navajo political thought and policy, &lt;em&gt;Guided by the Mountains&lt;/em&gt; asserts that &quot;traditional&quot; Indigenous philosophy provides a model for creating effective governance institutions that address current issues faced by Indigenous nations. Incorporating both visual interpretations and narrative accounts of traditional and contemporary Din&amp;#233; institutions of government from Din&amp;#233; philosophers, the book is the first to represent Indigenous philosophy as the foundation behind traditional and contemporary governance. It also explains how Din&amp;#233; governance institutions operated during Pre-Contact and Post-Contact times. This path-breaking book stands as the first-time normative account of Din&amp;#233; philosophy." />
