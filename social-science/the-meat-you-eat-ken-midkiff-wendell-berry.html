  <title>The Meat You Eat - Ken Midkiff, Wendell Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have given up to the agribusiness corporations a crucial part of our responsibility as human beings and we must now think of ways to take it back.&quot;&lt;br&gt;- Wendell Berry, from the Foreword&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this eye-opening book, Sierra Club Director Ken Midkiff exposes the dangers posed by corporate control of agriculture (agribusiness)--to our health, and to the health of the nation&#39;s economy, security, and the environment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Meat You Eat&lt;/i&gt; explores the current practices of the corporations taking over the raising and slaughtering of farm animals (and farmed fish, such as salmon). These companies use a model that has transformed livestock farming from quality-driven family-owned operations into big businesses concerned with volume, efficiency, uniformity, and profits above all. Midkiff reveals the true cost of agribusiness on all levels-environmental, financial, moral, legal, and medical-balancing startling truths with practical solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than advocate a vegan or vegetarian diet, Midkiff argues that using and supporting local farmers will improve the quality of life for us all, as well as for the animals whose meat we eat. Complete with resource sections about where to find local farmers and lists of agribusiness culprits, the book encourages us to take an active interest in what we put on our plates and in our mouths, and use the power of our pocketbooks to make it clear that our health, our environment, and our communities are of vital importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a foreword by Wendell Berry, hailed by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Books Review&lt;/i&gt; as the &quot;great moral essayist of our day,&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Meat You Eat&lt;/i&gt; is an informative and ringing call to arms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
