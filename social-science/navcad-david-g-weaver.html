  <title>Navcad - David G. Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WWII - 1942 - Coastal South Carolina
Twenty year old Bruce Weber is arrested, accused of running bootleg whiskey in his souped up hot rod.
He is given the option of going to jail or enlisting in the V-5 US Naval Aviation Cadet Program (that does not allow cadets to drive) by a local judge. Bruce elects the latter and is sent to Pre-Flight School at the Univ. of GA, to St.Louis MO for primary training and to Pensacola for Final Squadron. During Cadet Training, Bruces experiences many dramatic -- sometimes dangerous, sometimes trying, often humorous - incidents and a few romantic interludes. Although he demonstrates exceptional flying ability and leadership that gains the admiration of fellow cadets and his flight instructors, he has a short temper and has difficulty with regulations. Nearing completion of flight training, Bruce is deeply concerned because he is in danger of washing-out due to accumulated demerits." />
