  <title>&quot;We the Sheeple&quot; - Ken Braun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Federal government, through criminal intent on behalf of the tyrannical owners of the Federal Reserve, alongside faulty regulation contrived by Congressional greed, and the endemic weakness of corruption, caused the economic collapse of 2008 by creating conditions favorable to the rampant spending, exorbitant debt, greed, and immoral monetary manipulation by those participatory in the global fi nancial system. The elite controlled media aided and abetted every step of the toxic downfall, since 1976, when this grandiose plan began unfolding under the hapless Jimmy Carter (Obama I). The global takeover was planned about 100 years ago, and it took two depressions and two world wars for the establishments plan to materialize. In 2010, Chairman Comrade Obama and his arrogant Comrades (referred to as our elected Congress) are preparing to shove the banking cakes illegal frosting rudely down the already dry throats of the American people. If the sheeple have any thought process remaining after the 100-year onslaught of American miss-education they will choke and choke mightily on this poisonous frosting. The vacuous, though vociferous public thrashing by our cowardly Congress and the deceitful White House of the big international banks is nothing more than cheap seat entertainment for the uninformed American voter. The practical purpose of financial reform under the guise of protecting the taxpayer is to transfer all banking risk to the fatuous taxpayer forever, along with creating a governmental machine to be used for legally crushing unwanted competition for the international financial elite. You might say, without exaggeration, that Obamas financial reform, and other Marxist policies are the final nails in your American freedom coffi n. It is the end of the American Dream.&lt;/p&gt;" />
