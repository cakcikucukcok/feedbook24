  <title>The Limits of Power - Andrew J. Bacevich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From an acclaimed conservative historian and former military officer, a bracing call for a pragmatic confrontation with the nation&#39;s problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Limits of Power &lt;/i&gt;identifies a profound triple crisis facing America: the economy, in remarkable disarray, can no longer be fixed by relying on expansion abroad; the government, transformed by an imperial presidency, is a democracy in form only; U.S. involvement in endless wars, driven by a deep infatuation with military power, has been a catastrophe for the body politic. These pressing problems threaten all of us, Republicans and Democrats. If the nation is to solve its predicament, it will need the revival of a distinctly American approach: the neglected tradition of realism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew J. Bacevich, uniquely respected across the political spectrum, offers a historical perspective on the illusions that have governed American policy since 1945. The realism he proposes includes respect for power and its limits; sensitivity to unintended consequences; aversion to claims of exceptionalism; skepticism of easy solutions, especially those involving force; and a conviction that the books will have to balance. Only a return to such principles, Bacevich argues, can provide common ground for fixing America&#39;s urgent problems before the damage becomes irreparable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
