  <title>A Happy And Eternal Life Thanks To A Good Governance - Anonimo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ideal state. Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t dreamt of it, at least once? It&amp;rsquo;s a fleeting thought drowning in the swamp of politics, in that turbid water, unable to be something more than a longing sigh. &lt;i&gt;Anonimo&lt;/i&gt; manages to create that kind of thought, to give it shape, content, significance, reality. This book, set in a not-too-far future, deals with the nascence of the Demotelematocracy, an innovative form of government based on the active participation of the citizens-voters through polls, referendums, popular-initiative laws, elections and protests. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of democracy, &amp;ldquo;strengthened&amp;rdquo; and guaranteed by technology, by the new means of communication and, above all, by the &amp;ldquo;Eye,&amp;rdquo; a revolutionary audio and video surveillance system. All of this, however, rests on the Shared Common Sense, namely the deep and universal sharing of the same values and morals. Superficial? Demagogic? Utopian? Maybe, but this book provides some interesting starting points to hope concretely in a different and better future. The dialogues help the reader familiarise with the text, allowing him or her to ask and to answer questions. Finally a constructive and useful read. An interesting voice in an ocean of empty words." />
