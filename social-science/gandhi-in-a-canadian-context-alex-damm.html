  <title>Gandhi in a Canadian Context - Alex Damm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gandhi in a Canadian Context examines a range of intriguing and under-studied connections between India’s greatest nationalist leader, Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948), and facets of life in Canada, including Gandhi’s interest in and contact with Canada and Canadians early in the twentieth century, and the implications of Gandhi’s thinking on a range of issues in Canadian society today. This collection of essays by Canadian scholars explores topics such as Gandhi’s awareness of Canada; the academic study of Gandhi in Canadian higher education; and dimensions of Gandhi’s thought that demand greater attention and have enduring relevance for individuals and communities in Canada. These range from a peace-oriented Islam and participation in direct action campaigns to a more constructive politics and environmental stewardship. This book breaks new ground in the depth of its study of a figure significant for both Canada and the world at large. The themes in this book will be of interest to scholars in Gandhi studies, education, Canadian history, and sociology, as well as to the general reader who seeks to reflect on what traditions of non-violence and conflict resolution championed by Gandhi might contribute to social progress in Canada." />
