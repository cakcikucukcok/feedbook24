  <title>Why Turkey is Authoritarian - Halil Karaveli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the last century, the Western world has regarded Turkey as a pivotal case of the &#39;clash of civilisations&#39; between Islam and the West. Why Turkey is Authoritarian offers a radical challenge to this conventional narrative. Halil Karaveli highlights the danger in viewing events in Turkey as a war between a &#39;westernising&#39; state and the popular masses defending their culture and religion, arguing instead for a class analysis that is largely ignored in the Turkish context. *BR**BR*This book goes beyond cultural categories that overshadow more complex realities when thinking about the &#39;Muslim world&#39;, while highlighting the ways in which these cultural prejudices have informed ideological positions. Karaveli argues that Turkey&#39;s culture and identity have disabled the Left, which has largely been unable to transcend these divisions. *BR**BR*This book asks the crucial question: why does democracy continue to elude Turkey? Ultimately, Karaveli argues that Turkish history is instructive for a left that faces the global challenge of a rising populist right, which succeeds in mobilising culture and identity to its own purposes.*BR**BR*Published in partnership with the Left Book Club." />
