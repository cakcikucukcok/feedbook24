  <title>Christians and Cultural Difference - David I. Smith, Pennylyn Dykstra-Pruim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Encountering cultural differences in the classroom, in the workplace, in the church, and in the public square is an everyday part of contemporary life. The chances that we will live our lives interacting only with those who share our cultural identity and ways of thinking are shrinking. Understanding culture and how cultural difference affects how we understand one another and live well together is no longer just for travelers. It has become a basic life skill.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Past Christian ways of thinking about cultural difference as most important for missions to far away places do not harmonize with today&amp;#39;s realities. This book offers a brief, critical overview of how Christians have been rethinking their relationship to cultural difference. Creation and fall, the image of God, the body/temple that is the church, neighbor ethics, the trinity, the incarnation and cross of Christ, and the call to welcome strangers &amp;ndash; each of these offers distinct challenges to think in Christian ways about how we deal with differences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Exploring the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches, this book provides a concise guide to current Christian discussions of otherness. It points to rich ways in which Christians can responsibly and graciously embrace cultural difference.&lt;/p&gt;" />
