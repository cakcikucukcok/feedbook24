  <title>A Simple Love Story Between Me and Myself - Melisa Mel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Simple Love Story between Me and Myself is the story of Mel, a person who struggles through life with gender dysphoria but eventually finds her peace with herself. The story gives hope to those who are struggling within themselves while simultaneously bringing insight to those who do not understand how difficult this personal struggle can be. 
Having experienced this struggle first hand, Melisa Mel had no trouble choosing the main character for this story. It is the story of herself and the years it took for her to come to terms with being a woman while all the time feeling she should have been a man. 
One of Melisa Mels favorite quotes is Be who you be. Her brother, Keith Gabriel, said this to her many years ago and the words have come to mean a lot to this author. She has quoted him various times in her publications, including this one. 
Melisa Mel feels that there is no reason that we cannot ALL Be who we be. She states, There is ample room for everyone and everything on this lovely planet we all share. How we share the space is up to each and every one of us. There is no reason we cant make it work peacefully if we choose to do so. 
This story is appropriate for all ages and all peoples. Enjoy!" />
