  <title>Scandalize My Name - Terrion L. Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From sapphire, mammy, and jezebel, to the angry black woman, baby mama, and nappy-headed ho, black female iconography has had a long and tortured history in public culture. The telling of this history has long occupied the work of black female theorists--much of which has been foundational in situating black women within the matrix of sociopolitical thought and practice in the United States. &lt;em&gt;Scandalize My Name&lt;/em&gt; builds upon the rich tradition of this work while approaching the study of black female representation as an opening onto a critical contemplation of the vagaries of black social life. It makes a case for a radical black subject-position that structures and is structured by an intramural social order that revels in the underside of the stereotype and ultimately destabilizes the very notion of &quot;civil society.&quot;
At turns memoir, sociological inquiry, literary analysis, and cultural critique, &lt;em&gt;Scandalize My Name &lt;/em&gt;explores topics as varied as serial murder, reality television, Christian evangelism, teenage pregnancy, and the work of Toni Morrison to advance black feminist practice as a mode through which black sociality is both theorized and made material." />
