  <title>Without Child: Challenging the Stigma of Childlessness - Laurie Lisle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Without Child&lt;/i&gt; challenges the stigma of childlessness by offering childless women the lifeaffirming story of themselves. Beginning with the difficult inner journey a woman faces before finally deciding or realizing she will not bear children, &lt;i&gt;Without Child&lt;/i&gt; explores the myth of the childless woman&#39;s rejection of the maternal instinct. It also examines the childless woman&#39;s relationship to mothers and mothering, to her femininity, to men, to achievement, to her body,and to old age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laurie Lisle contends that childless women are part of an ancient and respectable cultural tradition that includes biblical matriarchs, celibate saints, and nineteenth-century social reformers. However, like other aspects of women&#39;s history, this tradition has been forgotten and, in the process, maligned. &lt;i&gt;Without Child&lt;/i&gt; bring childless women out of obscurity and places them back in women&#39;s history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Without Child&lt;/i&gt; brings scope and depth to a subject that has long been misunderstood. Weaving rich materials from history, literature, religion, and sociology with the author&#39;s own and other stories, this groundbreaking book does what no other has done before-presents childlessnessin a multifaceted and positive light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most women grow up thinking they will become mothers, and many do follow that path. But for those women who are willingly or unwillingly without children, childlessness is a way of life that many of them must constantly defend. &lt;i&gt;Without Child&lt;/i&gt; explores the facts and fallacies behind childlessness,what it means for women and society, and reminds us of how women can and do embrace this choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the shadow of a culture that claims to adore the child, &lt;i&gt;Without Child&lt;/i&gt; bring a long forbidden topic into the light. Wide-ranging, yet intimate, philosophical, yet clear~sighted, this important book will reassure millions of women that they are not alone, not unusual, and, in fact, are part of a long and honorable tradition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laurie Lisle&lt;/b&gt; is the author of four other books besides&lt;i&gt;Without Child&lt;/i&gt;: two biographies of women artists, a history of a girls&#39;school, and a memoir from the point-of-view as a gardener. Raised in Rhode Island, she lives with her husband in Litchfield County,Connecticut and in Westchester County, New York.
