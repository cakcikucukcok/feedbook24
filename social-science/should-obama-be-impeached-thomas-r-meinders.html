  <title>&quot;Should Obama Be Impeached?&quot; - Thomas R. Meinders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Should Obama Be Impeached? The United States of America is currently in three wars. What the American people would like to know is why we engaged in any of them since the President of the United States doesnt make a commitment to winning them. The President has stated that we would start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan within a few months. If we are going to withdraw the troops in a few months without any hope of winning the war it makes more sense to withdraw them immediately. The Taliban is just waiting for the troops to withdraw. The Taliban already knows that they have won the war. The President needs to make the commitment to win the war or get out now. This is a huge waste of the resources of the United States with no hope for a positive outcome. If the President is going to have a plan to win the war then he needs to discuss it with the Generals in charge. The President does not know who we are fighting or why. When Obama was asked who the rebels are in Libya there was complete silence. Why are we there when no one knows who we are supporting? Then the President has made comments that Gadhafi must go. Then in the next sentence Obama states that we will not target Gadhafi with the air strikes. The President can not have it both ways. Either eliminate Gadhafi and his leaders or forget about winning this war. When you cut off the head of the dog, the rest of the dog is going to stop functioning. This does not seem like a very hard decision to make. Get serious about winning or get out of the game." />
