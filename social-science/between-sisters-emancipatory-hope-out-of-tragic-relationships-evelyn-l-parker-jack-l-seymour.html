  <title>Between Sisters: Emancipatory Hope out of Tragic Relationships - Evelyn L. Parker, Jack L. Seymour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world laced with the lethal threads of racism, sexism, classism, and sexual oppression we need a liberating hope that dismantles these intersecting problems that render us into a stupor of chronic despair. In the United States, where the color of your skin can determine life or death, we need hope that will give us life abundantly. In a country where state laws prohibited mixed-race marriages between white and black people as recent as the year 2000 and black/white mixed-race children were demonized by both whites and blacks, our hope must be inspired by the Holy Spirit, God the Creator and Redeemer at work in the world today. This book offers emancipatory hope as this divine hope. With a focus on black/white mixed-race young women and their troubling relationships with women and girls of all ethnicities, Between Sisters provides a process toward emancipatory hope through forgiveness, femaleship, fortitude, and freedom. The process toward emancipatory hope challenges Christian churches to practice forgiveness, femaleship, fortitude, and freedom in a racist society. While the process is not without struggle, it promises that hope through the power of the Holy Spirit will someday usher in a society of justice, peace, and love." />
