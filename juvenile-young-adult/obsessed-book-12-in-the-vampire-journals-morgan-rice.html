  <title>Obsessed (Book #12 in the Vampire Journals) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A book to rival TWILIGHT and VAMPIRE DIARIES, and one that will have you wanting to keep reading until the very last page! If you are into adventure, love and vampires this book is the one for you!&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Vampirebooksite.com (regarding Turned) &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBSESSED is Book #12—and the final book—of the bestselling series THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS, which begins with TURNED (Book #1)--a free download with over 900 five star reviews! &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OBSESSED, 16 year old Scarlet Paine races to save her true love, Sage, before he is killed at the hand of the Immortalists. Alienated from her friends and family—and with only one night left before Sage is wiped out—Scarlet is forced to choose whether to sacrifice it all for him.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin and Caleb race desperately to save their daughter, still determined to find a way to cure Scarlet and to end vampirism for all time. Their quest leads them to one shocking secret after the next as they seek to find the ancient, lost vampire city, hidden deep beneath the Sphinx in Egypt. What they find may just change the destiny of the vampire race for all time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it may still be too late. The Immortalist nation is intent on killing Scarlet and Sage, while Kyle, too, is on a murderous rampage, turning Vivian and the entire high school into his own vampire army, set on destroying the town.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OBSESSED, the shocking finale of the 12 book series THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS, Scarlet and Caitlin will be left with a monumental choice—one that will change the world forever. Will Scarlet make the ultimate sacrifice to save Sage’s life? Will Caitlin give up everything to save her daughter? Will they both risk everything for love? &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Morgan Rice proves herself again to be an extremely talented storyteller….This would appeal to a wide range of audiences, including younger fans of the vampire/fantasy genre. It ended with an unexpected cliffhanger that leaves you shocked.”&lt;p&gt;–The Romance Reviews (regarding Loved)" />
