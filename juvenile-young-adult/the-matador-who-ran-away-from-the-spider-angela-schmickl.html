  <title>The Matador Who Ran Away From The Spider - Angela Schmickl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An original and funny story about Perreras who runs away from a spider. Perreras is used to fighting such huge bulls as a matador, however he is scared of a tiny spider! Perreras tells all his friends - Ana, the flamenco dancer, Pedro, his costume maker and Eduardo, an accountant, about &amp;quot;the big and hairy and VERY scary spider&amp;quot;. Ana, Pedro and Eduardo enter his house to help Perreras search for the cheeky spider.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Matador Who Ran Away From The Spider&amp;quot; is a fast-paced, good-natured rhyme that also describes what a matador is and the glorious costumes that he/she wears. The reader also sees Perreras enjoying the spotlight and the attention he gets from his fans. Bullfighting is a popular form of entertainment for the Spaniards to watch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Matador Who Ran Away From The Spider&amp;quot; is the first in a series of funny stories with an international twist that exposes the reader to other cultures and countries in a unique way. &amp;quot;After reading it at Kindy, Children laughed at Perreras and his antics,&amp;quot; said Sue, a preschool teacher. Watch out for the second in the series: &amp;quot;The Opera Singer Who Jumped Into His Dinner.&amp;quot;" />
