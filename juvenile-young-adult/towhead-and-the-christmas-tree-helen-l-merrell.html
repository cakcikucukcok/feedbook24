  <title>Towhead and the Christmas Tree - Helen L. Merrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Little boys can be such a mystery, so sweet and such a joy to watch grow up. Towhead lives on a farm. He has no children his own age to spend time with. He loves his pets and gets really excited when his mother rabbit has more babies. His goat named Nosy is always getting him into trouble with Mom because the goat wont stay out of her garden. His best friend and companion is his dog, Sami. He would be lost without Sami. This story shows the love that can exist between a boy and his dog. Towhead is raised in a loving Christian family. This could be a true story as I think back to the things my children got into at this age. He loves his mother dearly and feels neglected when she is busy with spring cleaning and doesnt have time for him. When he gets into trouble and realizes what he has done because of his rejection, it makes him realize he is misbehaving. Perhaps this is the beginning of Towhead growing up." />
