  <title>Friends Are Forever - Dianne A. Rhodes, Mazen Kharboutli, Abdullah Aldasuki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A chance meeting through an employment ad for a ghost writer brought together a Dubai engineer with a childlike heart; an inspirational writer from Detroit, Michigan, looking for work; and a gifted Syrian storyboard artistall for the common purpose of expressing universal themes of love and responsibility, forgiveness and peace, and friendship and trust.
With our second book, Friends Are Forever, Mazen has since moved from Dubai to the United States to be with family and has started his own construction business; Abdullah is now a permanent resident of Turkey where he is in partnership at a graphic and animation firm; and Dianne still resides in Detroit and has taken up baking for her grandchildren who can always find a cookie, a story, and a hug waiting for them at Nanas house.
 Friends Are Forever explores the lifelong bonds that can be formed when we open our hearts to let a forever friend come in. We sincerely hope our young readers enjoy the many life lessons we try to express through these stories as we share this wonderful world, together." />
