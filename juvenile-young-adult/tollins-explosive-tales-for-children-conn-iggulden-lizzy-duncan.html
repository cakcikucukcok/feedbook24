  <title>Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children - Conn Iggulden, Lizzy Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These are the first three stories of the Tollins. Yes, they do have wings, but no, they aren&#39;t fairies. Tollins are a lot less &lt;em&gt;fragile&lt;/em&gt; than fairies. In fact, the word fragile can&#39;t really be used to describe them at all. They are about as fragile as a house brick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;How to Blow Up Tollins&quot; a fireworks factory comes to the village of Chorleywood and the Tollins find themselves being used as industrial supplies. Being blasted into the night sky or spun round on a Catherine wheel is nowhere near a much fun as it sounds. It&#39;s up to one young Tollin to save his people from becoming an ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Sparkler and the Purple Death&quot; our hero looks execution in the face. Luckily, the executioner&#39;s mask in backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in &quot;Windbags and Dark Tollins&quot; Tollin society faces a threat from the Dorset countryside, which, again, is much more frightening and nail-bitingly dramatic than it actually sounds. &lt;/p&gt;" />

Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children was her first illustrated book.<br /><b><i>Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children: Iggulden, Conn ...</i></b> | So begins Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children. The book is divided into three stories: How to Blow Up Tollins, Sparkler and the Purple Death and Windbags and Dark Tollins. Each of these stories is in turn divided into chapters, making this an excellent read-aloud in classrooms or at home.<br /><b><i>Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children by Conn Iggulden</i></b> | In collaboration with illustrator Lizzy Duncan, Iggulden has created a rather charming children's book that is a not-so-secretly a paean to science and the industrial revolution, in a very English way. I enjoy the dry, subtly sarcastic humor Iggulden uses to describe the Tollins, and their home of Chorleywood.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Tollins: Explosive Tales for Children - Conn Iggulden, Lizzy Duncan</a> </h3></p><hr/>
