  <title>THE ADVENTURES OF FIRE DRILL&#39;S SON - An American Indian Tlingit children’s fable - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 238&lt;br /&gt;
In this 238th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of The Adventures of Fire Drill&amp;rsquo;s Son An American Indian of the Tlingit tribe who lives in Alaska on the far West Coast of the USA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fire Drill died before his son was born leaving him to be brought up by his mother and Grandmother. Not an ideal situation amongst the American Indian tribes as he would have no-one to speak for him at the tribal councils. Not long after he had been born, Raven was flying around and saw Fire Drill&amp;rsquo;s young widow crying over her baby. He ask why she was crying and she told him. He gave her the easy remedy and Fire Drill&amp;rsquo;s young son was soon fit and healthy and taking his place amongst the braves. But how did this come about you may ask? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read the story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But this was&amp;rsquo;nt the end of the story. Oh no. It was just the beginning. Fire Drill&amp;rsquo;s son went on to have many more adventures while hunting, where he met the wolf who took him on a hunting trip and taught him much more than any brave would learn, and then to the marten people who begged that he stay with them, where he met his friend Dry Cloud. Read of the adventures they have to together. And what of the time he spent with the Mink and the Marten people.&lt;br /&gt;
So don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on the Adventures of Fire Drills son which gives but a glimpse into the lives of the Tlingit people of Alaska.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
