  <title>ADVENTURES of the TEENIE WEENIES - 32 adventures of the Teenie Weenie folk - Written and Illustrated by W M Donahey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 32 adventures of &amp;nbsp;the Teenie Weenies. While they are small in stature, they have the hearts of heroes. But just who are the Teenie Weenies?&lt;br /&gt;
The Teenie Weenies are a very tiny, little people. The Teenie Weenie children are about half an inch, or just over a centimetre, in height and the older Teenie Weenies are from two and a half to three inches tall ( 6 to 8 cm). Paddy Pinn is the tallest one and he really is a Teenie Weenie giant, for he stands four inches (10cm) &amp;nbsp;in his stocking feet.&lt;br /&gt;
The little folks are so small that a lead pencil is to them a great log and a clothes pin will keep the tiny fire place burning for some time. A large tea cup would almost hold the entire family and they could go swimming all at once in a wash basin.&lt;br /&gt;
So, if a piece of cheese goes missing from the fridge, or a reel of cotton should disappear, you now know better than to ask &amp;ldquo;why.&amp;rdquo; And, the next time you are out, be sure to TREAD CAREFULLY!&lt;br /&gt;
Also included are 9 full page colour plates with many, many pen and ink vignettes sprinkled throughout the volume bring the stories to life.&lt;br /&gt;
