To keep her power secret, she leads a quiet life as a healer on a remote mountain, content to help the people in her care and spend time with Ina, the mortal girl she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Asra&amp;#8217;s peaceful life is upended when bandits threaten Ina&amp;#8217;s village and the king does nothing to help. Desperate to protect her people, Ina begs Asra for assistance in finding her manifest&amp;#8212;the animal she&amp;#8217;ll be able to change into as her rite of passage to adulthood. Asra uses her blood magic to help Ina, but her spell goes horribly wrong and the bandits destroy the village, killing Ina&amp;#8217;s family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unaware that Asra is at fault, Ina swears revenge on the king and takes a savage dragon as her manifest. To stop her, Asra must embark on a journey across the kingdom, becoming a player in lethal games of power among assassins, gods, and even the king himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most frightening of all, she discovers the dark secrets of her own mysterious history&amp;#8212;and the terrible, powerful legacy she carries in her blood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
