  <title>Private Eye Cats - S.N. Bronstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scooter and Nugget cannot be content like most other house cats eating, sleeping, and annoying their humans. These two sisters, who just happen to speak English as well as cat talk, decide to sneak outside on a regular basis to explore their neighborhood.
When they overhear their human housemates Tony and Misty discussing a recent burglary in the area, Scooter and Nugget decide to become amateur detectives and solve the case.
Getting outside is easy once Tony and Misty go off to work. Dealing with the challenges of outdoor cats who are unfriendly and downright mean, dogs who would love to prove to them who rules the streets, and a group of gang cats who want them off their turf is not so easy.
One challenge after another seems to prevent the cats from solving the crime. How do they track the criminals down? How do they figure out where the thieves will strike next? What do they do if and when they finally do catch them? Nugget, younger and less experienced than Scooter, does not have a clue how to answer these questions. Scooter, older and wiser, has a plan.
Follow along as the plan is put into action. With the help of Tyrone Williams, a teacher at the local middle school who discovers by accident the secret that the cats can speak English, the plot unfolds.
These private eye cats will reveal to you just how successful two four legged felines can be when they become determined to put a plan into action." />
