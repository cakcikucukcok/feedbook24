  <title>Allegiance - Wanda Wiltshire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 2 of the Betrothed Series 
Harry Potter’s magic, Twilight’s heartache... with a message that love and confidence make everything possible – a faery fantasy with a reality check.
Having returned home, Marla seems to quickly forget her Faery Prince, Leif... And strangely, she starts seeing her best friend Jack in a different way...
Tensions mount within this doomed love triangle after Leif, unwilling to part with his betrothed, strikes a deal with his father, the fiery King Telophy, to travel to Earth to win Marla back.
Meanwhile in the enchanting land of Faera, more and more of King Telophy’s subjects are vanishing – victims of a shadowy presence. 
Leif flies back to Faera, with Marla and Jack to help vanquish this deadly threat.
Shifting shadows, bonds of blood, and with their lives in danger … Marla is conflicted, relying on both Leif and Jack for support. 
But who will she choose? 
And can the three save Faera in time?" />
