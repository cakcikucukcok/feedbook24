  <title>Bong the Bouncing Elephant and His Fantastic Friends - Wayne Teall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have always wanted to write a book ever since I can remember but one day I was listening to a programme on Radio 5, which I dont normally listen to, Sir Terry Pratchett the famous author was on there saying how everyone has something in them but if they cant write it down or if they cant type, try and get it down somehow
After a while, a couple of days after listening to the programme I was asked to go and clear up something at work and funnily enough there were two dictaphones. I thought this was a bit spooky so I decided to use one of the dictaphones and start my book. It wasnt easy, it was difficult at first to talk into a tape recorder and put down your feelings and thoughts on there.
This book was done purely through my imagination, the characters are purely my thoughts and I see how everything was when I was a kid at school, how we were brought up and how the school is broken down into different elements at school, where you have some friends there, some friends there, not so many friends there, no friends there and you went around in a group all your life.
This book is about Bong, how he meets his friends, how he falls out with friends and how he has some great friends and they always will be, this is what the book is all about, friends.  The biggest thing about the book is honour and respect to your friends and family. The characters in the book are also caricatures of themselves which is self-explanatory." />
