  <title>Seventh Born - Monica Sanz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abomination. Curse. Murderer. All names hurled at eighteen-year-old Seraphina Dovetail. As the seventh-born daughter to a witch, she&#39;s the cause of her mother losing her powers and, in turn, her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abandoned as a child, Sera dreams of becoming an inspector and finding her family. To do that, she must be referred into the Advanced Studies Program at the Aetherium&#39;s Witchling Academy. Her birth order, quick temper, and tendency to set things on fire, however, have left her an outcast with failing marks...and just what Professor Nikolai Barrington is looking for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tall, brooding, yet exceedingly handsome young professor makes her a proposition: become his assistant and he&#39;ll give her the referral she needs. Sera is quickly thrust into a world where witches are being kidnapped, bodies are raised from the dead, and someone is burning seventhborns alive. As Sera and Barrington grow ever closer, she&#39;ll discover that some secrets are best left buried...and fire isn&#39;t the only thing that makes a witch burn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Witchling Academy series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Seventh Born&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Mirror Bound&lt;/p&gt;" />
