  <title>Stuck on Earth - David Klass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ketchvar III&#39;s mission is simple: travel to Planet Earth, inhabit the body of an average teenager, and determine if the human race should be annihilated. And so Ketchvar--who, to human eyes, looks just like a common snail--crawls into the brain of one Tom Filber and attempts to do his analysis. At first glance, Tom appears to be the perfect specimen--fourteen years old, good health, above average intelligence. But it soon becomes apparent that Tom Filber may be a little &lt;i&gt;too &lt;/i&gt;average--gawky, awkward, and utterly abhorred by his peers. An alien within an alien&#39;s skin, Ketchvar quickly finds himself wrapped up in the daily drama of teenage life--infuriating family members, raging bullies, and undeniably beautiful next-door neighbors. And the more entangled Ketchvar becomes, the harder it is to answer the question he was sent to Earth to resolve: Should the Sandovinians release the Gagnerian Death Ray and erase the human species for good? Or is it possible that Homo sapiens really are worth saving?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wickedly wry and hysterically skewed, David Klass&#39;s take on teen life on our fabulously flawed Planet Earth is an engrossing look at true friends, truer enemies, and awkward alien first kisses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stuck on Earth&lt;/i&gt; is a 2011 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
