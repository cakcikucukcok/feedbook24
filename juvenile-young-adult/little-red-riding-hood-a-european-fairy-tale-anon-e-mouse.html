  <title>LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD - A European Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 326&lt;br /&gt;
In this 326th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the European Fairy Tale &amp;quot;LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD&amp;rdquo;. Herein you will find the children&amp;#39;s classic fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Red has packed a basket of goodies for her grandma and prepares to leave home to visit her. She dons her red jacket and soon enters the woods. She lifts her red hood to prevent her hair from becoming damp. No sooner has she entered the forest than she meets Mr Wolfe, who asks her where she is going. Not trusting Mr Wolfe, Red gives him scant information and goes on her way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what happens next? Does Red make it to her grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house or does Mr Wolfe ambush her before she gets there? And what of her grandmother? Is she OK or is she next on Mr Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s menu? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
