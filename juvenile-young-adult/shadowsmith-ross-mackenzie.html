  <title>Shadowsmith - Ross Mackenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you brave? 
When the mysterious Amelia Pigeon turns up at Kirby&#39;s bedroom window in the dead of night, this is the question she asks him – immediately before they tumble into a world of ancient malevolent spirits who have torn their way into Kirby&#39;s boring seaside village. 
Kirby isn&#39;t feeling brave at all. His mother is in a coma following a freak (or was it?) accident, and he&#39;s hardly talking to his dad. He&#39;s convinced a spider is watching him, and now a weird girl in a yellow raincoat – who claims to be a powerful, evil-banishing Shadowsmith – is dragging him into unknown danger. How brave is he really? 
Ross MacKenzie, author of the Blue Peter award-winning The Nowhere Emporium, weaves a world of magic and adventure which twists and turns magnificently and will keep thrilled young readers guessing right to the end." />
