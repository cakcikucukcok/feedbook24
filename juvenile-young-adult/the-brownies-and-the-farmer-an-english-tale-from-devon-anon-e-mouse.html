  <title>THE BROWNIES AND THE FARMER - An English tale from Devon - Anon E Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 337&lt;br /&gt;
In this 337th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the English Tale -&amp;quot;THE BROWNIES AND THE FARMER&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, the Brownies were sorrowful, more sorrowful than they had ever been in their lives before, and that is saying a great deal, for Brownies you know, live such a long, long while, and the saddest part of all was that there seemed no way out of their trouble. The Brownies who lived in the apple orchard saw it first and when they told their friends, all with one voice, cried out, &amp;ldquo;The wrong must be righted!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now this was the trouble. Farmer Grump had bought the Old Clover Farm where the Brownies had lived happily for years, and now each day was full of trials and discomforts, for this cruel farmer seemed always to be finding a way to make the life of his stock miserable. The cows had great boards tied over their eyes&amp;mdash;so large that they could not see and so heavy that when the poor creatures went to crop the grass, Bang! Bang! went the board against their noses.&lt;br /&gt;
The pigs suffered too. Into their noses had been driven rings that almost made them bleed when rooting in the ground. And what happiness do you suppose life holds for a pig if he cannot root?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Brownies liked the donkey for he seemed such a patient, long suffering animal but the farmer&amp;rsquo;s children made his life wretched&amp;mdash;they beat him, they stoned him, they even took their naughty little feet and kicked him. At last they could stand it no longer, and all met one night at the &amp;ldquo;Seek us further&amp;rdquo; tree where the oldest Brownies lived, and eventually a decision was made&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What was the decision you ask? What did the Brownies do? Did the teach Farmer Grump and his badly behaved children a lesson? How did Farmer Grump react to this?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, to find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
