A centuries-old unsolved mystery about the beautiful turtle fountain outside her window? Sounds like fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Beatrice has a chance to explore, though, she sees a dark figure emerge from the shadows of the square in the middle of the night&amp;#8212;and steal the famous turtle sculptures that give the fountain its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When no one believes her story, Beatrice knows that it&amp;#8217;s up to her to solve the crime and restore the turtles to their rightful place.
