  <title>The fourth millennium - Cargo of clones - Piero Boi</title>

Tuiavii’s destiny had assigned him much greater tasks than the ones he has completed so far, tasks that he could never have imagined.
How could any man think that the destiny of the entire Solar System could depend on his own decisions and actions?
And yet only he - with the help of the important friends he meets during his cosmic journeys to the various planets, and guided by the omniscient light that the Patriarch entrusts him with - will have to ward off the cruellest threat that the entire planetary system has ever faced." />
