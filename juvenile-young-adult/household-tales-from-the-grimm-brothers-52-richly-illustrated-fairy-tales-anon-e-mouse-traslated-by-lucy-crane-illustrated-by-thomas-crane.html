  <title>HOUSEHOLD TALES FROM THE GRIMM BROTHERS - 52 Richly Illustrated Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Traslated by Lucy Crane, Illustrated by Thomas Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 52 richly illustrated tales compiled by the Grimm Brothers (Jakob and Wilhelm) for children. They have been translated into English by Lucy Crane, daughter of Thomas Crane, who illustrated this volume.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book includes well known stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
THE GOOSE GIRL&lt;br /&gt;
THE FROG PRINCE&lt;br /&gt;
RAPUNZEL&lt;br /&gt;
RUMPELSTILTSKIN&lt;br /&gt;
SNOW WHITE&lt;br /&gt;
TOM THUMB&lt;br /&gt;
SLEEPING BEAUTY&lt;br /&gt;
HANSEL AND GRETHEL and many others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an original retelling of CINDERELLA, then you will find it disguised as ASCHENPUTTEL, the German name for the same story. It also includes less well known tales, like:&lt;br /&gt;
THE MOUSE, THE BIRD&amp;nbsp; AND THE SAUSAGE&lt;br /&gt;
MOTHER HULDA&lt;br /&gt;
LITTLE RED CAP&lt;br /&gt;
THE BREMEN TOWN MUSICIANS&lt;br /&gt;
PRUDENT HANS&lt;br /&gt;
CLEVER ELSE and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was the first volume published by the Grimm Bros. in 1812. The seventh and final volume, published in 1857, had a collection of some 211 unique fairy tales. It was this final collection that cemented the world-wide fame of the Jakob and Wilhelm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We invite you to download this &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; translation from 1886, then sit back in front of a roaring fire and enjoy these tales which have come to us from the mists of time.&lt;br /&gt;
