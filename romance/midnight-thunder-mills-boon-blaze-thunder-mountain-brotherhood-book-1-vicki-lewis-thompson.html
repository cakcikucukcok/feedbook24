  <title>Midnight Thunder (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (Thunder Mountain Brotherhood, Book 1) - Vicki Lewis Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The lost cowboy…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thunder Mountain Ranch was the only place cowboy Cade Gallagher had ever called home. But after he and Lexi Simmons broke each other&#39;s hearts, he left it behind, along with his foster family. Since then, Cade has drifted, looking for something–anything–to call home. Until a call from Lexi changes everything…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cade has been gone too long. His foster mother is hospitalized, and the ranch is in deep financial trouble. Yet even as his world crumbles, Cade&#39;s hunger for Lexi is almost as tangible as the taste of her lips and the way her body fits deliciously against his. It&#39;s bittersweet surrender. But Lexi isn&#39;t the girl she used to be, and she&#39;s determined to have the hot cowboy in her bed only if she keeps him out of her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
