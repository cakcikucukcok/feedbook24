  <title>Summer At The Shore (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) - Carol Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Saving lives is who they are&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Risking his life for others is all in a day’s work for Coast Guard Petty Officer Jay Johnston. Until he comes to the rescue of Mia Frasier after her small plane goes down. Maybe it’s because the empathic, blue-eyed vet wants to save the world just as passionately as Jay wants to create a safe haven for his five younger siblings, but there&#39;s no denying their bond. Despite his growing feelings for Mia, a romantic relationship isn’t on Jay’s radar. How can two people always on the move stay in one place long enough to create a family of their own?&lt;/p&gt;
