      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Will Wyatt has always played the part of pirate, but now he&#39;s a fish out of water in the Highlands of Scotland. With a bounty on his head, he&#39;s laying low by helping his sister and a troop of abandoned children journey to a new home. He didn&#39;t count on a spunky Highland lass stealing his breath after he steals a kiss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonet Montgomery has longed for a chivalrous knight her whole young life. Instead she found herself wed to a cheating scoundrel and left a widow. Giving up on love, Jonet turned to helping the orphaned children of her clan, but when a lusty, silver-tongued rogue opens a crack in Jonet&#39;s routine life, she&#39;s tempted by his offer to taste adventure of the most pleasurable kind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will&#39;s heart of gold shines through despite his infamous past, making Jonet risk her reputation once again. But can she possibly be enough woman to keep this sexy pirate from straying? With her past embarrassment haunting her, she risks more than just her reputation this time. She risks her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Highland Hearts series can be read out of order, but is best enjoyed in order. &lt;br&gt;Highland Hearts reading order: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#1 Captured Heart   &lt;br&gt;#2 Tangled Hearts&lt;br&gt;#3 Untamed Hearts      &lt;br&gt;#4 Crimson Heart     &lt;br&gt;#5 Highland Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
