        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The assignment was clear: neutralize the dangerous assassin who had targeted the head of the Colby Agency. But how was CIA recruit Tasha North supposed to accomplish it? The assassin was highly skilled, had no fear, no conscience. No name.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So she used the one weapon that affected him as no other could–herself. Slowly Tasha began to earn his trust, to find the pieces of humanity left in him after years of abuse. But after they shared so much, could she complete her assignment? Especially when she learned his true identity?&lt;/p&gt;
