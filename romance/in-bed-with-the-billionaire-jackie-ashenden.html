  <title>In Bed With the Billionaire - Jackie Ashenden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the final Nine Circles novel, there is a fine line between pleasure and pain, between sin and salvation. Jackie Ashenden shows what happens when a dangerously irresistible man and woman collide, in and out of the bedroom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Bed with the Billionaire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known to the underworld only as Jericho, billionaire Theo Fitzgerald is one of the most powerful men in the world. But his plan is to tear down the criminal empire his father created from the inside out--unless someone else does it for him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suspects a bold, seductive woman named Temple Cross might be trying to take him out with it--but for the chance to burn in the heat she gives off, he&#39;s not sure if he minds...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hired hit woman, Temple has been waiting to get close to Jericho her whole life. The man who destroyed her family is worth looking in the eye before she kills him--but when she&#39;s finally alone with Jericho, he&#39;s nothing like the ruthless barbarian she imagined. Her reaction to his touch is explosively sexual--and their emotional connection is too powerful for her to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is she his shot at redemption? Or will he have to risk losing her love to save her life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenge and redemption, pain and passion collide in this stunningly emotional, edgy, sexy romance from Jackie Ashenden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other books in the Nine Circle series:&lt;br&gt;Book #1: Mine to Take&lt;br&gt;Book #2: Make You Mine&lt;br&gt;Book #3: You Are Mine&lt;br&gt;Book #4: Kidnapped by the Billionaire&lt;/p&gt;" />
