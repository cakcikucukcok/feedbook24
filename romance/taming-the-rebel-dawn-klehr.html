  <title>Taming the Rebel - Dawn Klehr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rebel Hart should be at home taking care of her father after his breakup with his boyfriend, not tromping through the woods at summer camp. He&#39;s had his heart broken beyond repair, and the way she sees it, there&#39;s only one person to blame--the boyfriend&#39;s son. So when that infuriatingly gorgeous quarterback turns up at the same camp, she plans to make him pay.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justice Brody isn&#39;t happy about trading training camp for actual summer camp. But if he wants to stay on the football team, he has to show that he can be drama-free. He welcomes the anonymity that comes with summer camp...until he realizes the one girl who knows him better than anyone is there, too. Rebel is off-limits, impossibly beautiful...and trouble with a capital T. Still, he can&#39;t stay away. And even as Rebel exacts her revenge, in several very embarrassing and painful ways, neither can she.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains pranks, adult language, and kisses that will make you wish for a summer romance of your own.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
