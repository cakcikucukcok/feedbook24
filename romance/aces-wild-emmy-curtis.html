  <title>Aces Wild - Emmy Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The most elite military pilots in the world are about to engage in some friendly competition. Only this year, someone is changing all the rules...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  RAF pilot Dexter Stone has been through his fair share of sticky situations. After living through a crash in enemy territory where no one expected him to walk away, the Red Flag training exercises should be a piece of cake--assuming he can keep his mind on the mission and not on the smart mouth of his gorgeous American competition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As one of the few women in a sky full of hotshot flyboys, Maj. Eleanor Daniels has worked day and night to earn a coveted spot at Red Flag. And she&#39;s not about to let some cocky British bad boy distract her from winning. But when the games take a deadly turn, he may be her only hope for survival.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;What happens when you mix aerial combat training, dogfights, sexy pilots, conspiracies and cover ups and add a big dollop of romance? You have a story that just can&#39;t lose.&quot; --Heroes &amp; Heartbreakers on &lt;i&gt;Aces Wild&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;A wild ride of espionage, sabotage, and finding love in extraordinary circumstances.&quot; --Fresh Fiction on &lt;i&gt;Aces Wild&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Curtis&#39;s fast-paced novel avoids the annoying trope of the female soldier having to prove herself to the male soldier. Eleanor and Dex are thrown together right away and work as a team from the beginning. And with a vibrant cast of fellow pilots and soldiers, &lt;i&gt;Aces Wild&lt;/i&gt; is an exhilarating start to the Elite Ops series.&quot; -- BookPage on &lt;i&gt;Aces Wild&lt;/i&gt;" />
