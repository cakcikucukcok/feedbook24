      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;His trainers said that blood is the driving force of a shifter soldier. They were right. Tyrone would kill a thousand men if it meant kissing Melissa every day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood and love: these are the things that rule Tyrone. Leopard and man fight each other daily, neither ever fully gaining control. Every instinct must be kept in check. There is but one person tethering him to sanity. Melissa. His angel. She is the only light in his darkness. While, within himself, Tyrone fights one precarious battle, outside he must fight another. The Nevada Pride has brought the fight to Blackburn soil and spilled innocent blood. Swift retaliation is necessary as wolves, felines, and bears must come together to protect their families and secure their lands before Nevada strikes again. Unfortunately, Tyrone and his twin sister are known for breaking the rules. Their feline family has never wholly trusted the wolves and now the feeling might be mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tyrone risks everything to protect two escaping hostages straight from enemy territory, he is put at odds with the Blackburn alpha in order to secure their safety. And Kasey Blackburn is not a man to cross&amp;hellip;especially not under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As battles are waged inside and out of the Nevada and Blackburn packs, deception threatens their bonds. Can they unite against their enemies? Is Tyrone strong enough to control his beast? Or, will his darkness be the one thing that destroys them all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catch up on the previous Blake Pride books:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The&amp;nbsp;Blake Pride&amp;nbsp;series is a great series that readers of paranormal fantasy and romance will thoroughly enjoy.

They are on the run from a sadistic alpha when they fall into wolf territory. Pack alpha, Kasey Blackburn, must deal with the group of renegade felines, including a wolf pack who wants them gone, and the death sentence they carry. Human and animal instincts war. Who will win?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break Her Fall, book 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As beta female of the Blake Pride, Amilynn does whatever it takes to get the job done and guard her family&amp;mdash;even if it might not be morally sound. Now that the Pride has moved in with the Blackburn Pack, she faces a threat she never saw coming&amp;hellip;a &lt;em&gt;mate&lt;/em&gt;. The sexy and persistent wolf wants to claim the leopardess, but she&amp;rsquo;s not going down without a fight. When a ghost from Amilynn&amp;rsquo;s past stalks their family, Ezekiel will learn her true strength. Amilynn isn&amp;rsquo;t a docile house cat and, by the time she&amp;rsquo;s done, everyone will know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Harder They Fall, book 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conall needs a breather so he happily volunteers to take supplies to a mountain-dwelling widow and get away for a few days. Madelyn has been alone for a decade. Her inner bear is still haunted by her past yet can&amp;#39;t seem to dismiss her guest. While Conall and Madelyn are tucked away in the woods, disaster strikes. Conall is forced to choose: save the girl or save the family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
