          &lt;strong&gt;The CEO’s Scandalous Affair &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miami millionaire Parker Garrison had dated every eligible woman in the city. So when he needed a last-minute escort he turned to his ever-efficient assistant, Anna. Who knew she would turn into such a beauty and make Parker rethink his policy on inter-office affairs…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Seduced by the Wealthy Playboy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brittany Garrison was about to lose her beloved restaurant. So when handsome millionaire Emilio offered her an irresistible proposition, Brittany signed on the dotted line and sealed the deal with a kiss. But she was unaware of their families’ feud and Emilio’s intentions…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Millionaire’s Wedding Revenge &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miami millionaire Stephen Garrison wanted revenge. His ex-lover Megan had ended their sizzling affair without an explanation! But then he learned she’d had his child! Now a seductive revenge wouldn’t satisfy him. Only marriage would be the ultimate payback!&lt;/p&gt;
