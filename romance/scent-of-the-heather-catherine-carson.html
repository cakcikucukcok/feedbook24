      <meta name="description" content="Maggie Gregory has known James Henderson all her life as he lives and owns Craiglachan Castle which lies next to the estate belonging to her family.  When James became engaged to Margot Archibald, she valiantly hid the fact she is totally and hopelessly in love with him. Maggie resigns herself never to be anything other than a surrogate sister to him, as she is often accused of poking her nose into affairs which do not concern her.  Discovering his fiancée is cheating on him with his cousin Euan Bartholomew, Maggie keeps her own counsel without realising Euan&#39;s conscience has driven him to confess his betrayal. Maggie finds herself the brunt of hurtful rumours as the local community blames her for James&#39; broken betrothal. As a result he bans her from ever setting foot on Craiglachan land again." />
