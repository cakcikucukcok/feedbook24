  <title>Intercepting Daisy - Julie Brannagh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Daisy Spencer wrote an erotic novella about the Seattle Sharks&amp;#8217; backup quarterback and her #1 crush, Grant Parker, she never expected it to become a runaway bestseller. If anyone discovers she wrote the sexy story, her days as a flight attendant for the Sharks would be over. But once she gets to know the real man behind the fantasy, her heart may be in more danger than her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having Seattle fans think squeaky clean Grant is wild in bed is the last thing he needs&amp;#8212;even if it might be closer to the truth than he will ever say. As he spends his days, and nights, with the gorgeous Daisy, he&amp;#8217;s not interested in going back to the lonely life he once led. But when the real author of the novella is finally outed, Grant and Daisy must both reveal the secrets they&amp;#8217;ve hidden away or risk losing a love that&amp;#8217;s better than any fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
