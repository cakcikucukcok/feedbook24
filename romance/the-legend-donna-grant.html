They live to love the women who have captured their souls.  These are the Sons of Texas, from New York Times bestselling author Donna Grant.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Legend, &lt;/i&gt;Callie Reed doesn&#39;t need a man to protect her. An expert sharpshooter and renegade hacker, this Texas-born spitfire&#39;s got the skills and the courage to stand up to any danger--no matter how deadly. But when she becomes the target of a shadowy organization known as the Saints, Callie is forced to team up with the one man she can&#39;t outshoot: the gorgeous, and infuriating, Lone Star legend named Wyatt Loughman... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Delta Force Colonel with a rock-hard body and stone-cold heart, Wyatt has been teasing and tormenting Callie since they were playmates on his family&#39;s ranch. Of course, he&#39;s wildly attracted to the fiery, strong-willed Callie. But he&#39;s always hidden his feelings behind a wall of Texas tough and military cool, even as he&#39;s burning up with desire. Can Wyatt save Callie&#39;s life--without putting her love in the line of fire?&lt;/p&gt;" />
