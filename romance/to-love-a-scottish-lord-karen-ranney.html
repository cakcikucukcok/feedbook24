  <title>To Love a Scottish Lord - Karen Ranney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Lord Not Meant to Marry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamish MacRae, a changed man, returned to his  beloved Scotland intending to turn his back on the world. The proud, brooding lord wants nothing more than to be left alone, but an unwanted visitor to his lonely castle  has defied his wishes. While it is true that this healer, Mary Gilly, is a beauty beyond compare, it will take more than her miraculous potions to soothe his wounded spirit. But Mary&#39;s tender heart is slowly melting Hamish&#39;s frozen one . . . awakening a burning need to keep  her with him -- forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Lady Who Dares Not Love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never before has Mary felt such an attraction to a man! The mysterious Hamish MacRae is strong and commanding, with a face and form so handsome it makes Mary tremble with wanting him. Already shadowy forces are coming closer, heartless whispers and cruel rumors abound, and it will take a love more pure and powerful than any other to divine the truth -- and  promise a future neither had dreamed possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
