  <title>Hidden Agendas - Lora Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAVING LIVES IS HIS &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;MISSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tough-as-nails Navy SEAL Kell Kreiger is the best there is at searching, rescuing, and taking no prisoners...yet even the rush of ever-more dangerous missions isn&#39;t enough to satisfy him. Haunted by a tortured past, Kell seeks distraction in a secret world of dark intimacies. But when Emily Stanton, the one ray of light in Kell&#39;s shadowy existence, is pursued by a ruthless drug lord, the rules of the game suddenly change--and Kell will have to go deeper undercover than he ever imagined...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAVING HER IS HIS PASSION.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily has loved Kell ever since her father, a prominent politician, rescued him from a brutal life on the streets. They were kids then, too young to act on what was growing between them...but now that Emily is ready, the handsome, headstrong SEAL has decided he&#39;s no good for her. Ever since he rescued her from Diego Fuentes&#39; compound, Kell&#39;s only duty has been to keep Emily safe. But Fuentes isn&#39;t finished with Emily--or Kell. And to protect Emily, Kell has no choice but to lay himself--body, soul, and secrets--bare...and fight against evil with all his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
