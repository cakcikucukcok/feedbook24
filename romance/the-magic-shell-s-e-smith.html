  <title>The Magic Shell - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ross Galloway is more than ready for a new life away from Yachats, Oregon. All he needs for his plans to fall into place is a little money and a lot of luck. He gets his break when he discovers something out of this world on one of his dives &amp;ndash; a real-life mermaid.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
His plans to cash in on his discovery don&amp;rsquo;t work out quite the way he&amp;rsquo;d planned when the mermaid gives him an unexpected gift &amp;ndash; a magic shell. Swept overboard by the spell contained within the shell, Ross surfaces in a strange, bizarre world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Princess Gem LaBreeze is an Elemental, a powerful species that can control the elements. Transformed to stone to protect her from the evil threatening the Isle of the Elementals, she is awakened by a man from another world &amp;ndash; a stranger who is as arrogant and uncouth as he is unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gem and Ross, forced together in a desperate race against time, learn that opposites can attract and that sometimes the roughest surface hides the tenderest of hearts. Can an unlikely hero and a lone woman survive the traps set to stop a destructive alien creature that has been unleashed, or will the Isle of the Elementals fall back into the ocean and disappear beneath the waves forever?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of adventure and romance. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid scenes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
