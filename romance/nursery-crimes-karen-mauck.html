Jillian Hobart is passionate about teaching and devoted to her class of kindergartners. But someone else is showing a more deadly interest in her students, leaving eerie nursery rhymes behind as her students begin to disappear.&lt;p&gt;
Deputy Sheriff Peter Dack is attracted to Jillian&#39;s quiet intensity even though his job requires he keep her at arm&#39;s length.
