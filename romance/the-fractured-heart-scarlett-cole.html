  <title>The Fractured Heart - Scarlett Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thrown together by fate and friends, a bad boy tattoo artist and down on her luck waitress are about to find that opposites really do attract in the follow-up to Scarlett Cole&#39;s &lt;/i&gt;The Strongest Steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All things, when placed under pressure, eventually break or leave a mark. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tattoo artist Brody &quot;Cujo&quot; Matthews knows how to keep things simple. Tattoos, a good time with friends--and steer clear of relationships.Abandoned as a child by a mother who refused to stick around to raise three boys she didn&#39;t want, he has no interest in getting involved with complicated women. That all changes when he&#39;s asked to help organize his best friend Trent&#39;s engagement party, which means working with Trent&#39;s fiancée&#39;s best friend, Drea, the definition of high maintenance and sizzling curves. And the one woman he doesn&#39;t want to walk away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea &quot;Drea&quot; Caron is broke and tired. After years of caring for her ailing mom, she&#39;s at the end of her rope trying to manage the piling medical bills, two jobs, and a life placed on hold. She certainly doesn&#39;t need the added frustration of a sexy playboy tattoo artist messing up her best friend&#39;s engagement party or her carefully balanced life. But when Drea witnesses the abduction of a woman from the café she works at, she can&#39;t help but turn to the sexy, inked Cujo, who&#39;s determined to prove to Drea that he&#39;s someone she can count on forever.  But as they attempt to bring the truth to light, someone is working to bring that forever to a sudden, deadly halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fractured Heart &lt;/i&gt;is a full-length romance in the Second Circle Tattoos series that can be read as a standalone!&lt;/p&gt;" />
