      <meta name="description" content="Johnny, a top company executive and Joy, an escort lady fall in love with each other after they see each other for just a few seconds. He wanted a hike but she drives past. He is overwhelmingly handsome, and she is devastatingly beautiful.
He maneuvers himself through a couple of steamy one-night stand relationships before he gets to her. It was purely an affair of the heart when they finally meet as their relationship started and ended up, within twenty-four hours, in a marriage. Passion was at its peak as it evolved through a couple of very steamy sexual encounters as they intimately explored each other.
