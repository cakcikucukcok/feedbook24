  <title>Eat, Drink, and Be Married - Rebecca Bloom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When college friends Kate, Nina and Zo take holiday from their busy schedules on opposite coasts to join their former roommate, Hannah, for her wedding in Lake Tahoe, they not only bring suitcases packed with what-not-to-wear bridesmaid dresses, but baggage of a more emotional kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported by a variety of eclectic characters determined to wreck havoc on their carefully organized lives, each woman is forced to come to terms with her past before she walks down the aisle. Zo must learn how to reveal a vulnerability beneath her bravado before she can finally open her heart. Kate needs to reclaim her identity before she can regain her strut. Nina must heal her own inner child so she can provide for another. Hannah needs to release a ghost in order to recover her spirit.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bottle of booze, a host of laughs, a hankie or two worth of tears, and seventy-two hours among those who know and love them the most is the perfect recipe for four women to &lt;i&gt;Eat, Drink, and Be Married&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
