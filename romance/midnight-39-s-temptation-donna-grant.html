  <title>Midnight&#39;s Temptation - Donna Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ever since that fateful night, he can&#39;t stop thinking about her. A timeless beauty in a nightclub, she moved across the dance floor like an angel, surrendering to the music--and casting a spell that could only be magic. When Phelan took her in his arms and kissed her, the Highlander knew this was no ordinary woman. This was a Druidess who could fulfill his every desire--or destroy him completely...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is a mystery--a woman on the run, hunted by two different men. As much as she longs to be captured by the magnificent warrior Phelan, she knows she must resist the temptation. A vengeful evil is stalking her, watching her every move--a madman who will stop at nothing to possess her power. Once, she sold a piece of her soul for magic. Is she willing to risk Phelan&#39;s life, and give up her heart...for love? &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Midnight&#39;s Tem&lt;/i&gt;ptation is a Dark Warriors novel from&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Donna Grant.&lt;/p&gt;" />
