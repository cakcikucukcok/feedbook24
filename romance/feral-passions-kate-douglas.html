  <title>Feral Passions - Kate Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A COMPLETE SET!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Feral Passions, a luxurious private resort nestled in a woodland preserve and staffed by dangerously sexy men, making it a haven for women who want to get away from it all. But Feral Passions is a front for a deeper, sexier secret--it&#39;s a hunting ground for these men. Men focused on meeting each woman&#39;s every need. Men who are also the beautiful wolves running wild--each of them searching for a mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feral Passions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chereza Dubios is more comfortable solving math equations than she is with her voluptuous body and meeting men. But when her younger sister and best friend trick her into vacationing at Feral Passions, Cherry finds herself attracted and torn between two men who find her curvy body and intelligent mind irresistible. Two men who share a secret--they want to share her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that takes trust--can Cherry open herself to love with two sensual and powerful werewolves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wild Passions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four women--friends closer than sisters--head off to an exclusive mountain resort for a week-long bachelorette getaway, where most of the women just want to know if there are any good men left in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, and they&#39;re the men of Feral Passions...this will be one  bachelorette party the women will never forget!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dangerous Passions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pack alpha Traker Jakes and his lieutenant Evan Dark are the last single men standing as the season draws to a close at the Feral Passions resort--until the appearance of two strong, sexy women alters the threat of a long, cold, &lt;i&gt;lonely &lt;/i&gt;winter. But Darnell and Chelo are stalked by danger--danger that threatens everyone in the pack at Feral Passions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
