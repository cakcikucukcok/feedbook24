  <title>Can&#39;t Help Falling in Love - Cheryl Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The staff of Cheryl Harper&#39;s Elvis-themed Rock&#39;n&#39;Rolla Hotel are back with a funny, fresh romance that goes undercover&amp;#8212;under the covers!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former Marine, hotel manager Tony Ortega has plenty of experience assessing threats, and the hotel&#39;s newest guest, Randa Whitmore, is a code red. Tall, blonde, and with legs for miles, she may look like his every fantasy, but he knows she&#39;s not really visiting for the famed Elvis Week. Though dangerously drawn to his new guest, Tony will do anything to protect his job . . . especially if it means sleeping with the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business strategist Randa Whitmore never meant to be undercover in Memphis. In August. Sweating her expensive spa treatments away. But snagging another perfect hotel location for her father&#39;s empire means using all the tricks in her designer arsenal. And even though the sexy, tattooed manager seems oblivious to her charms, Randa&#39;s prepared to bring out the big guns&amp;#8212;just so long as she can stay objective and out of Tony&#39;s muscled arms. After all, it&#39;s just business, right?&lt;/p&gt;" />
