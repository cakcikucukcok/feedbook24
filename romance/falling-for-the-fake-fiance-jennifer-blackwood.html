  <title>Falling for the Fake Fiance - Jennifer Blackwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jill Michaels prides herself on one thing: being independent. That is until her daughter gets into an elite school, and she needs money more than ever. It seems her fairy godmother--aka her deceased Grammy--has granted that wish in the form of one-fourth of her estate. The only catch? She must be married by her thirtieth birthday. In two months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aaron Collins is fresh out of the army and back in town to help his father&#39;s failing business. When he runs into Jill at a hotel where she&#39;s attending a single&#39;s mixer, he makes sure she doesn&#39;t make it past his room and into another guy&#39;s arms. When he hears about her predicament, he has a plan: they&#39;ll get married and keep it a secret. And maybe have a little sexy fun until he leave towns for his new job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But letting go of the woman of his dreams may be harder than Aaron could have ever imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Snowpocalypse series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Landing the Air Marshal&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Falling for the Fake Fiance&lt;/p&gt;" />
