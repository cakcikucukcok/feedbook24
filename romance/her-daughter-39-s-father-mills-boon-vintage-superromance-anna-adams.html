          &lt;strong&gt;She didn&#39;t know how wrong the right decision could be&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her Daughter&#39;s Mother:&lt;/strong&gt; India Stuart wants to know her child, but she gave up that right fifteen years ago. Still, she feels compelled to make sure her daughter&#39;s safe and happy with her adoptive parents.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her Daughter&#39;s Father:&lt;/strong&gt; India has a simple plan–sneak into town and observe her daughter from a distance. But things don&#39;t work out that way. Before she knows it, she&#39;s involved in her daughter&#39;s life…and falling in love with her daughter&#39;s widowed father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her Daughter:&lt;/strong&gt; India&#39;s daughter, Colleen, has a plan, too. Get her father and India together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;India can almost believe that Colleen&#39;s play will work. But deep down she knows it can&#39;t. Because once the truth is out, no one will forgive her for lying.&lt;/p&gt;
