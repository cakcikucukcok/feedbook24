  <title>Rising Star Chef Trilogy - Louisa Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Featuring &lt;i&gt;Too Hot to Touch, Some Like it Hot, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Hot Under Pressure &lt;/i&gt;together for the first time in one delicious e-bundle you won&#39;t be able to stop devouring over and over again!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A dash of gorgeous brothers, with a pinch of forbidden romance, and just  a hint of undeniable chemistry, the Rising Star Chef trilogy is the  perfect recipe for a sizzling romance.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;TOO HOT TO TOUCH&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master Chef--and sinfully attractive--Max Lunden has spent the past few years winning cooking competitions and traveling around the world, picking up cooking techniques as well as beautiful woman. He doesn&#39;t play well with others, but now he&#39;s cooking in the country&#39;s biggest competition alongside Juliet Cavanaugh, a chef he&#39;s known for years who is every bit as passionate as he is. As the attraction simmers between them, can Max and Juliet keep their cool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SOME LIKE IT HOT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sexy, single, and even sweeter than the treats he bakes, pastry chef Danny Lunden is trying to stay focused on the Rising Star Chef competition and not get hot and bothered over the gorgeous woman he keeps running into. Especially since the woman is Eva Jansen: the billionaire heiress in charge of the cooking competition. But when they share a kiss hot enough to start a kitchen fire, they&#39;ll have to break every rule in the cookbook to indulge in their secret craving, because one bite is never enough...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;HOT UNDER PRESSURE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Navy cook Henry Beck thought he&#39;d already faced the toughest challenge of his life...until he learns that his competition for the title of Rising Star Chef is the woman he married--then left--ten years ago. But Skye Gladwell wants more than a win over the man who abandoned her: she wants a divorce. So her sexy almost-ex makes a deliciously dangerous proposition: he&#39;ll give into her demands, but if his team wins, Henry wants one last taste of the only woman he&#39;s ever loved...&lt;/p&gt;" />
