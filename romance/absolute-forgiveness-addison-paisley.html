  <title>Absolute Forgiveness - Addison Paisley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Struggling to deal with her mother&#39;s tragic death and in love with Heather, a woman she thinks she cannot have-Andrea Reynolds decides to leave it all behind and start her life over again.&lt;/P&gt;
When fate intervenes, bringing Andrea, unexpectedly, back into Heather&#39;s life, both women struggle with their emotions.&lt;/P&gt;
Seeing Heather again, after eight years, sends Andrea sliding into a self-destructive tailspin. She can&#39;t eat, she can&#39;t sleep, and she can&#39;t find a way to move on. Seeing Heather again wasn&#39;t part of her precisely executed plan.&lt;/P&gt;
Still scorned by Andrea&#39;s actions, Heather fights to hold on to her anger. The pain remains, but her heart and her body have minds of their own.&lt;/P&gt;
Their journey is marred by obstacles and misunderstandings. Unfortunate timing is a constant barrier; and, Rebecca, Heather&#39;s deceptive and vindictive ex-girlfriend, refuses to let go.&lt;/P&gt;
Loving each other is easy-forgiving each other seems almost impossible.&lt;/P&gt;" />
