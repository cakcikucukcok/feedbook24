She&#39;s not looking for love, but her hot new landlord is determined to change her mind.

But when hunky carpenter Leo Dawson shows up, she&#39;d much rather have his capable hands on her than on a hammer. He&#39;s not the kind of guy she always thought she&#39;d fall for, but when he touches her, she can&#39;t imagine wanting anyone else . . ." />
