      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah Keating was sure she&#39;d be married by 30. Husband, kids, the kick-ass career helping adults with Down Syndrome--she assumed she&#39;d have it all, and there&#39;d be no need to fall back on the marriage pact she made with her best pal from college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a tipsy message she sends from her birthday party brings Ian Nolan to her door ready to rock her world, and not just with mind-blowing sex. He&#39;s up for tying the knot, and has a million pragmatic reasons it makes perfectly good sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Sarah and Ian test drive their marriage-of-convenience, they navigate awkward business dinners, a slippery steam room hookup, and a costume party gone awry. Their friendship is stronger than ever, and the sexual chemistry is off the charts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is that enough to make a marriage work, or will one of them fall hard and end up brokenhearted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the The List series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The List&lt;br&gt;* The Test&lt;br&gt;* The Last&lt;/p&gt;" />
