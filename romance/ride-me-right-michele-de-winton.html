Desperate for money to send home to support her kid sister, Lucy takes a housekeeping job at Wilde Hotel, the adopted home of the Raising Hellfire MC. After a steamy moonlit encounter with a dark stranger, Lucy is horrified to find out he&#39;s her new boss so she&#39;s more determined than ever to make her hotel stay brief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake &quot;The Iceman&quot; Slade is drowning in guilt and can&#39;t give himself a break. A tragic accident on set made him step away from his job as a real life action hero in the film lots of Hollywood. Now he&#39;s reluctantly agreed to run his half-sister&#39;s hotel, Wilde&#39;s, while she&#39;s away, trying to keep it--and himself--from going under. Lucy is the kind of trouble he can&#39;t afford, but can&#39;t seem to resist. But with an equally troubled past, will Lucy be the fire to melt his frozen heart? &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Ride Me Right &lt;/i&gt;is a sexy, emotionally intense read that will take readers on the ride of their lives from &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Michele De Winton!&lt;/p&gt;" />
