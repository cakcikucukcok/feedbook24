  <title>The Virgin&#39;s Secret - Victoria Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even the least sensible woman knew, upon meeting his gaze, that here was a man who was more than he might at first appear, who might steal the heart of even the most resistant woman. But oh, what a lovely theft!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adventurer Nathanial Harrington would never steal another man&#39;s discovery. And he&#39;d never be so dishonorable as to tempt an untouched woman into his bed . . . even one as stunningly beautiful as Gabriella Montini. Yet she intrigues him. What is her secret? Nate would do anything to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathanial is an earl&#39;s son&amp;#8212;but Gabriella knows he&#39;s not to be trusted! He&#39;s more than just a mere thief of hearts, he&#39;s also stolen her brother&#39;s good name. Determined to restore his reputation, she&#39;d even masquerade as a destitute orphan and be taken into his family&#39;s home. But how can she continue her ruse when she finds herself succumbing to Nathanial&#39;s passionate charms?&lt;/p&gt;" />
