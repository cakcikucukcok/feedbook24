          &lt;strong&gt;‘You’re pregnant.’&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When midwife Callie Taylor agreed to be the surrogate mother for her best friend Dr Lucas Gold she couldn’t have predicted that his marriage would fall apart &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; when she became pregnant with his child…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly her life has changed for ever, and Callie’s terrified of becoming a mum to the baby she never dreamed of keeping. Even more terrifying are the feelings she’s starting to develop for Lucas—feelings that have nothing to do with her hormones…and absolutely &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; to do with his scorching kiss!&lt;/p&gt;
