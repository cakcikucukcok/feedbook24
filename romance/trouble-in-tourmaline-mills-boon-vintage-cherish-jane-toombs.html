  <title>Trouble In Tourmaline (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Jane Toombs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THERE&#39;S A NEW MAN IN TOWN…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-lawyer David Severin came to Tourmaline to escape his problems. Psychologist Amy Simon came to Tourmaline to solve problems. But working at the counseling center run by David&#39;s aunt, she couldn&#39;t help but notice that the brooding, private man had issues. And a great body.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first time Amy saw David she mistook him for the gardener. He was naked from the waist up, and his muscular chest was beaded with sweat from a day of hard labor. But underneath his rough exterior, Amy knew there lay a man filled with raw pain and endearing tenderness. So when his young daughter showed up on his doorstep, Amy couldn&#39;t help butting in…and falling in love with them both. And that&#39;s when the trouble in Tourmaline began….&lt;/p&gt;
