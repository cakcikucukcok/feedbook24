She&#39;s been secretly lusting after her mysterious boss, Anthony Cross, for years. There&#39;s no way she should agree to help him rebuild if she wants to keep her heart intact, and yet it&#39;s impossible to stay away...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flames that destroyed Anthony Cross&#39;s beloved bar are nothing compared to the heat he feels every time he lays eyes on Claudia. But he can&#39;t have her—it&#39;s against paranormal law for a vampire to date a human. Besides, he has some dangerous enemies, and one in particular already has her sights on Claudia. He owes her the truth—both about his feelings and his vampire nature—which means their lives are about to get hotter than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flirting with Fangs Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Flirting Under a Full Moon (Book 1)&lt;br&gt; How to Date a Dragon (Book 2)&lt;br&gt;Kissing with Fangs (Book 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Ashlyn Chase:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Original and full of laughs, steamy sex, and madcap mayhem.&quot;-Night Owl Romance Reviews&lt;br&gt; &quot;Hot sex scenes and a breezy tone with a nice, happily-ever-after ending makes...a fun read.&quot;-&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&#39;s Something He&#39;s Never Told Her...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her workplace burned down, Claudia should&#39;ve taken it as a sign to move on—and not just professionally.
