  <title>Rainbow’S End - Edwina Orth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jason, a college student with dreams of becoming an oceanographer, is on the run until he can prove his innocence. Framed for thievery by his uncle, he has been in the cold for hours when he finally stumbles upon a boarded-up summer cottage. After he cracks the padlock on the door, Jason scrapes together a meal and falls asleep. A short time later, he awakens and feels a presence in the room. It soon becomes evident he is not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen-year-old Lyndell is running from her stepfather who has designs on her trust fund and is willing to do anything to get his hands on it, including forcing her to marry his drunken friend. With her on her journey is Duke, her self-appointed guard dog. When she discovers Jason inside the cottage, the two exchange stories and Jason quickly decides he must protect her. As Jason, Lyndell, and Duke head to Seattle to hopefully clear his name and free her of her stepfathers plans, they soon fall in love. Now only time will tell if they can find the end of the rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rainbows End&lt;/i&gt; is a coming-of-age tale about two runaways and their canine friend as they embark on a brave quest to uncover the truth and hopefully find the happiness they have always desired.&lt;/p&gt;" />
