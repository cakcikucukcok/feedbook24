        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Lucas Halliday saw Reba Grant for the first time in months, he was in for a shock: Reba was pregnant–with &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; baby–and she&#39;d just gone into labor!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reba couldn&#39;t believe it–this baby was coming way too early. And Lucas was hardly supposed to be her birthing partner. For she&#39;d thought–and feared?–that she&#39;d seen the last of the billionaire businessman, despite all that had happened between them.

And that gave her hope–that maybe Lucas had potential as a husband, too….&lt;/p&gt;
