  <title>Passionate Encounters - Shireen Jabry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why he behaved the way he had? Why he seemed on one day cold and distant, and the other totally in love with you? Why he makes you feel special one moment and crap the next? Why the man that you love is the same man that can make you feel as if you&#39;re on top of the world and buried under it the next? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of all, have you ever really really wondered, why until today you haven&#39;t found the right man? Why you go on one experience after the other, in trial mode and you still have not struck it right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that experiences help shape who we are, but when is &#39;enough&#39; really &#39;enough&#39;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set as film in progress, enter the author&#39;s mind and journey to explore all the mishaps, delusions, ecstasy, lust, love and tenderness as it lends a hand to help us discover a part of ourselves that we have long forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, &lt;i&gt;Passion&lt;/i&gt; is the only thread that ties us altogether.&lt;/p&gt;" />
