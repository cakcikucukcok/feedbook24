  <title>The Unlikely Inheritance - Dale Cahoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah Parker hears a knock at her door only to find a box wrapped in brown paper. As she reads the letter and the looks at the items she finds inside and soon realizes that her birth mother, who has passed on, is not the same as the couple who adopted her and raised her. She continues to read the story included that tells of her birth mother&#39;s trials and why she gave her up. She then tells of her father, how they met, and how they fell in love. Her father is from a rich banking family in New Orleans who traveled with a musical production company that ended up in Salt Lake City where the two of them met. Sarah, a school teacher, decides to see if she can find her father and arranges to travel to New Orleans. What she doesn&#39;t realize is that she is entering into something that will threaten her life and help her understand a world of greed and deception. This story will make you laugh, cry and feel the emotions of true family love. Will Sarah ever find her father who has been locked away by his family. Will she fall in love with Coby, the handsome lawyer who seeks to help her? A great read for anyone over 10 years of age, full of action, comedy and suspense which you will have a hard time putting down once you open the cover." />
