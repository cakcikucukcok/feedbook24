  <title>Emma&#39;s Secret - Barbara Taylor Bradford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The legendary Emma Harte, heroine of&lt;/i&gt; A Woman of Substance&lt;i&gt;, returns in&lt;/i&gt; Emma&#39;s Secret&lt;i&gt;, a novel that showcases the storytelling power of Barbara Taylor Bradford.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paula O&#39;Neill, beloved granddaughter of Emma Harte and the guardian of her vast business empire, believes that everything Emma left to the family is secure. However, beneath the surface, sibling rivalry and discontent flare. Linnet and Tessa, her daughters, are as different as two women can be. One of them wants desperately for the empire to be hers but has a devastating secret that may put her very life in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into this volatile mix walks Evan Hughes, a young American fashion designer who is looking for Emma Harte. But Emma has been dead for thirty years. And Evan bears an uncanny resemblance to Paula O&#39;Neill. Troubled by Evan&#39;s presence, Paula turns to her grandmother&#39;s recently discovered wartime diaries to find the truth, and Emma comes vividly back to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decades fall away. It is London in 1940: the Blitz. Emma, working hard under war-time conditions, is also holding her family together as bombs drop, sirens wail, and her sons go off to war. While she struggles with grief, her indomitability, willpower, and strength come to the fore. As the pages unfurl, Paula discovers the secret Emma took to the grave to protect others, a secret whose repercussions inevitably change lives and may shake a dynasty to its very foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Emma&#39;s Secret&lt;/i&gt; is vintage Barbara Taylor Bradford. Emotion, drama, suspense, intrigue, and passion fill the pages in a spellbinding novel that only she could write.&lt;/p&gt;" />
