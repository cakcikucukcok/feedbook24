  <title>Blue Smoke and Murder - Elizabeth Lowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jill Breck was just doing her job as a river guide when she saved the life of Lane Faroe, son of two of St. Kilda Consulting&#39;s premier operators. But when a string of ominous events&amp;#8212;including a mysterious fire that kills her great-aunt and a furor in the Western art world raised by a dozen Breck family paintings&amp;#8212;culminates in a threat to her life, Jill reluctantly calls in a favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zach Balfour works part-time as a consultant for St. Kilda. His expertise is gathering and analyzing information from unlikely and often dangerous sources. Though he&#39;s got the skills to be a highly effective bodyguard, being a bullet catcher isn&#39;t his preferred way to spend time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting Jill will take him into familiar territory&amp;#8212;among a strange, savagely competitive bunch of collectors who&#39;ll do anything to stay at the top. But Jill is in deeper waters than she&#39;s ever known; as she soon discovers, the perils of running wild rivers are tame compared with the hidden dangers in the high-stakes game of art collecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the cozy rooms of the Breck homestead cabin to the cold multimillion-dollar galleries of the Western art circuit, Zach and Jill must race against time to unmask a ruthless killer hidden in a blue smoke of money, threats, lies, and death. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
