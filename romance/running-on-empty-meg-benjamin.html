  <title>Running On Empty - Meg Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ronnie Ventura has every reason to distrust Fairstein Productions: she&#39;s had run-ins with their shows before. But Fairstein&#39;s newest reality show offers Ronnie a chance to redeem herself from looking like a blonde bimbo. All she has to do is win a modified triathlon. Simple, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except this is Fairstein, and nothing is ever simple with them. Ronnie&#39;s boss at the Blarney Stone bar and café, owner Ted Saltzman, is a lot less convinced that another Fairstein show is just what Ronnie needs, particularly when he&#39;s head over heels about Ronnie himself. But she&#39;s determined, and he&#39;s a man in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted becomes her running coach, which fans their budding romance to a fever. But can Ronnie&#39;s newfound confidence stand up to the usual Fairstein plots? And can Ted find a way to keep his true love in Salt Box if Hollywood tries to steal her away again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Salt Box trilogy is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Book #1: Finding Mr. Right Now&lt;br&gt;Book #2: Love in the Morning&lt;br&gt;Book #3: Running on Empty&lt;/p&gt;" />
