  <title>Hard Justice - April Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A DATE WITH DANGER  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As the first female operative at Alpha Security, Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Sparks has her work cut out for her. Sure, she can wrestle a man to the ground and hit a target at 200 yards with the best of them. But sometimes, being surrounded by all that testosterone can drive a woman to distraction-especially when that distraction is six-and-a-half feet of cocky, confident, Alpha-trained muscle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ex-SEAL commander Vince Franklin has been on some of the most dangerous missions in the world. But pretending to be Charlie&#39;s fiance on their latest assignment in Miami is his toughest challenge yet. Vince and Charlie are like oil and water; they just don&#39;t mix. And when their fake romance generates some all-too-real heat, Vince learns that Charlie is more than just arm candy. She&#39;s the real deal-and she&#39;s ready for some serious action." />
