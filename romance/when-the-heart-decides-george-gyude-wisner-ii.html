  <title>When the Heart Decides - George Gyude Wisner Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;When Sarah Lawsons father is rescued from the claws of death by David Saye, a notorious rebel commander, she believes it is simply a miraculous coincidence. It isnt long, however, before Sarah realises that behind this extraordinary intervention is Davids wish to lure her into his arms.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He is handsome, educated, and generousall qualities that ignite the fires of her heart. But they are from very different worlds. Sarah is the daughter of a respectable middle-class family, while David has been accused of gruesome atrocities. As the heat of the Liberian civil war casts waves over them all, Sarah faces a three-front battle of her own. Despite her feelings, she must contain Davids advances, preserve her familys integrity, and prevent her heart from betraying her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;When the Heart Decides&lt;/i&gt;  is a story of the triumph of love over adversity and of the strength of the heart that seeks love even in the midst of one of the worlds bloodiest civil wars.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;A classic African epic that recounts the realities of war with a dash of romance and Christianity.&lt;/P&gt;
