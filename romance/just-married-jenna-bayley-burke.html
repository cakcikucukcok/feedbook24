  <title>Just Married - Jenna Bayley-Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They&#39;re best friends with benefits, but when Callum needs a wife to inherit his family fortune, their casual arrangement becomes a marriage of convenience... and then so much more in Jenna Bayley-Burke&#39;s sexy standalone romance, &lt;i&gt;Just Married.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle attorney Miranda Rose arrives in Las Vegas determined to keep her best friend-with-benefits from making a costly mistake - marrying some stranger just to save his family trust. But once there, Miranda discovers she&#39;s the surprise bride! One red-hot honeymoon later, they&#39;re back to their over-scheduled lives on opposite coasts. But a marriage of convenience with regularly scheduled sexytimes turns complicated when Miranda gets the shock of a lifetime: she&#39;s pregnant...with twins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda has always wanted a family of her own, but her infertility made it impossible. Besides, Callum&#39;s difficult upbringing places him adamantly in the no-kid zone. Now she must decide between the man she&#39;s been in love with for years and the children she&#39;s longed for. Or will Callum surprise her yet again and come through when it matters most?&lt;/p&gt;" />
