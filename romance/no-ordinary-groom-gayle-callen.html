  <title>No Ordinary Groom - Gayle Callen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No Ordinary Engagement &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miss Jane Whittington&#39;s hopes have been dashed. She&#39;d always imagined herself marrying someone daring, adventurous, exciting. Instead, the man her father has betrothed her to is...a fop! Certainly William Chadwick is devastatingly handsome, but Jane could never love a dandy who cares for nothing save the latest fashions. So why does his heated gaze enflame a desire in her that she&#39;s never known? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Ordinary Love &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work as a British spy has kept William apart from proper society for years -- and he has no idea that his latest &amp;#8220;disguise&amp;#8221; is anything less than appropriate. Now that he longs for a simpler, safer lot, he believes he&#39;s found his ideal bride in this irresistible beauty. But it will take a special sort of seduction to win Jane&#39;s heart. And when the Crown calls him back into service, how can William refuse -- even if it costs him the peace he covets...and the woman he can no longer live without? &lt;/p&gt;" />
