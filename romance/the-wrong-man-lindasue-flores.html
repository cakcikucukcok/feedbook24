  <title>The Wrong Man - Lindasue Flores</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five-year-old Victoria Roberts has a bright future ahead, one that is filled with possibility. Her first year as an elementary school teacher was rewarded with a new teaching contract, and she is planning the wedding of her dreams and a wonderful, romantic Caribbean honeymoon cruise with her soon-to-be husband, Rene. Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But behind all the promises of happily ever after, a dark storm brews in the young brides future. Renes life is cloaked in secrecy, and Victoria is too in love to acknowledge the red flags. It seems that Rene and an accomplice are secretly plotting her death, and his wedding present to himself is a million-dollar life insurance policy on his new bride. Rene has carefully planned out every step in order to get his hands on the insurance money. Unknown to Victoria, her groom has no intentions of spending even one night with her on the cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one heartbreaking moment of discovery, Victoria learns the truth about her fianc. With the help of Todd Morgan, a man she meets while boarding the ship, she plans her escape. But even if she has evaded Renes plans for her on the cruise, will she be able to escape his revenge?&lt;/p&gt;" />
