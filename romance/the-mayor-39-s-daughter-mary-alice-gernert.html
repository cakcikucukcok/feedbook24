  <title>The Mayor&#39;s Daughter - Mary Alice Gernert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Baby Boomers Beware. This novel is especially for you and your parents. It may change your concept of their life experiences and yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is pure fiction. The author pulls out every stop to keep the reader turning pages, with loads of love, hate, desire, revenge, jealousy, and passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background music is supplied by the Great Depression, World War II, Washington Politics during Harry Trumans  Administration, with Bess and Margaret in the White House, and most importantly, West Points challenges for the cadets and their sweethearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a rough ride for Laura Jackson and Bill Bentley who fell in love in college. They knew they were meant for each other. She was the girl of his dreams. She believed that sexual intercourse would take place after the wedding bells sounded loud and clear. He wanted her for his wife, his partner for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their love was secure until Bills serious problems at West Point interfered with writing to Laura, who was still a student at Brown State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake Laura made was worse. It was a deadly one that changed everything. They had to go in different directions. The bright flame of love in their hearts was reduced to embers. But it refused to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, when both were married to others, they were blackmailed and falsely accused of infidelity and murder. They were forced to work together, with the police, in order to catch the criminals red-handed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
