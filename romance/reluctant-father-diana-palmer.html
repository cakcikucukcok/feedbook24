  <title>Reluctant Father - Diana Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;New York Times bestselling author Diana Palmer brings readers back to the range with a reader-favorite tale of love, family and cattlemen!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blake Donavan has one nemesis—love. He&#39;s spent so many years building a wall between himself and the outside world that he doubts anyone could ever thaw the ice around his heart. But he gets the surprise of a lifetime when a little girl with his green eyes shows up on his doorstep. He&#39;s a daddy! What&#39;s a rancher to do?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Little Sarah is accompanied home by Meredith Calhoun, who isn&#39;t so eager to see Blake. Although she was once a thorn in Blake&#39;s side, Meredith is now a stunningly beautiful woman. She&#39;s spent time away from home and matured, becoming a successful author. But can she melt Blake&#39;s hardened heart to create a forever family with the man of her dreams and his newfound daughter?&lt;/p&gt;
