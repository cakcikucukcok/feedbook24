  <title>A Small-Town Bride - Hope Ramsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amy Lyndon is tired of being the Poor Little Rich Girl of Shenandoah Falls. In her prominent family, she&#39;s the ordinary one - no Ivy League education and no powerful career. But when her father tries to marry her off, she knows it&#39;s finally time to stand up for herself, despite the consequences. Now that she&#39;s cut off from the family fortune, her first challenge is to fight her attraction to her handsome new boss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When Amy shows up looking for work with his landscaping crew, Dusty McNeil thinks there&#39;s no way such a pampered princess will ever get her hands dirty. But as Amy proves him wrong and gets down to the nitty gritty, Dusty&#39;s admiration turns to like, then lust - and then love. But can a high-society woman like Amy ever fall for a man like him?" />
