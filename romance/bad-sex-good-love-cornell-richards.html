  <title>Bad Sex Good Love - Cornell Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stephany Williams is a gorgeous thirty-year-old lab technician from South Philadelphia. After quitting her job, she marries the supposedly man of her dreams, James Pain. Hes a handsome, wealthy black luxury condo owner and treats her like a queen. But Jamess sex performance is the absolute worst, and hes unteachable. While still being married, Stephany accidentally reconnects with a former lover, who is hideously ugly and struggling financially. This rodent by the name of Roy teaches a better-sex class for males and is the best lover shes ever had. Throughout this scorching page-turner, Roy is charming and has a vice grip on Stephanys heart along with her other body parts. James finds out about the affair but wants to stay married, but Stephany makes no haste to rekindle. She offers a devastating proposal for James to first take Roys better-sex class if he wants to continue being married to her. Wow! Stephany is thoroughly advised by her two female friendsJanet, a widow who was married for three decades, and Marcy, a fire-mouthed, midage bachelorette with some pretty interesting views.
Does James lower his ego in order to continue fighting for the love of his life? Or is Stephanys request insanely unreasonable?" />
