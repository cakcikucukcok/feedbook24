  <title>Three Nights of Sin - Anne Mallory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three nights of danger . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her brother was arrested for murder, the ton shut its doors to Marietta Winters. No one would help her save him from the gallows&amp;#8212;no one but Gabriel Noble. In exchange for taking the case, Gabriel requests three favors from the desperate young beauty, and Marietta has no other choice but to make a deal with the sinfully handsome devil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three nights of pleasure . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for clues in the rough underbelly of London, Marietta must masquerade as a shamelessly wanton wench&amp;#8212;much to Gabriel&#39;s delight. But Marietta swears to herself that her passionate moans are just for show. She could never fall in love with such a maddening, arrogant, seductive stranger . . . could she? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three nights of sin . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night after night, she satisfies his wicked cravings. But soon Gabriel wants more from Marietta than just three nights of sin&amp;#8212;and even a sordid secret in his past won&#39;t prevent him from trying to possess her forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
