  <title>A Highlander Walks into a Bar - Laura Trentham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The timeless romance, soaring passion--and gorgeous men--of Scotland come to modern-day America. And the rules of love will never be the same...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isabel Buchanan is fiery, funny, and never at a loss for words. But she is struck speechless when her mother returns from a trip to Scotland with a six-foot-tall, very handsome souvenir. Izzy&#39;s mother is so infatuated by the fellow that Izzy has to plan their annual Highland Games all by herself. Well, not completely by herself. The Highlander&#39;s strapping young nephew has come looking for his uncle...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alasdair Blackmoor has never seen a place as friendly as this small Georgia town--or a girl as brilliant and beguiling as Izzy. Instead of saving his uncle, who seems to be having a lovely time, Alasdair decides he&#39;d rather help Izzy with the Highland Games. Show her how to dance like a Highlander. Drink like a Highlander. And maybe, just maybe, fall in love with a Highlander. But when the games are over, where do they go from here?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Laura Trentham creates a romance that is both extremely sensual and phenomenal.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Fresh Fiction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
