      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ultimate love story began in &lt;i&gt;White Lines, &lt;/i&gt;and now, in this stunning conclusion, Jada and Born come full circle, but not without paying a hefty price in &lt;i&gt;White Lines III: All Falls Down &lt;/i&gt;by Tracy Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the surface, Jada&#39;s life is back on track. She&#39;s battled her demons, her son is a permanent part &lt;br&gt; of her life-and yet, it still feels like she&#39;s on shaky ground. What she really needs to settle her soul is to have Born back in her life-and in her arms-again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But reuniting with the man she loves is proving to be the hardest thing she&#39;s ever fought for. And when a brutal and shocking event tests the foundation of Jada and Born&#39;s resolve, it will take every drop of willpower they possess to stay on top.&lt;/p&gt;" />
