          &lt;strong&gt;Her heart skipped a beat when Alex leaned into the microphone and thanked the band.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His baritone voice sounded even sexier reverberating through the small room. Cara watched in amusement as a small crowd immediately gathered around the stage. Many were women, both young and old, with cameras in their hand, primping and waiting for the perfect photo opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the next few minutes, Alex posed for every picture and signed every autograph. If this is what it’s like to be famous, she’d pass. She was glad the only notoriety she’d ever have was the full-page ad in the Yellow Pages for Beacon House. Cara straightened as Alex slid into the booth next to her. “Why didn’t you warn me about the groupies? I am seething with jealousy over here.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He draped his arm around the back of the booth, and she unconsciously inched closer to him. “There’s no competition here.” He twisted a lock of her hair around his finger and tugged on it playfully. “You’re still my biggest fan right?” She lifted her eyes to his and nodded, wishing inside that he knew, that she had the courage to tell him, just how much of a fan she was.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He laid his hand against her cheek, and she felt his warm breath on her lips. “And I’m yours.” Their lips melted together in quiet intensity, and everything else – their fear, their pasts, and their uncertain future – disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
