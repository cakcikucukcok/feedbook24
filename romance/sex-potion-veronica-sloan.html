  <title>Sex Potion - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s all fun and games until someone loses their soul! In the next thrilling chapter of this erotic misadventure, Kevin discovers that he can still control women&amp;#39;s minds - even without the sex potion! Unfortunately, this carnal power has its price. Can Kevin resist temptation and save his soul, or will this crazy summer end with him enslaved to his unbridled lust?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
My frantic brain searched for something neutral to say, to stave off the wild look in her eye. &amp;quot;I-it smells musty in here?&amp;quot; I said. I was doomed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ms. Phillips yanked me by the shirt. &amp;quot;I rent the cottage, Kevin. You know that. Just like you know I have a fianc&amp;eacute;. Didn&amp;#39;t you listen to anything I told you, during our afterschool chats?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;O-of course I did,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just that, right now, my brain&amp;#39;s a little--I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;For what?&amp;quot; she growled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;For what happened. At the school. Us. Together. I just wanted you so much and--&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I almost lost my job, Kevin!&amp;quot; she said, her voice rising in a hoarse whisper. &amp;quot;There were rumors for weeks! Some of the students already thought I was sleeping with you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; I repeated. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry. But, you didn&amp;#39;t lose your job, right? You&amp;#39;ll be back next year?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, but that&amp;#39;s not the point! You could have told me how you felt, like an adult!&amp;quot; Her face was so close to mine that I felt the cool flecks of spit that fired off her tongue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot; I agreed. &amp;quot;But I was greedy! I...oh, you&amp;#39;ll never believe this, but, it was a magic potion. A sex potion.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ha!&amp;quot; she laughed in my face. &amp;quot;Is that what you tell yourself? That that&amp;#39;s the only way you could get what you wanted?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I choked when she reached between my legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You could have been a good little boy and asked nicely,&amp;quot; she growled. I was terrified, but I couldn&amp;#39;t refuse the warm clutch of her fingers. &amp;quot;You know how bad I want you,&amp;quot; she whispered against my lips. &amp;quot;Why did you have to be so risky? You could have had me anywhere...&amp;quot; Her mouth was hot, and tinged with the spice of whatever she&amp;#39;d been cooking with her fianc&amp;eacute;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;M-ms. Phillips!&amp;quot; I gasped between her ardent kisses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And now Richard&amp;#39;s home,&amp;quot; she groaned. Her nails slid down my chest. &amp;quot;Why do you always do this to me, Kevin? Why do you force me to be so bad?&amp;quot; Her fingers quickly undid the button, the belt, and the zipper on my pants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Whoa!&amp;quot; I shouted. &amp;quot;Cassandra! Stop! This is not what I came here to d--&amp;quot; I shivered when her fingertips brushed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mmm.&amp;quot; Ms. Phillips pulled the glasses off her nose and flung them to her desk. &amp;quot;This is the last time we can do this, do you understand?&amp;quot; She was wearing a beige skirt, and she tugged on it with her fingers until it bunched above her hips. I groaned again when I saw the cute pink and white striped panties underneath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She quickly dropped to her knees. &amp;quot;Promise me you won&amp;#39;t come back,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Promise me we&amp;#39;ll end this, Kevin.&amp;quot; Violet eyes locked onto mine. I thought it was fury that made them shine, but it was lust--always lust. &amp;quot;Promise me you won&amp;#39;t make me be so bad...&amp;quot;" />
