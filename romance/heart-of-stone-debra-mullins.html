  <title>Heart of Stone - Debra Mullins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Debra Mullins introduced readers to the world of the Truthseers in &lt;i&gt;Prodigal Son&lt;/i&gt;. Now the story of the lost Atlanteans continues in &lt;i&gt;Heart of Stone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darius Montana is a Seer. With his gift of empathy, he can see into the hearts of others, both human and Atlantean. When his family comes into possession of one of the legendary power stones of Atlantis, Darius is sent to find the Stone Singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith Karaluros is the last Stone Singer. Manipulated all her life for her rare ability, she is widowed after her husband tried to steal her power for the Mendukati, an extremist group that hunts Seers. Faith wants nothing more than to stay out of this war when Darius comes to find her--just in time to rescue her from being kidnapped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith goes with Darius, determined to do the job and be on her way with the money that can set her up where no one can find her again. She didn&#39;t count on the Mendukati sending a hit man after her. Darius swears he can protect her, but when she discovers he is one of the rare Atlanteans whose powers work on their own kind, can she trust him to keep his word, or is she being used again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
