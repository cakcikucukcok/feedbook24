  <title>Beloved Guardian - M.J. Crook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Beloved Guardian&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While taking a short walk since the evening was cool and quiet, Ted was relaxing and currently not being pressured to prepare for another assignment, hewas surprised by a lovely woman dropping from a tree branch above him, tumbling both of them to the ground and allowing the cat she had been rescuing, to get away.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He was a man, but not a &#39;man&#39;. He was the son of a creature that had the appearance of an Earthman. His mother was from Earth but his father was from far away. He had been raised by the government and now served the government of the United States as a powerful agent in it&#39;s employ. They had tried to copy his DNA to create others with his strength and dexterity but had failed. So he was their greatest weapon against the &#39;Axis of Evil&#39; that spread unrest out there. He longed to be fully human, loved just for who he was, not for what he was; a weapon.&lt;/P&gt;" />
