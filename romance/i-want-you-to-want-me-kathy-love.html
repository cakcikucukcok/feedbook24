Not that she&#39;d admit that to many people. But so many of the psychic&#39;s predictions--about her work, even finding that stray black cat--have already come true.

Sure, she&#39;s gorgeous, but she&#39;s coming on strong, and the last thing the 200-year-old vampire needs is to get involved with another mortal.
