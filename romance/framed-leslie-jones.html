After armed gunmen try to abduct her outside a nightclub, though, it&amp;#8217;s suddenly clear she&amp;#8217;s in &lt;em&gt;way &lt;/em&gt;over her head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delta Force operator Thomas &quot;Mace&quot; Beckett is in Boston awaiting his next assignment when he witnesses an attempted kidnapping. His training forces him to intervene, but then the woman pulls a gun on &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. Mace isn&amp;#8217;t sure what to make of the spitfire holding him hostage, but he quickly discovers that Lark is an innocent pawn in a dangerous game. Someone has framed her for the theft of millions from the mafia, and they want her to pay... in blood, if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only days to find the funds, Lark and Mace scramble to track the real culprit. But their investigation unexpectedly leads straight to the heart of a terrible plot, one that could mean death for thousands. The criminals have stolen something far worse than money... and it&amp;#8217;s about to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
