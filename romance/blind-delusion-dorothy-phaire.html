  <title>Blind Delusion - Dorothy Phaire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Phaires new novel, &lt;i&gt;Blind Delusion&lt;/i&gt;, things are not what they appear to be in this multi-layered psychological thriller of murder, obsession, and romance where a lonely clinical psychologist realizes it can be more frightening to reveal her soul than to face death.&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Renee Hayes is immersed in the lives of people living on the edge while she attempts to hide from her true self. But when Dr. Hayes comes face to face with those harboring their own dangerous agendas, she sees the fragility of her own life. No longer in the prime of her youth, Dr. Hayes feels time is running out for her to find the two things shes never really possessed and has always craved, lasting unconditional love and passion in her life.&lt;p&gt;
This is the story of a womans odyssey in search of her unrecognized source of power and strength. Its about a womans need to be intellectually, spiritually, emotionally, and sexually fulfilled on her own terms. Through her own mirrored lens, Dr. Hayes peers at the reflection of her spiritually-grounded secretary and learns from her triumph over tragedy, not only how to survive but how to gain the courage to go after what she wants without shame or regret." />
