      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avelynn: The Edge of Faith, a stand-alone Viking Romance from author Marissa Campbell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charges of treason, murder, and witchcraft follow Avelynn into exile as she flees England with Alrik. Arriving in Wales, they find refuge among Alrik&amp;#39;s friends in the Welsh nobility. Cast out by his half-brothers, Alrik seeks to regain his honor and earn favor with the gods. When war threatens, Alrik embraces gold and the opportunity for his crew to become mercenaries, aiding the Southern kings in their fight against Rhodri the Great.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Desperate to return home, Avelynn seeks to find a way to prove her innocence, pitting her against Alrik as their desires for the future clash. With battle looming, Avelynn&amp;rsquo;s faith in their relationship is further tested through a bitter struggle with Marared, a jealous lover from Alrik&amp;rsquo;s past. Marared&amp;rsquo;s threats turn deadly, and Avelynn runs afoul of magic and sorcery, causing her to question her beliefs and role as priestess.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When the very friends Avelynn and Alrik had come to trust betray them, Avelynn is captured and Alrik is charged with regicide. The two become separated, a chasm of greed, deceit, and ambition driving them apart. In an act of harrowing faith, Avelynn will stop at nothing to find her way back to Alrik and break them both free from Wales&amp;#39; bloodthirsty grasp.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AVELYNN: THE EDGE OF FAITH is a stand-alone novel and #2 in the Avelynn series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
