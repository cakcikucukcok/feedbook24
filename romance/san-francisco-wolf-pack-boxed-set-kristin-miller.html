  <title>San Francisco Wolf Pack Boxed Set - Kristin Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &quot;falling in love&quot; to &quot;it&#39;s complicated,&quot; &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kristin Miller brings you three, full-length, deliciously hot paranormal love stories with sexy alpha heroes and the strong-willed women who bring these werewolves to heel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Werewolf Wears Prada&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melina Rosenthal worships at the altar of all things fashion. Her dream is to work for the crème de la crème fashion magazine, Eclipse, and she&#39;ll do pretty much anything to get there. Even fixing up the image of a gorgeous, sexy public figure who&#39;s all playboy, all the time. Even if he&#39;s the guy who broke her heart a year ago. And even if Melina has no idea that Hayden Dean is actually a werewolf...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beauty and the Werewolf &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billionaire werewolf Jack MacGrath has almost everything--the respect of his peers, a mansion in San Francisco, a private jet, and fast cars. But without a mate, Jack&#39;s in trouble. Then he sees her. Gorgeous, demure, proud...and his enemy. Isabelle Connelly is werewolf royalty and falling for anyone lesser--to say nothing of a rival pack--would be, er, unseemly. Now she must choose between her duty to her family and her pack...or her perfect fated mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What a Werewolf Wants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Private investigator-and werewolf-Ryder McManus doesn&#39;t believe in marriage. But then he never expected to find his fated mate, Josie, at his best friend&#39;s wedding festivities. When Josie and Ryder are together, the chemistry heats up. While he&#39;s trying to stop the wedding, she&#39;ll do whatever it takes to give the couple a dream day. But the secret he&#39;s trying to expose might just ruin everything...&lt;/p&gt;" />
