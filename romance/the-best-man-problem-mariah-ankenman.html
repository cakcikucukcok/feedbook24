  <title>The Best Man Problem - Mariah Ankenman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lilly Walsh is used to keeping things buttoned-up and aboveboard. After all, the last time she hooked up with someone in a wedding party, it nearly cost her her wedding planning business. Thankfully, those rules don&#39;t apply when she meets a handsome stranger in a hotel bar. One bad pirate joke leads to the best night of her life, but come morning, she&#39;s got a wedding to plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Reid never imagined he&#39;d see the woman who rocked his world last night and then ran out on him ever again. But there she is, planning his best friend&#39;s wedding with the same passion and drive that brought him to his knees. She&#39;s adamant that wedding planner and best man can never mix, but that just means he&#39;s got four weeks to make her see him as more than just a one-night guy. Because he&#39;s itching for more than one night...or five, or ten...&lt;/p&gt;" />
