  <title>Riding the Wave - Bull Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don gave up his lofty middle class lifestyle to park a trailer home on the Oregon coast to pen the Great American novel. Cole is a surfer catching a few waves in front of Don&amp;rsquo;s abode. When the two lock eyes there are more than screw waves twisting about on that beach that day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We sat there and drank our beers in silence, feeling the camper fill with thick sexual tension. Though getting shot down wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of my vocabulary, it didn&amp;rsquo;t mean it couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen. My ego was still in check because I did have a chance to score once I joined the ranks of society again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thanks for the beer, man,&amp;rdquo; Cole said, tossing his beer into the trash and walking out the door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been a good minute before I heard a knock at my door. Slightly bummed by my rejection, I answered the door with a chip on my shoulder, wondering what the fuck he had to say now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I opened the door, and there was Cole standing on my step in his hairy birthday suit with a stout hard-on curving back to the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I was just fucking with you, too.&amp;rdquo; Cole licked his chops as I allowed him to climb back into the camper." />
