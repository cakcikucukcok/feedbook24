  <title>A Man of Faith - Christina Walden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CHANCE LUNDGREN---On the same night he foils a vicious gang rape, Chance Lundgrens life takes a U-Turn for God.  He finds peace, new direction, and romance, while attending a small, Fundamentalist Bible College in rural Northern Michigan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His first assignment is to be the Assistant Pastor of a small church congregation in University Park, Illinois.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He has no place to go but up.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then his one misstep comes back to haunt him, rip his heart out, and destroy his entire life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DEMI SANDOVAL---sweet, friendly, dark-haired, fire-eyed.  Incredibly beautiful.  Innocence violated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
JADE POE---thin, blond, athletic, smart and generous hearted.  She found no contradiction at all between being a feminist and being a faithful Christian wife.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DEACON OLAF BROWNrough-hewn, country-bred.  Retired to a Chicago suburb, in order to spend his remaining days caring for Gods House.  He just liked the Kid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DEAN MARQUETTE---the Pharisee
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PROFESSOR FLOYD URBAN---elderly, short, skinny, a perpetual twinkle in his eyes.  He likes to recite poetry.  His rule of life is to always do the kind thing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
REVEREND PAXTON STONE---He just wasnt right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
BILL WYNN---He considered being the class clown to be a high and  holy calling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DALE MARATINDALE---Like Jesus, he was a carpenter.  Like the ancient Prophet Hosea, he went down to the whorehouse and found himself a bride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CRYSTAL---The Prodigal.  The whore who learned that God knew her last name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CINDY---A little child shall lead them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CREW---If you needed bowl of shrimp, or if you needed  man killed, he was always there to do you a favor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
