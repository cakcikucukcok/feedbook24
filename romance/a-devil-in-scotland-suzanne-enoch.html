  <title>A Devil in Scotland - Suzanne Enoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dawning of desire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1806, Scotland. Wild, reckless Callum MacCreath is in no hurry to become someone&#39;s husband. But when his responsible, steady older brother Ian announces his engagement to their childhood friend Rebecca, Callum makes a startling discovery: he wants the lovely young lass for himself. But it&#39;s too late, and when Ian banishes him for his duplicity, Callum is only too happy to leave Scotland forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...is delicious and dangerous &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1816: Marrying Ian was the practical, logical thing for Becca to do. But once Callum sailed away to America, she missed his rakish charm and lust for life. Now Becca is a widow when a much-changed Callum returns to his Scottish homeland. Will he remember their spirited, fiery connection or does he blame her for his brother&#39;s unexpected death? This time neither of them can deny their scorching attraction. But will their hearts be burned in the blazing heat of scandal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&quot;It&#39;s time to fall in love with Suzanne Enoch.&quot; --Lisa Kleypas&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Steamy and bubbling with humor, a scrumptious tale to begin her No Ordinary Hero series.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Booklist &lt;/i&gt;(starred review) on &lt;i&gt;Hero in the Highlands&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
