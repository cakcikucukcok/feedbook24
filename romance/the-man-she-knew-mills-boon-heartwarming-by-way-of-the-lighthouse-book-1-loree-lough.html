  <title>The Man She Knew (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) (By Way of the Lighthouse, Book 1) - Loree Lough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Don’t they both deserve a second chance?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fourteen years ago, one reckless act cost Ian Sylvestry everything, including the girl he planned to marry. Since then, he has fought hard to turn his life around. Returning to his Baltimore town after serving a prison term was the first step. Winning back Maleah Turner’s trust is a far more daunting challenge. From their first sparks-flying reunion, it’s obvious they still have powerful feelings for each other. In fact, they might be even stronger together now. But if their second chance is going to work, Maleah has to believe that Ian is a changed man. She really wants to believe…but she simply isn&#39;t convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
