      <meta name="description" content="Sidney Mason is a hard-edged espionage novelist who is as gritty and self-reliant as the great-grandmother who raised her. When Mattie Mason dies, Sidney drives herself even harder to mask her grief.
&lt;P&gt;Steven Wade, Sidney&#39;s literary agent, fears his top writer is headed for a mental meltdown and urges her to hire an assistant. Enter Parker Bannister, wannabe writer and house sitter, whose career as a Postal Inpector abruptly ends the day a lone assailant shoots her in a post office robbery gone awry. Parker easily adapts to Sidney&#39;s home in Fredericksburg, Virginia. &lt;P&gt;Coping with Sidney Mason is another matter. She must supercharge her wits to keep up with the famous writer&#39;s demands. During the ensuing months, the two women discover just how intrisically their lives are connected. Past and present merge into reality when Grammie Mason speaks from the grave and at last reveals the true nature of a great-grandmother&#39;s legacy." />
