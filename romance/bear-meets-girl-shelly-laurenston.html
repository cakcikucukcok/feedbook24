He&#39;s also about to get trapped by own his game.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lou Crushek is a reasonable, mellow, easygoing kind of guy. But once someone starts killing the scumbags he works so hard to bust, that really gets under his fur. Especially when that someone is a curvy she-tiger with a skill set that&#39;s turning Crush&#39;s lone-bear world upside down--and bringing his passion out of hibernation.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a member of an elite feline protection unit, Marcella Malone has no problem body-dropping anyone who hunts her kind. But Crush is proving one major pain in her gorgeous tail. The only reason she&#39;s joined forces with him is to track down the wealthy human who&#39;s got her entire species in his ruthless sights. It sure isn&#39;t because Crush&#39;s stubborn and contrary attitude is rubbing Cella in all the right ways.  .  ." />
