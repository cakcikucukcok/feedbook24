      <meta name="description" content="Justin was a Nephlium. His father was an angel and his mother human. His race was often referred to as light warriors. Justins race was the stuff of myth and legends and most beings believed that they did not exist. 
They will be born with several unique talents and abilities, one of which will be a shield around their souls which will hide their gifts, talents and abilities from angels, demons and humans. These warriors of light will walk among each race unknown and unseen until they need or choose to reveal themselves. 
Every one is operating under a misconception because they believe or assume that the battle of good and evil will be some epic future battle. Only the battle rages now; as we speak it is being fought, won or lost within each human soul. 
Justin was given a new and urgent assignment: a crossroads soul. These rare beings hold a great amount of power and could be an asset to either side.  Justin was shocked beyond belief to find that this new crossroads soul was his mate." />
