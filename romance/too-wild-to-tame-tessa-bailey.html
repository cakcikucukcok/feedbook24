But at night, behind bedroom doors, the tie comes off and the real Aaron comes out to play. Mixing business with pleasure got him fired, so Aaron knows that if he wants to work for the country&#39;s most powerful senator, he&#39;ll have to keep his eye on the prize.

Yet while Aaron&#39;s presence reminds her of a past she&#39;d rather forget, something in his eyes keeps drawing her in. Maybe it&#39;s the way his voice turns her molten. Or maybe it&#39;s because deep down inside, the ultra-smooth, polished Aaron Clarkson might be more than even Grace can handle . . ." />
