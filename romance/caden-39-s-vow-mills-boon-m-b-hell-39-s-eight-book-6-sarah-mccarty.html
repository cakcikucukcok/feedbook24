  <title>Caden&#39;s Vow (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Hell&#39;s Eight, Book 6) - Sarah McCarty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;His past has haunted him for a lifetime…but one woman could be his salvation&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gunslinger Caden Miller&#39;s compadres are becoming a bit too domesticated for his liking. So he’s off to Kansas territory to carve out a living and a space of his own—alone, just the way he likes it. Maddie O&#39;Hare has been drawn to Caden ever since she escaped to the Hell&#39;s Eight compound from the brothel where she was born and raised. And she’s not ready to let him go so easily…until she’s captured by his new neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Caden discovers that Maddie is being held against her will on a nearby ranch, he demands they release his fiancée. As surprised as Caden is by his own lie, Maddie&#39;s grateful kiss holds a fiery promise that’s far more unexpected. But with old enemies catching up with him, Caden and Maddie will face a danger that tests their passion—and will either bind them together forever or break them apart for good.&lt;/p&gt;
