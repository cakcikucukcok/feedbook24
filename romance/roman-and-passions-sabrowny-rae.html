  <title>Roman and Passions - SaBrowny Rae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the past five years, Special Agent Roman Allan of the FBI has been stumped knowing that his most famous serial killer case was wrong. He knew then and now that the murderer Lipstick was still alive somewhere in the world. After many attempts to find her to bring her to justice, Lipstick returns to his life to start again where she left off. Only this time, Roman is determined to take her down by any means necessary. Roman will keep you on your toes from beginning to end with the many twists and turns of the hunt for justice and the games of a sociopath. Then when you think you got it, Roman will twist your reader nerves into a knot. 
Once you have caught your breath and ready to take another literary ride of the century, SaBrowny Rae brings you Passions. Journalist Thea James is given the story of a lifetime. She will get to write the life story of Father Brady Phillips, who happens to be on death row for the serial murders of twenty-three people. No one can believe that this great humanitarian could be convicted of such a heinous crime. As with all her novels, SaBrowny Rae will have your readers emotions in the wind until you crash and burn at the very end.
Come join SaBrowny Rae as she invites you to meet her at the back door." />
