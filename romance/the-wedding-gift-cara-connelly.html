      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s the New-Jan-Plan? Discover the answer in Cara Connelly&amp;#39;s newest Save The Date Novella, and see how mousey Jan Marone gives herself the gift of living, laughing, and finally loving &amp;#8230; all under the hot Key West sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d come to Key West for a wedding, only to discover the hotel had messed up her reservation. So although Jan Marone has to share a tiny room with sexy Mick McKenna, it shouldn&amp;#39;t really be a problem. Mick&amp;#39;s her best friend, and he doesn&amp;#39;t think of her &amp;#34;that way&amp;#34; &amp;#8230; or does he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mick McKenna loves hard and plays hard. His thick black hair, chiseled jaw, and hard, muscled body make him irresistible. But when once-innocent Jan walks into his hotel room, Mick can&amp;#39;t believe his eyes. Now she&amp;#39;s wearing a sexy bikini and telling him it&amp;#39;s time for her to &amp;#34;get lucky,&amp;#34; making him protective and tantalized at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worried she might be in over her head, he decides never to leave her side &amp;#8230; and suddenly their hotel room seems smaller&amp;#8212;and hotter&amp;#8212;than ever. Mick&amp;#39;s always been hands-off with Jan&amp;#8212;but has the right woman been under his nose the whole time?&lt;/p&gt;" />
