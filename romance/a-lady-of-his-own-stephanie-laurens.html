Now they&#39;ve banded together to support one another through their most dangerous mission of all: getting married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Charles St. Austell returns home to claim his title as earl, and to settle quickly on a suitable wife as well, he discovers that experience has made him impatient of the young ladies who vie for his attention&amp;#8212;with the exception of Lady Penelope Selborne. Years ago, Charles and Penelope&#39;s youthful ardor was consummated in an unforgettable afternoon. Charles is still haunted by their interlude, but Penny refuses to have anything more to do with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If controlling her heart was difficult before, resisting a stronger, battle-hardened Charles is well nigh impossible, yet Penelope has vowed she won&#39;t make the same mistake twice, nor will she marry without love. But when a traitorous intrigue draws them together, then ultimately threatens them both&amp;#8212;will Penny discover she has a true protector in Charles, her first and only love, who now vows to make her his own?&lt;/p&gt;" />
