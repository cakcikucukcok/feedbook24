          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Sherryl Woods sweeps readers away with a beloved story of falling in love when you least expect it…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stubborn, sexy rancher and single father Chance Adams will do anything to get back his share of the family ranch–even if it means seducing his uncle&#39;s ornery stepdaughter, schoolteacher Jenny Adams. Even if it means marrying her. Even if it means falling in love with her?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jenny always dreamed of finding the perfect man, but perhaps Chance, with his hellion, if lovable, son and his unbending grudge against her family, doesn&#39;t exactly fit the bill. She knew he had a one-track mind, all right–but was it just her imagination, or was he starting to get…derailed?&lt;/p&gt;
