  <title>Alien Mate Experiment - Zenobia Renquist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abducted from her world and dropped onto his, she&amp;#39;s as alien to him as he is to her. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean they can&amp;#39;t have some fun with their differences.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Semeera needs a plan for starting her life over. After divorcing a controlling husband, she&amp;rsquo;s ready to enjoy freedom at last. Too bad she gets abducted by aliens before she can decide her next move.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Captain Kader is an alien warrior trapped in a dead-end assignment where he will never see battle again. There are no more challenges to his life, no chances for glory. And then a dangerous experiment brings him an unexpected visitor who changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are as different from each other as night and day, but those differences only entice Semeera and Kader into finding out just how physically compatible they are. What should have been a little fun causes the resurgence of a disease long thought extinguished.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If Semeera triggered it in Kader, will others succumb? And will the scientists be able to get past Kader to find out? Most importantly, can a&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;beautiful black woman&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;really love an&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;alien male&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;with scales, claws, and a tail?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Title is 69,000 words with an HEA. No cliffhangers. No cheating.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
