  <title>The Man Who Loved Pride and Prejudice - Abigail Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modern love story with a Jane Austen twist...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine biologist Cassie Boulton likes her coffee with cream and her literature with happy endings. Her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice, but Cassie has no patience when a modern-day Mr. Darcy appears in her lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silent and aloof, Calder Westing III doesn&#39;t seem to offer anything but a famous family name. But there is more to Calder than meets the eye, and he can&#39;t get enough of Cassie Boulton. Especially after one passionate night by the sea. But Cassie keeps her distance. Frustrated by Cassie&#39;s evasions, Calder tells her about his feelings the only way she&#39;ll let him-by rewriting her favorite book, with the two of them in the roles of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. It&#39;s up to Cassie to supply the ending...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Loved Pride &amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;This is the liveliest romp through an established tale you&#39;ll find on the romance shelves!&quot; -Best Romance Stories&lt;br&gt; &quot;Smart characters, lovely setting, excellent dialogue and rocking fine writing make this juicy romance a winner.&quot; -Bookfoolery and Babble&lt;br&gt; &quot;One of the best examples of the modern P &amp; P story.&quot; -Queen of Happy Endings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modern love story with a Jane Austen twist...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine biologist Cassie Boulton likes her coffee with cream and her literature with happy endings.
