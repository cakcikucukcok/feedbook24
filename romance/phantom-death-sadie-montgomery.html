  <title>Phantom Death - Sadie Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspector Leroux had witnessed the execution of the Phantom of the Opera. Justice had been served. So he thinks, until letters in a feminine hand arrive, hinting at the curious coincidence of a masked composer, Erik Costanzi, thriving in an Italian opera house and married to the former Parisian Diva, Meg Giry. Driven by outrage and a desire for revenge, the inspector tracks the Phantom to his new home. But there is another ghost from Erik&#39;s past, one who dogs the Phantom&#39;s steps, who sabotages the production of his newest opera, and who threatens the peace he has found with Meg and his family. &lt;/P&gt;
Book IV, &lt;I&gt;Phantom Death&lt;/I&gt;, is the last in the Phoenix of the Opera series. It continues and closes the story begun in &lt;I&gt;The Phoenix of the Opera&lt;/I&gt;, and continued in &lt;I&gt;Out of the Darkness: The Phantom&#39;s Journey&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Phantom&#39;s Opera&lt;/I&gt;." />
