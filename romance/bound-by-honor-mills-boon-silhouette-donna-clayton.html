  <title>Bound by Honor (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Donna Clayton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;DO YOU OWE ME, GAGE DALTON?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His answer, like his vow during their ^unceremonious nuptials afterward, had been, &quot;I do.&quot; Before each other, they&#39;d promised to love and honor, but unspoken was their own pledge. For Jenna Butler had saved this stranger&#39;s life, which bound him to return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And only marriage to a Lenape would grant her custody of her sister&#39;s baby.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;.So Jenna moved into Gage&#39;s ranch house…but not Gage&#39;s bed. A virgin, she&#39;d entered their union without expectations, but breathlessly expectant. Though her hard-bitten husband honored her, he seemed to need the tender loving only a wife could offer. What could be the harm? After all, they had to keep up appearances…&lt;/p&gt;
