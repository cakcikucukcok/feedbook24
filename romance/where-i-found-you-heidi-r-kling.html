  <title>Where I Found You - Heidi R. Kling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After her mother&#39;s plane went missing over the Indian Ocean, seventeen-year-old Sienna Jones gave up everything she loved about living in California. No more surfing. No more swimming. No more ocean, period. Playing it safe, hiding from the world, is the best call. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until her dad throws down the challenge of a lifetime: spend a week with his humanitarian team in Indonesia, working with orphans who lost everything in a massive tsunami.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day they arrive, Sienna meets a mysterious boy named Deni, whose dark, intense eyes make her heart race. Their stolen nights force her to open up and live in a way she thought she couldn&#39;t anymore. When she&#39;s with Deni, she remembers the girl she used to be...and starts to feel like the woman he sees in her.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A woman he wants for his own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gulp&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Deni&#39;s past comes looking for him, Sienna&#39;s faced with losing another person she loves. She can&#39;t do it. Not again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, this time, she has a plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each title in the Sea series is best enjoyed in order:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1 - Where I Found You&lt;br&gt;Book 2 - Where the Sea Takes Me&lt;/p&gt;" />
