  <title>The Millionaire&#39;s Unexpected Proposal (Entangled Indulgence) - Jane Peden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;His marriage of inconvenience...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camilla Winthrop is about to do something she&#39;s never done in her life-she&#39;s about to ask a man to marry her. Not just any man. She hasn&#39;t seen Sam Flanagan in almost five years, after he coldly walked away from a passionate and intense two-week affair. Now Camilla is widowed and desperate...and marrying Sam is the only way she can protect their son. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The son he never knew about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hugely successful attorney in Miami, Sam certainly never expected to see the stunning Camilla come through his door again. Nor can he ignore the desire heating his blood. But after she tells him her situation, Sam is furious. He&#39;ll marry her, but under&lt;i&gt; his &lt;/i&gt;terms. And he&#39;ll take everything, including Camilla in his bed...unless she can find a way to thaw the millionaire&#39;s icy heart once more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
