  <title>Once Upon A Chocolate Kiss (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (Hill Creek, Texas, Book 4) - Cheryl Wolverton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When candy shop owner Samantha Hampton nursed an injured stranger and invited him into her home, she thought she was being a Good Samaritan– after all, it was the least she could do after breaking his foot. Richard Moore&#39; s charm put her at ease and made her heart pound. But Samantha didn&#39; t know that she was aiding the enemy!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Richard Moore had no more control over his attraction to Samantha than he did the fact that his family&#39; s confectionary chain would put Samantha&#39; s small shop out of business. Despite being her competition, Richard had no intention of breaking her heart. Would Samantha forgive him when she learned the truth of his identity… ?&lt;/p&gt;
