  <title>Served Hot - Marie Harte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twelve years ago, geeky Dexter Black blackmailed Maya Werner into a prom date, and she was shocked when she had a good time. But for a strong-willed, hot-tempered artist who&#39;s used to having the upper hand, that night has never sat well with her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast forward to the present, where Maya indulges in weekly wine night with friends and ends up pledging to get revenge on Dex. Except the nerd she remembers has transformed into a hot, sexy Marine who has the audacity to blackmail her again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dex is back in town with one goal in mind: to win the girl of his dreams. His strategy? Keep her off balance enough until she melts into the passion between them. But when a misunderstanding stokes old hurts, Maya backs away, and Dex has to go with a contingency plan: pour on the charm until he gets what he wants--Maya, forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Best Revenge series is a STANDALONE story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;* Served Cold&lt;br&gt;* Served Hot&lt;br&gt;* Served Sweet&lt;/p&gt;" />
