  <title>The Dark Flames - Edward M Malo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vampires are mythological or folkloric beings who subsist by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of living creatures, regardless of whether they are undead or a living person.
        This story begins in Rome.200BC. A Vampire named  Moros relates his tale of becoming an immortal and the life of a cursed vampire.  He also writes of a clan war which is brewing in the cities of Rome and Athens amongst the other vampires.  It is in Rome that Moros finds his true love, an Asian princess named Meeka who was lost in her world in the Jade Palace.
        Meekas father has gone mad and was willing to kill everyone for a son; a heir who would find immortality thru his son.  Though Meeka found solace with Moros, their life together somehow felt incomplete.  This was until a little girl who looked to be no more than five years of age entered their lives. While she did possess the body of an innocent her mind does not belong to a child.
        Tammy is in fact an ancient vampire with many secrets.  She tells the story of her mother and the creation of The curse. Her tale includes assassins, an Egyptian princess and even a twist in time." />
