He was someone who was hard to work with and work for. Yet, everybody around him tried to change him as an attempt to make him easier to work alongside. He refused the help. He was making a dream salary so he didn&#39;t care what other people thought of him. He had long forgotten his past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, he gets a harsh reality check, which puts his career, his life in danger. He&#39;s desperate to save what he had built up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will meet a man that will change his life. Carl gets a second chance at life. He doesn&#39;t know why he is given this opportunity. He realizes he better take advantage of it. This story takes you on that journey. Will he do enough in time to save his career, life and rediscover a life worth dreaming about?&lt;/p&gt;
