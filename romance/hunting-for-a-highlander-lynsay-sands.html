  <title>Hunting for a Highlander - Lynsay Sands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Buchanan brothers have found their brides&amp;#8230;only three more to go &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in this scintillating romance from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Lynsay Sands&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Dwyn Innes feels utterly out of place among the eligible women who&amp;#8217;ve descended on Buchanan Keep, vying for the attention of the last unmarried brothers. She isn&amp;#8217;t long-legged and slender like her sisters, or flirtatious and wily like other lasses. Since her betrothed died, Dwyn has resigned herself to becoming an old maid. Yet a chance encounter with a stranger in the orchard awakens her to a new world of sensation and possibility...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weeks away, Geordie Buchanan returns to find his home swarming with potential brides, thanks to his loving but interfering family. But one lass in particular draws his attention from the moment he spies her climbing a tree. Lady Dwyn is not nearly as plain as she thinks. Her lush figure and eager kisses delight him, as does her honesty. But the real test lies ahead: eliminating a hidden enemy, so that he and Dwyn can seal their Highland passion with a vow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
