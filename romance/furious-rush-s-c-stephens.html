  <title>Furious Rush - S. C. Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Thoughtless series comes a swoon-worthy, enemies-to-lovers romance set in the world of motocross.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Mackenzie Cox has a lot to prove. Daughter of a racing legend, she is eager to show the world that she has inherited her father&#39;s talent in the male-dominated sport of professional motorcycle racing. The last thing Kenzie needs is to be antagonized by her rival team&#39;s newest rider, Hayden Hayes. Plucked from the world of illegal street racing, Hayden immediately gets under Kenzie&#39;s skin. His insinuations that Kenzie is a spoiled princess who was handed her career fuels her desire to win, and much to her surprise, Kenzie soon learns she performs better when she&#39;s racing against Hayden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As Kenzie and Hayden push each other on the track, the electric energy between them &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt; the track shifts into an intense--and strictly forbidden--attraction. The only rule between their two ultra-competitive teams is &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; contact. Kenzie always does her best to play by the rules, but when her team slips into a financial crisis, she has no choice but to turn to Hayden for help. The tension simmers during their secret, late-night rendezvous, but Kenzie has too much to lose to give in to her desires. Especially when she begins to doubt that Hayden has completely left his street life behind... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  LOOK FOR THE NEXT BOOK IN THE SERIES: DANGEROUS RUSH." />
