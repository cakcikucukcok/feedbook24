  <title>The Captain&#39;s Rebel - C.B. Halverson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Land. Power. Influence. Mary O&#39;Malley knows these are the only things that matter in her war-torn country. Determined to win back her ancestral home, she must embark on a journey across the Atlantic disguised as a cabin boy. But her ruse brings her under the control of a dangerous sea captain who demands from her the one thing she will never give--complete and total submission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captain Richard Grant runs a tight ship, and he didn&#39;t claw his way up through the ranks of the Royal Navy to be undone by a headstrong Irish girl hell-bent on jeopardizing his mission and his crew. If she insists on dressing like a man, then she can take his punishments. He demands obedience, but his insatiable need for her leads to a complex game of sex, desire, and dominance not even he can control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Awakened by the passion Grant stirs in her, Mary finds herself falling for the stern captain. But when her false identity leads to rumors of her spying for the French, she must choose between her love for Ireland and the man who commands her body--and her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
