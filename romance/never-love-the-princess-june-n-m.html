  <title>Never Love the Princess - June N.M.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Luke Trigg doesnt wait for anyone. The first girl to push him away is his new employee Laurie Brinkle. Will he ever break her wall of resistance? Surely, once he breaks over the wall, he can forget all about her, same as the others who have fallen so easily into his bed. She offers intriguing rules. The surprising exchange with Laurie leaves him wanting more each time he sees the fascinating Laurie.
Finally, Laurie Brinkle moved on after a bad marriage. Or did she? Relationships are more of an inconvenience, and she sees them as a constant struggle to keep men happy. One man seems to push for more than she is willing to comprehend. Things she has pushed to the far corners of her mind have suddenly been brought front and center. Will it be too late for them if she cant open up completely?" />
