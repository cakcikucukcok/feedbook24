      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Come to Whiskey Creek, the heart of Gold Country!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Join the many readers who’ve fallen in love with Whiskey Creek, the Northern California town created by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Brenda Novak.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;WHEN LIGHTNING STRIKES (the story that started it all)&lt;br&gt;Gail DeMarco left Whiskey Creek to make a name for herself in Los Angeles. Her PR firm has a roster of A-list clients, including the sexy and unpredictable Simon O&#39;Neal. But Simon, who&#39;s just been through a turbulent divorce, won&#39;t cooperate, so she drops him&amp;#151;and he retaliates by taking the rest of her clients with him. Desperate to save her company, Gail makes a deal with Simon. What he wants is custody of his son, but that&#39;s going to require a whole new image. He needs to marry some squeaky-clean girl like Gail, who&#39;ll drag him off to some small, obscure place like Whiskey Creek&amp;#133;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;WHEN SNOW FALLS&lt;br&gt;After growing up in cheap motels, moving from town to town with her sister and mother, Cheyenne Christensen is grateful to be on her own. She&#39;s grateful, too, for the friends she found once her family settled in California. But she&#39;s troubled by the mystery of her earliest memories, most of which feature a smiling blonde woman. &lt;em&gt;A woman who isn&#39;t her mother.&lt;/em&gt; She’s determined to find answers&amp;#151;but things get even more complicated when she lands right in the arms of Dylan Amos, oldest and baddest of the hell-raising Amos brothers. He&#39;s exactly the kind of guy she&#39;s sworn to avoid. But&amp;#133;maybe there&#39;s more to Dylan than she thought. Maybe letting him go would be a bigger mistake.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;WHEN SUMMER COMES&lt;br&gt;One day, Callie Vanetta receives devastating news. She needs a liver transplant. But her doctors warn that, in her case, the chances of finding a compatible donor aren&#39;t good. Determined to spend whatever time she has left on her own terms, she keeps the diagnosis to herself and moves out to her late grandparents&#39; farm. One night, a stranger comes knocking at her door. He&#39;s an attractive and mysterious drifter by the name of Levi McCloud, and he offers to trade work for shelter. Callie figures she doesn&#39;t have anything to lose. He needs a temporary place to stay; she needs an extra pair of hands. Then she realizes she does have something to lose&amp;#151;her heart.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&amp;#133;you&#39;re invited to a wedding in Whiskey Creek in this special bonus novella, WHEN WE TOUCH!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whiskey Creek&amp;#151;a town you’ll love!
