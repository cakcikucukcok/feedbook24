  <title>His Reason to Stay - Jennifer Hoopes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Award-winning wildlife photographer, Elijah Ellis, has come back home due to the tragic accident that killed members of both his and his best friend Tabitha Brodie&#39;s family. Despite their grief, Eli hopes that he and Tabby can pick up their familiar friendship. He&#39;s never forgotten the way Tabby makes him feel--full of hope and a sense of home--but she seems determined to keep him at arm&#39;s length.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabby has always loved Eli. He&#39;s everything she wants in a man. But he left Gatlinburg to make a name for himself outside of his famous family.  Even though there&#39;s no one better to help her through this time, she refuses to be an anchor to a life he never wanted. Not to mention Tabby&#39;s hiding a secret that will change all of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Eli and Tabby spend more time together, he&#39;s determined to show her they could be perfect together. Too bad she&#39;s spent years building her walls against him...&lt;/p&gt;" />
