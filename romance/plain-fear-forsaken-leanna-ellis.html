  <title>Plain Fear: Forsaken - Leanna Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;An intense, powerful novel of love and loss, deception and deliverance.&quot;&lt;br&gt; -Nancy Haddock, national bestselling author of Always The Vampire&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hannah cannot move on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She pines for Jacob, the boy who saved her life when she drowned, bringing her back from the brink of death by breathing life into her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But Jacob is gone now, buried.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Levi&#39;s love for Hannah burns just as strong. But he knows how much Hannah loved his brother Jacob. He also knows the troubling event that took Jacob out of their lives. And he lives with that lie every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when a stranger named Akiva comes to their community, he carries with him two secrets that will change their lives forever: he is in fact Jacob, whom Hannah had lost. And he is now a vampire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When passions stir and secrets are revealed, Hannah must choose between light and dark, between the one she has always loved and the new possibility of love. But it&#39;s more than a choice of passion; it&#39;s a decision that will determine the fate of her soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Praise for Plain Fear: Forsaken&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &quot;This is a haunting, heartbreaking story told with such beauty and intensity, it took my breath away. You don&#39;t want to miss this one!&quot; &lt;br&gt; -Lenora Worth, author of the New York Times bestseller Body of Evidence &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;In a word...captivating. Leanna Ellis creates a world seemingly simplistic but teeming with complexity. Her take on vampires is fresh, dark, and at times heartbreaking. Forsaken is a book you won&#39;t want to miss.&quot; &lt;br&gt; -Elisabeth Naughton, author of Tempted&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Leanna Ellis has written an emotionally powerful story with an unusual twist to the vampire legend.&quot; &lt;br&gt; -Nina Bangs, USA Today Bestselling Author&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;With Forsaken, Leanna Ellis takes readers on a thrilling journey to the dark side of Amish life and beyond. Leanna Ellis&#39;s keen eye for detail, sensitive prose and knowledge of the Amish brings Forsaken to vivid, wonderful life. Forsaken exemplifies the ultimate literary juxtaposition of good and evil, and is made all the more powerful by Ellis&#39;s ability to paint a vivid and realistic picture Amish life.&quot; &lt;br&gt; -Linda Castillo, New York Times bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An intense, powerful novel of love and loss, deception and deliverance.&quot;&lt;br&gt; -Nancy Haddock, national bestselling author of Always The Vampire&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hannah cannot move on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She pines for Jacob, the boy who saved her life when she drowned, bringing her back from the brink of death by breathing life into her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But Jacob is gone now, buried.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Levi&#39;s love for Hannah burns just as strong.
