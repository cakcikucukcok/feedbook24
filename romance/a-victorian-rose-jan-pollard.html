  <title>A Victorian Rose - Jan  Pollard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tragedy strikes Rosie Taylor when her ill mother dies aboard the clipper ship transporting her and her family from England to Australia. Not long after, her father becomes engaged to a passenger on board, a woman to whom Rosie takes a dislike. But growing up in Victoria, amongst some of the passengers who came over on the boat, isn&#39;t so bad, especially after she meets a young boy named Rory. Years later, when her father leaves town, Rosie takes different jobs to make ends meet. Things start looking up when a local river skipper asks for her hand in marriage, but as she&#39;s sailing down the river with him she runs into her childhood friend, Rory, and emotions that weren&#39;t there before come to the surface. Victorian Rose portrays one woman&#39;s life in the Victorian period as she&#39;s faced with lies, secrets, incest and true love." />
