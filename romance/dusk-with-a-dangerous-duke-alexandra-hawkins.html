  <title>Dusk with a Dangerous Duke - Alexandra Hawkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dusk with a Dangerous Duke&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexandra Hawkins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were children when the Duke of Huntsley was introduced to Lady Grace Kearly. The young duke--nicknamed &quot;Hunter&quot;--took one look at his future bride and thought only of escaping his responsibilities to his family. Marriage was for grown-ups and Hunter still had years of skirt-chasing ahead of him. But now the time has come for Hunter to heed the call: if this Lord of Vice hopes to keep all of his inheritance, he&#39;ll have to claim his long-neglected betrothed...&lt;br&gt;With her twenty-first birthday approaching, Lady Grace dreads the thought of marrying the duke she has met only once--especially since he&#39;s grown into a notorious rake who will probably beget his heir and abandon her in the country while he pursues fresh game in London. So when Lady Grace coolly decides to call the wedding off, even Hunter is surprised by his refusal to let her go. Suddenly, the notion of claiming and taming this green-eyed beauty is one challenge he cannot resist...&lt;/p&gt;" />
