  <title>Body and Bone - Ls Hawker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He wants to destroy her reputation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He wants to destroy her life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;He wants to destroy . . . her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nessa Donati used to be a happily married mother with a successful music blog and satellite radio show. But that was before her husband John relapsed on drugs and went missing. That was before he was presumed dead. And before she was framed for his murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a commenter on Nessa&amp;#8217;s blog starts harassing her online, Nessa shrugs it off. Trolls are a part of internet life. But eventually the troll begins threatening her safety and releasing personal details . . . details only her husband would know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Nessa&amp;#8217;s life is dismantled piece by piece, her only option is to find John and put a stop to the lies. But when their son becomes a pawn in his twisted game, she must face a disturbing truth: Maybe John isn&amp;#8217;t tormenting her, after all. But if he&amp;#8217;s not . . . who is? And how far will this monster go to exact revenge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published by William Morrow&lt;/p&gt;" />
