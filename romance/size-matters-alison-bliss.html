  <title>Size Matters - Alison Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The rules of (fake) engagement . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  Leah Martin has spent her life trying to avoid temptation. But she&#39;s sick of low-fat snacks, counting calories, and her hyper-critical mom. Fortunately, her popular new bakery keeps her good and distracted. But there aren&#39;t enough eclairs in the world to distract Leah from the hotness that is Sam Cooper - or the fact that he just told her mother that they&#39;re engaged . . . which is a big, fat lie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Sam sometime speaks before he thinks. So what started out as defending Leah&#39;s date-ability to her judgmental mother soon turned into having a fiancee! Now the plan is to keep up the fake engagement, stay &quot;just friends,&quot; and make Leah&#39;s family loathe him enough to just call the whole thing off. But Sam has an insatiable sweet tooth, not only for Leah&#39;s decadent desserts but her decadent curves. Her full lips. Her bright green eyes. Yep, things aren&#39;t going &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; according to plan. Now Sam has to convince Leah that he&#39;s for real . . . before their little lie turns into one big, sweet disaster." />
