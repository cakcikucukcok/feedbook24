  <title>Unmasked by the Marquess - Cat Sebastian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of Library Journal&#39;s Best Romances of 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The one you love&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Selby is determined to see his sister make an advantageous match. But he has two problems: the Selbys have no connections or money and Robert is really a housemaid named Charity Church. She&amp;#8217;s enjoyed every minute of her masquerade over the past six years, but she knows her pretense is nearing an end. Charity needs to see her beloved friend married well and then Robert Selby will disappear&amp;#8230;forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May not be who you think&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alistair, Marquess of Pembroke, has spent years repairing the estate ruined by his wastrel father, and nothing is more important than protecting his fortune and name. He shouldn&amp;#8217;t be so beguiled by the charming young man who shows up on his doorstep asking for favors. And he certainly shouldn&amp;#8217;t be thinking of all the disreputable things he&amp;#8217;d like to do to the impertinent scamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But is who you need&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Charity&amp;#8217;s true nature is revealed, Alistair knows he can&amp;#8217;t marry a scandalous woman in breeches, and Charity isn&amp;#8217;t about to lace herself into a corset and play a respectable miss. Can these stubborn souls learn to sacrifice what they&amp;#8217;ve always wanted for a love that is more than they could have imagined?&lt;/p&gt;" />
