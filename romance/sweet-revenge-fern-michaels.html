That&#39;s the mission of the Sisterhood, seven women who would do anything to help out one of their clan, especially when it means righting a wrong. And Isabelle Flanders has definitely been done wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her former colleague, the conniving Rosemary, did everything in her power to ruin Isabelle, from framing her for a terrible drunk driving accident to stealing her husband and her architecture firm. Now, Isabelle&#39;s formerly lovely life is in tatters while Rosemary scoops up the spoils. It&#39;s enough to make any friend&#39;s blood boil.
