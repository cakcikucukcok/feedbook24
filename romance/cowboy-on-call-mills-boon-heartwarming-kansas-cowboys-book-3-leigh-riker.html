  <title>Cowboy On Call (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) (Kansas Cowboys, Book 3) - Leigh Riker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;He needs to stop running from his mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cowboy or doctor? Sawyer McCord has been wrestling with that question since he came home to the Circle H after fleeing his remote clinic in the Himalayas. A tragedy there has him doubting his medical skills, but his reception on the ranch has been chilly at best. Sawyer can&#39;t blame his family—or Olivia Wilson, his brother&#39;s ex—for their anger. So why does Olivia&#39;s opinion of him suddenly matter so much? Sawyer has unfinished business here and at his clinic. If he&#39;s ever going to redeem himself, he needs to start by making amends to the one woman who might never forgive him.&lt;/p&gt;
