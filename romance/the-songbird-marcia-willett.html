She senses there&#39;s something he&#39;s not telling her, but she has faith that he&#39;ll fit right in with the eccentric but affectionate crowd at Brockscombe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he gets to know the warm jumble of family who share their lives, Tim discovers that everyone there has their secrets. There&#39;s Kat, a retired ballet dancer who longs to take the stage again; Charlotte, a young navy wife struggling to bring up her son while her husband is at sea; and William, who has tried hard to get over his estranged wife--though it&#39;s much harder now that she&#39;s trying to move into the cottage Tim just occupied. And, even when she&#39;s far away, Tim knows there&#39;s Mattie...beautiful, engaging, clever Mattie. Can Tim open up to her? Would it matter, he wonders, if he did?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcia Willett, the master of the charming country novel, once again weaves the stories of her vibrant, lovable characters into this heartwarming read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
