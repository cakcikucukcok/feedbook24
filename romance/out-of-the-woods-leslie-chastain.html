  <title>Out of the Woods - Leslie Chastain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sophie Nelson is entering the second phase of her life. Long since divorced, she has been on her own for longer than she was ever married; her children are all grown, and shes tired of the corporate rat race. Sophie decides to retire to a small, cozy town in Vermont to pursue her real passion: writing. There, she finds a happy home where she can live alone, surrounded by her work and her words. But things soon take a mysterious turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, she comes home to find a light on in her safe sanctuary. There has been an intruder in her house, and Sophie is reminded that single life for a woman is not always safe. Local authorities tell her not to worry, but the murder of her neighbor soon follows the intrusion. The small town, so lacking in crime, is thrown into turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sophie meets Sam Wood, and in spite of the tragedy the two are drawn to each other. Sophie is hesitant to start a romantic relationship, though, what with a murderer roaming the streets. The people of town cannot possibly foresee their villain is someone they know quite well, and Sophie may have to give up a little of her independence to allow herself to be savedbefore she becomes the next victim.&lt;/p&gt;" />
