  <title>Trust in Love - Cherrill Clough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amelia Jane and her two friends left Brisbane for the Gold Coast and a fun time managing to get a three-bedroom apartment opposite Broadbeach on the Esplanade.
They all excel in their chosen careers, and Amelia is a secretary to a young, handsome, up-and-coming solicitor, Patrick, whom she likes, but for all his efforts, he just cant get her to go out with him. However, he introduces her to his best friend, John, a trauma doctor from the Coast Hospital, and it is love at first sight for them both.
Because of the trauma he sees constantly coming from accidents, he has bad times and sometimes is unable to sleep and get through it without the love and care of Amelia, who is always there for him.
The biggest cause of the highway accidents is due to inattention to the road and, of course, road rage and booze, he tells her, and many trucks can be the cause where the drivers use uppers and downers to get through their hectic days. 
 After a wonderful family Christmas day with both families, John and Amelia come across an accident where two cars are badly damaged and one upside down, and they get all the family out with the help of another motorist just before the car bursts into flames. The other car has a deceased lady, and her husband is in a bad condition. They then discover a traumatized boy under the front seat. John took control of everything until the paramedics arrived, and the whole highway came to a standstill for hours.
Sometime later, John and Amelia marry, buy a mansion overlooking the sea, and have two delightful children, and while Amelia is waiting to go back to work after the birth of her daughter, she starts drawing illustrations for the childrens books she has started writing, which become a worldwide phenomenon and changes their lives forever. She decides to help childrens charities from some of the enormous profits from her good fortune.
This is a story of how trusting each other to be there when needed makes such a difference and relays a message for the drivers to slow down. You are driving a lethal weapon." />
