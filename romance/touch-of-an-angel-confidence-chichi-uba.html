  <title>Touch of an Angel - Confidence Chichi Uba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Nora, life is a fantasybut one that is slightly off. Beautiful, brilliant, and rich, and supported by her wonderful family, she still feels something would be amiss in her seemingly picture-perfect life. 
For Ralph, life is also a fantasy, but in a very different way. He dreams that he would one day win Noras heart. He knows it to be an impossible dreamand then, amazingly, she begins to show a little interest. Just when he believes his dream is about to come true, however, another man enters Noras life. He has competition in the form of Ceejay, and Nora seems to lose interest. Ralph is determined not to let her go, thoughnot for any reason in the world. 
For Ceejay, life is about preparation. When he meets Nora, she gives his life meaning again; her presence in his life can best be described as an angelic touch. Although he tries to hide his love for her, controlling how he feels becomes impossible. When his secret is revealed, no amount of planning could have prepared him for what happens nextor the heartbreaking consequences that follow." />
