  <title>Lady Audley&#39;s Secret - Mary E. Braddon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Barrister Robert Audley is suspicious. His friend George Talboys recently returned a rich man from the goldfields of colonial Australia but is shattered to find that the wife he left behind has died. Now George has vanished, leaving only a note saying that he&#39;s returned to Australia. Fearing foul play, Robert attempts an investigation into his friend&#39;s sudden disappearance but his every move is hampered by his uncle&#39;s lovely young bride, Lady Audley, whose placid, doll-like exterior conceals a secret double life of intrigue, madness, and murder. &lt;BR&gt;This 1862 &quot;sensation novel,&quot; a nineteenth-century equivalent to today&#39;s thrillers, established Mary Elizabeth Braddon as the chief rival of the genre&#39;s master, Wilkie Collins. Inspired by a real-life murder, Braddon&#39;s romantic melodrama challenges Victorian notions of femininity and offers intriguing insights into the era&#39;s anxieties about social rank and identity. It&#39;s also a fast-paced, deftly plotted detective story that offers vivid glimpses of life among the English gentry during a bygone age." />
