  <title>A Home for Her Family (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) - Virginia Carmichael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The Millionaire and the Mechanic&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Never in a hundred years does Sabrina Martinez expect to meet someone like handsome millionaire Jack Thorne–let alone find him volunteering at the Denver mission where she works. She&#39;s grown up in a humble home and is surprised an heir to a fortune could have such a kind and generous heart. But Sabrina can&#39;t let anything distract her–not even love. She&#39;s battling for custody of her nieces and there&#39;s nothing more important than that. Jack wants to help, but the divide between him and Sabrina seems impossibly wide. Can they learn to see past their differences, and give themselves a chance at true love–and a real family?&lt;/p&gt;
