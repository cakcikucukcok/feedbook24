  <title>Seducing the Bridesmaid (a Wedding Dare Novel) - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Regan Wakefield is a headhunter in both name and personality: driven, motivated, and unafraid to pursue what-and who-she wants. Naturally, she&#39;s thrilled when her friend&#39;s wedding offers her an opportunity to score Logan McCade, the practically perfect best man. Unfortunately, groomsman Brock McNeil keeps getting in her way, riling her up in the most delicious of ways. But Brock&#39;s smooth southern charm isn&#39;t part of the plan...so how exactly did they end up having searing-hot sex? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regan may pretend the erotic electricity sparking between them is merely a distraction, but Brock knows better. She refuses to see beyond the devil-may-care façade he presents to the world, while he sees straight through &lt;i&gt;hers&lt;/i&gt;. Changing her mind-and getting under her skin-is a challenge he can&#39;t resist. And when he wins, Brock will do whatever it takes to convince Regan that the best man for her is &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Wedding Dare series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Falling for the Groomsman&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jen McLaughlin, w/a Diane Alberts &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baiting the Maid of Honor&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tessa Bailey&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seducing the Bridesmaid&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Katee Robert&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Man with Benefits&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Samanthe Beck&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dare to Resist&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Laura Kaye&lt;/p&gt;" />
