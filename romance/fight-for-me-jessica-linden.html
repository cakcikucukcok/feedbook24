  <title>Fight for Me - Jessica Linden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Raised in the streets, Knox is a battle-worn MMA fighter with no past, present, or future.  Fighting every day just to survive, Knox owns nothing but the pride in his victories and the scars on his hands. When his control snaps and he must flee the city to keep his life, he runs into a stunning woman with the same intent.  All big eyes and delicate features, she&#39;s not cut out to survive on her own.  And when finding her own inner strength leads to a shocking act of violence, Knox knows he must protect her at all costs...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie couldn&#39;t spend another day under her father&#39;s lock and key.  Raised to be the perfect picture of wealth and sophistication, she detests the dark, ugly side of her father&#39;s greed.  Refusing to be held captive by her life a moment longer, she escapes his fortress - and runs right into the arms of the strongest, most dangerous, most desirable man she&#39;s ever met.  As instant attraction leads to explosive passion, Natalie finds she cannot leave his side.  But as their pursuers loom closer and threaten to tear them apart, Natalie and Knox have to decide:  is it easier to stand apart?  Or is a love this strong worth the fight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This intense, sexy novel of action, adventure, and insta-love between a street MMA fighter and runaway heiress will get your heart pounding and your pulse racing! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
