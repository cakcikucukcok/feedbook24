  <title>Can&#39;t Resist a Cowboy - Elizabeth Otto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He&#39;s always been her weakness...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Injured and discharged, Marine Levi Haywood has returned to his family&#39;s ranch to heal and start a new life. After all, once a cowboy, &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; a cowboy. The only problem? Life at the ranch has moved on since he joined the service, and suddenly his role in the family business is much less clear. And things get a lot more confusing when the woman he left behind returns home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carrie Lynn Waite has never known a time when she didn&#39;t love Levi. They were childhood sweethearts, but because of her health, she was forced to move to the city, away from the ranching life. Now Carrie&#39;s come home only to learn her family&#39;s ranch is in trouble and Levi is back, along with an undeniable attraction she can&#39;t resist. But some things never change, forcing Carrie to choose the future laid out before her...or the cowboy she could never resist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
