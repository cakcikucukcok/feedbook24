      <meta name="description" content="Everyone who knows April knows that she has talked about Luke Daniels, her &quot;dream man,&quot; since she was twelve years old. Now her dream has become her reality, and she is living her dreams. A relationship with Luke isn&#39;t the fairy tale that most dream of, but it is the prefect fairy tale in April&#39;s eyes. When Luke met April, he felt an instinct connection to her that could not be denied. He knew right away that April wasn&#39;t like the normal girls he dated. Luke finds himself wanting to protect her, and realizes he cares for her much deeper than he ever thought possible. However, will Luke allow himself to fall in love with April? Will he be able to tell April what he fears most in life? &quot;Forever Mine&quot; was written as a dedication to Richie Sambora, and is the sequel to &quot;One Light Burning,&quot; published in 2011 by Lulu.com. &quot;Forever Mine&quot; may appeal to readers who are interested in romance, and believe that love really does conquer all." />
