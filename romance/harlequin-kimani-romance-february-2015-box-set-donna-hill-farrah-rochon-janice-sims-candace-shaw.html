      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Looking for entertaining stories of drama, glamour and passion featuring sophisticated and sensual African-American and multicultural heroes and heroines? Harlequin Kimani Romance brings you all this and more with these four new full-length books for one great price!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WAY YOU LOVE ME (Lawsons of Louisiana)&lt;br /&gt;Donna Hill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Struggling law student Bailey Sinclair is working two jobs to make ends meet when she encounters Justin Lawson, the richest, most hotly pursued bachelor in New Orleans. All he wants is to lavish Bailey with gifts and his passionate attention. But she&#39;s determined to make it on her own. They may come from different worlds, but is she willing to trust him with her heart?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOREVER WITH YOU (Bayou Dreams)&lt;br /&gt;Farrah Rochon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Widow Leslie Kirkland is starting over with her daughters. But she soon finds herself caught between the community and science-teacher-turned-assistant-principal Gabriel Franklin. A teacher once saved Gabriel from the path to destruction, and now he&#39;s dedicated to his students and his hometown. Can he convince Leslie that it&#39;s time to move on and make a bright future&amp;#8230;with him?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIEF OF MY HEART (Kimani Hotties: Forever My Lady)&lt;br /&gt;Janice Sims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Psychologist Desiree Gaines diagnosed Decker Riley the day they met: he&#39;s a sexy smooth-talker who loves the thrill of the chase. But for the first time since she lost her fianc&amp;#233;, Desiree is intrigued. When Desiree finally steps into his arms, he realizes she was worth the wait. But Decker&#39;s past makes Desiree doubt herself, so he&#39;ll have to earn her trust, one sweet, sizzling kiss at a time&amp;#8230;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOURNEY TO SEDUCTION (Chasing Love)&lt;br /&gt;Candace Shaw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Sydney Chase has been driving attorney Bryce Monroe crazy. No one else combines tough and tender in such a sexy, irresistible package. Though Syd has him pegged as a spoiled brat, a spur-of-the-moment Vegas road trip is Bryce&#39;s one chance to prove otherwise. Yet what happens in Vegas is impossible to forget, and Bryce isn&#39;t letting go until he&#39;s crashed through every single one of her defenses&amp;#8230;" />
