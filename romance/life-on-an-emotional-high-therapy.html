  <title>Life on an Emotional High - Therapy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Id describe this as my book of stimulation in poetry, with experiences of my life for both men and woman to enjoy. In this book I am divulging myself through poetry in a way different from others. Stretching your imagination of what you think poetry is while expressing myself on many different levels. At the same time Ill be giving you a hint at my experiences in conversations and thoughts with others. Just me riding the roller coaster of life screaming and hollering waving my hands and having a good time with writing. All of this while giving you secrets written in my poetry to leave you guessing and wondering, is this about her, her life, her relationships in love, life and marriage? Who was that about? Just making you wonder. So many thoughts in my writing that it will make you wonder about me, wonder about you and your life. &lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All of my writings are from my heart to my pen, with a modest amount of modification and a minuscule amount of proofreading, limited enough to keep my writings as real as possible. In writing straight from your pen its never perfect and sending my book to be professionally proofread  I thought would make my thoughts too unreal, too commercial; take some of my personality or zest out of my book.  I wanted my writings to be as if someone was really speaking through writing. Even if my grammar was terrible, it would be the real me.  The corrections I have done are straight from spell check from my laptop giggle, now we all know how that could be, but I did it anyway.&lt;P&gt;
Ive exposed me and my thoughts in a way that has allowed me to sky rocket to another level, to another me. Ive extended to you Theaology, THE STUDY OF THEA, Thea and the life experiences she has surrounded herself in, along with the joys of living to learn what life really was about and not the just the pretty picture we all want and or pretend it is. My painting of life is an explosion of time, painted in yellows and reds. Colors of laughter and smiles that are to abundant to count. Colors that allow me to stand in the wings of life and spilling it out to you in expression, thoughts and short stores of which will allow you to think twice about your life experiences and enjoy every single moment that god has extended to you.&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Now what I am asking for from each one of you while reading my book is to enjoy my book with an open mind. Dont tear it down too much but read what I have to say and live in the joy of my development of it.
&lt;P&gt;Let me explain briefly some of the chapters in this book. Chapter one is about loves hurts, joys and change that we all can relate to. In reading you will get a picture of what love and life is about, a picture of the happiness, the sadness, the ups and downs and the just plan sick and tired of love. My poetry will express this in every way I could imagine.&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Poetry of love so deep you will need a shovel to recover from it, because it pulls you in and makes you shake your head to say Ive been there. In this chapter there is a poem written in the form of a short story called, An Un-produced Movie of Romance. It is a screen play rewind; yes thats how I am going to describe it. Its the perfect story for the question, where is this love going? &lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Chapter two, well Ive devoted this to the men, its my own unique message for them. My way of saying you are spectacular, even when we dont tell you, you shine. I speak in this chapter as if I am one of the boys. Ive removed that I am woman hear me roar attitude, and Ive learned that I couldnt roar without them as loud as I can now.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this chapter I play with 2 words Ive created, do-luscious and flow. Read it youll see what I mean, nothing but fun thoughts.  My other favorite poem is The Struggle; it has a part one and a part two. Some of the woman who read these 2 poems may find objection to what I have written. But I had to say what I thought a man would say or wanted to say. The Struggle, was written" />
