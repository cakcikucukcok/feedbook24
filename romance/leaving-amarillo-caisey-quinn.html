  <title>Leaving Amarillo - Caisey Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nashville meets New Adult in Neon Dreams, a dramatic, sexy series from bestselling author Caisey Quinn, about a country band&amp;#8217;s rocky road to fame&amp;#8212;and the ambition, dreams, and love of the people who make the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixie Lark hasn&amp;#8217;t had it easy. She lost her parents in an accident when she was young and grew up in a ramshackle house on a dirt road in Amarillo with her ailing grandparents and overprotective older brother. Thanks to her grandfather, Dixie learned to play a mean fiddle, inspired by the sounds of the greats&amp;#8212;Johnny and June, Waylon, and Hank. Her grandfather&amp;#8217;s fiddle changed Dixie&amp;#8217;s life forever, giving her an outlet for the turmoil of her broken heart and inspiring a daring dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, Dixie and her brother Dallas are creating the music they love and chasing fame with their hot band, Leaving Amarillo. But Dixie isn&amp;#8217;t enjoying the ride. All she can think about is Gavin, the band&amp;#8217;s tattooed, tortured drummer who she&amp;#8217;s loved since they were kids. She knows he feels the connection between them, but he refuses see her as more than his best friend&amp;#8217;s little sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that one night with Gavin will get him out of her system, Dixie devises a plan. She doesn&amp;#8217;t know that her brother has forbidden Gavin from making a move on her-a promise he swore he&amp;#8217;d always keep . . . a promise that once broken will unexpectedly change the future for Dixie, Gavin and the band.&lt;/p&gt;" />
