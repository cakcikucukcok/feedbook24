        &lt;h2&gt;Four historical romances to transport you in time!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claiming His Desert Princess&lt;/em&gt; by Marguerite Kaye&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stolen nights with the secret princess…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bound to marry for duty, Princess Tahira finds her only freedom in forbidden escapes to the desert. Then one night she encounters a stranger under the stars – adventurer Christopher Fordyce. He’s wildly attractive and thrillingly dangerous…an illicit fantasy she can’t resist!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even unaware of Tahira’s royal blood, Christopher knows his shameful past makes any future with her impossible. But in the sultry desert heat, desires are uncovered and secrets unveiled, and soon Christopher will risk everything to claim his desert princess!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bound By Their Secret Passion&lt;/em&gt; Diane Gaston&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A forbidden attraction… A hidden desire!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Years ago, penniless Lorene Summerfield wed for duty, giving her siblings the chance to marry for love. But now the generous-hearted Countess finds herself widowed…and the man she’s loved in silence for years is falsely accused of her husband’s murder!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although he closed his heart to love long ago, the Earl of Penford has always found Lorene irresistible. Their newly-ignited passion may be scandalous, but now he’ll stop at nothing to clear his name and win Lorene’s hand!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wallflower Duchess&lt;/em&gt; Liz Tyner&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No other woman will do for the determined Duke…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To Lily Hightower, Edge is still the adventurous boy she grew up with, even though he’s now become the formidable Duke of Edgeworth. So when he doesn’t propose to her sister as everyone expects, shy Lily marches right up to him to ask why…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wallflower Lily is amazed to learn that she is the Duke’s true choice. She’s hiding a secret which, if he found out, could threaten everything. But Lily is the Duchess of his dreams -and Edge is determined to make her his!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captive of the Viking&lt;/em&gt; Juliet Landon&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taken in revenge!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aric the Ruthless is consumed by his need for vengeance. And so he takes his enemy’s widowed daughter, Lady Fearn, as his slave… His fiery captive may fight him at first but he knows he will soon tempt her into his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fearn’s marriage brought her only fear and pain, but powerful Viking Aric is nothing like her cruel husband. And as her captor’s seduction awakens her to new sensations, dare she hope this ferocious warrior could become the husband she deserves?&lt;/p&gt;
