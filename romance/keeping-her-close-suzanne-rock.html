He believes the job is nothing more than glorified babysitting but after one look at the sexy journalist, suddenly, his job is no longer a hardship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attraction between them is immediate, and Tess&#39;s take-charge personality in the bedroom is like a dream come true. Unfortunately, Tess is too wrapped up in her work to take their relationship seriously. When an attempt is made on her life, it will take all of Max&#39;s training to convince her to stop trying to handle everything on her own and stay where he can protect her best--in his arms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
