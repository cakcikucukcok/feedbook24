The first step to feeling alive again is sex. Hot, dirty, black-out-from-orgasm sex. And who better to provide it than the brooding, sexy, tatted bad boy-turned-man she&#39;s known for years? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rion, however, has one stipulation: He&#39;ll be hers only for one night. One night to explore her every fantasy. One night to push her limits.  One night to introduce her to a passion that makes both doubt if it will be enough...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Lick series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Only for a Night&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Only For Your Touch&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Only For You&lt;/p&gt;" />
