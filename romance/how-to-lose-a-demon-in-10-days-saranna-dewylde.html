  <title>How to Lose a Demon in 10 Days - Saranna DeWylde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GOT DEMON?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grace does. She&#39;s got more demon than she can saddle. In fact, she&#39;s got a sinfully sexy Crown Prince of Hell named Caspian. She&#39;s also got ten days to get rid of him or Bad Things shall ensue. See, her Russian mobster ex-boyfriend didn&#39;t take kindly to her smutty Mephistophelean contract. It&#39;s not that she&#39;s conspiring with fiends; that was his idea. It&#39;s that she&#39;s conspiring against him with outrageous devilry that runs the gamut from embarrassing to a dead hooker turned dominatrix demon gunning for his soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One should never trust demons, let alone shag them. They don&#39;t have hearts. Yet Grace is buying hers some slightly tarnished armor and hoping that once he&#39;s been shoveled into it, kicking and screaming, he&#39;ll find it&#39;s just his size. This damsel in distress needs a dark knight for a Happily Ever After.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Grace + Caspian = LOL demonic lovin&#39; fun!&quot;&amp;#8212;Dakota Cassidy, author of The Accidental Series&lt;/b&gt;" />
