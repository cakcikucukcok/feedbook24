  <title>Shambhala: Messages Across Time - Marta Martín Girón</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The road and the destination, in general, are uncertain. You don’t know what can happen from minute to minute, but through the years, one understands that everything happens for a reason. That was how, overnight, I realized that everything I had experienced in my life also had a very specific purpose: to meet with them in a conscious way. Now, the dreams I’d had since childhood would make sense. Now, those lights would have a meaning. They were waiting for me, and now I had to make a decision. Would I be ready to handle their message? Would I dare to try a closer contact with them? Would I be brave enough to enter the ‘lost city’?&lt;br/&gt;
My soul had recognized the call.&lt;br/&gt;
Shambhala was waiting for me.&lt;br/&gt;
And you—have you felt the call?&lt;br/&gt;" />
