  <title>Canyon Road - Thea Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sage Elgin has lived with her wealthy, powerful, beautiful, and selfish Aunt Victoria since she was twelve, when her anthropologist parents&amp;mdash;her mother, a Zuni Indian, and her father, Aunt Victoria&amp;rsquo;s brother&amp;mdash;were killed in an airplane crash on their way to a dig-site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now, while still in deep mourning three weeks after her Aunt Victoria had died in a horseback riding fall, Victoria&amp;rsquo;s attorney tells Sage that Victoria had squandered away her fortune, and Sage is left with virtually nothing to live on.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Trying to escape her grief and worry for at least couple hours by attending an art reception, Sage leaves early and drives home on the lonely Silverado Canyon Road. As she nears her driveway, a motorcycle gang roars up on her, encircling her car and forcing her into the ditch.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Right at this terrifying moment, Michael Williamson crests the country hill and the motorcycle gang roars away. Michael maneuvers Sage&amp;rsquo;s car out of the ditch, and, as she&amp;rsquo;s still shaking, he drives her up her long driveway.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Sage thanks Michael for saving her, and invites him in for a cup of tea. They chat amiably, each taking veiled glances at the other&amp;rsquo;s beauty, but after Michael leaves, Sage finds she can&amp;rsquo;t get his boyish gorgeousness and good-nature out of her mind. She tells herself she&amp;rsquo;ll never see him again, little knowing how soon their paths would again cross.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; No matter how far away from one another two people who are meant to be together try to run, they will eventually run into one another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Love is a circle....&lt;/p&gt;" />
