  <title>Unmailed Letters to a Married Woman - Art Noble</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme parks today build these monstrous roller-coasters &amp; give them intimidating names like &quot;Cyclone,&quot; &quot;Hurricane&quot; &amp; &quot;Colossus.&quot; They scare you &amp; ask you to test your courage for their ride. Well, if they really wanted to scare you with the most terrifying &amp; awesome experience in human life, they should name their ride &quot;Love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNMAILED LETTERS is modern, blunt &amp; powerful. The book is about a woman struggling to extricate herself from a drug abusing husband &amp; the man who falls in love with her. It is not a book for everybody. Millions of us have had what we believe to be great loves; ecstasy we&#39;ve never known before only to sink into loss&#39;s despair. So, UNMAILED LETTERS is informally divided into three parts: pursuit, capture &amp; loss/recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuit is fraught with both great expectation &amp; frustration with those expectations unmet. Ups &amp; downs, just like everybody else&#39;s relationship. Capture is best described by the line in the book, &quot;I haven&#39;t written much poetry lately. I feel like I&#39;m living it.&quot; One critic called the book&#39;s poetry &quot;a portrait of the male psyche.&quot; It is the recovery portion that makes this book valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mona Golabek, host of NPR&#39;s The Romantic Hours said of the poem, Human Experience, read on her program the week of Sept. 23, 2002, &quot;It was so moving, such a testament to the human condition, to love &amp; loving, to desires &amp; longing. I thought it was exquisite.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say the book is not for everybody. New writers are pests! We seek validation for our work, first from friends, then acquaintances, then everybody we meet. &quot;Read this. Tell me what you think.&quot; From some, the book triggered uncomfortable feelings from their own experience/the lives of their friends, &amp; had to put it down. Others got as far as the pain in recovery - &amp; recovery is painful. Those who finished it found new hope. The book, &amp; life for those who face it, has a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall we step on the roller-coaster?&lt;/p&gt;
