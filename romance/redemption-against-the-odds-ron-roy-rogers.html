  <title>Redemption Against the Odds - Ron Roy Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of Ron and his struggle to come to terms with the spectacular disintegration of his marriage and, ultimately, life as he knew it. 
Ron, a successful businessman, believes that his life is idyllic and knows that his wife and children want nothing, but he is brought to question everything he holds true when his wife embarks upon a self-destructive spiral involving infidelity, drinking, and, ultimately, drugs. 
Her increasingly erratic behavior threatens to destroy the whole family. Ron finds an unlikely ally in an old friend who is going through a breakup of his own. The two men gravitate toward each other and embark upon a series of misadventures, which serve as a timely distraction from the mess or their respective relationships. 
Eventually, after putting herself and the family through their own private hell, Rons wife takes the ultimate curtain call and ends her own life, leaving the family to pick up the pieces again! 
This story chronicles the grieving process not only of her life but also of the end of a family and then the rebuilding that inevitably follows. This is a story of how a man clings to his friends, his children, and his hope in order to come out of the other side. He emerges battered, scarred, and world-weary but still standing and able to rebuild his shattered life not only for himself but also for his children. 
This short book is a painful but often colorful and funny read, which is worth the effortespecially if you think that all hope is lost. It is a tale of redemption against the odds!" />
