  <title>Secrets Of The A-List Box Set, Volume 2 (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Helen Lacey, Michelle Major, Yahrah St. John, Cat Schield</title>

        &lt;h2&gt;Discover their red-hot secrets!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Helen Lacey&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sex, scandal and yet more secrets! Whether it&#39;s pre-wedding shopping in Paris for Elana and Rafe, or the arrival of backstabbing drama queen, Aunt Ana – tensions are running high all round. The rehearsal dinner should be a night to celebrate romance. Instead, Mariella is missing in action, a surprise guest is slipping through the crowd, Luc is fending off blatant requests for a ring from Rachel . . . and the Fixer is scrambling to keep all Marshalls on message…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The wedding is almost upon them. The venue is perfect, the dress is divine…so why are Elana Marshall’s feet so mightily chilly?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Major&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Better whet those appetites— Mariella Marshall’s children are coming for their weekly family dinner, only this menu is complete with a juicy side of drama. And nobody does drama like Mariella’s backstabbing sister, Ana. But of course, every good hostess knows to save the best for last—and this supper of secrets is no exception. The Marshalls had better leave room for dessert, because there is one more shocking dish they won’t want to miss!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Yahrah St. John&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elana and Thom’s rehearsal dinner should be a night to celebrate romance. Instead, Mariella is missing in action, a surprise guest is slipping through the crowd, Luc is fending off blatant requests for a ring from Rachel . . . and the Fixer is scrambling to keep all Marshalls on message! Seductive distractions loom large for everyone tonight—but are any of them dangerous enough (or sexy enough!) to derail the wedding?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Cat Schield&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The venue is perfect, the dress is divine, but Elana Marshall’s feet are looking mighty chilly. And she’s not the only Marshall with doubts. Rachel may be perfect on paper, but the heart wants what it wants, and Luc can’t decide if his wants her. Decisions, decisions. With guests arriving and the Marshalls’ reputation on the line, will the happy couple get hitched without a hitch?&lt;/p&gt;
