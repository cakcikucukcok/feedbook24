  <title>Getting It Right - A.M. Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detective Nathan Wolf might just be a junior detective, but he tackles every case with the passion that he lacks in his personal life. A series of failed relationships with women has left him still single at thirty-four&amp;#151;because he&#39;s too scared to admit to his longtime crush on his best friend James.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Dr. James Taggert likes to keep his profession as a psychiatrist separate from his party-animal persona. Known around the gay clubs as &quot;Tag&quot;, he&#39;s the guy who screws them, leaves them, and never looks back. But James&#39;s drinking is getting heavier, and when bad memories from the past resurface, he&#39;s close to becoming the worst version of himself.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;After a drunken blackout ends in a hot and heavy make-out session with his very straight best friend, James has no memory of the steamy affair. But Nathan isn&#39;t sorry for the kisses that James can&#39;t remember. Nathan finally musters the courage to tell James how he really feels, but a life-altering event might force them apart before they can ever be together.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book one of the Restoration series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;87,000 words" />
