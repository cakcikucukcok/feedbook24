  <title>Rose in Scotland - Joan Overfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A delicate flower &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Caroline Burroughs is desperate. Her unscrupulous guardian is squandering away her inheritance, and now wants to gain complete control over her dwindling wealth by forcing her to wed his aged crony. But Caroline has found a solution to her woes. Though it means surrendering her long-cherished dream of marring for love, she agrees to a preemptive temporary union with a devilishly handsome stranger&amp;#8212;a brave and noble Scotsman who believes that love is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thorny romance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Hugh MacColme has every reason to hate the British&amp;#8212;since the Crown stole his ancestral castle and sent his father and brother into exile. And he never imagined he would end up marrying one of the enemy. But a year spent in the intimate company of an exquisite English rose seems a small price to pay for recovering his birthright. For tender-hearted Caroline, however, the difficult part will be coping with her unexpected desire for this proud and distant man&amp;#8212;no use for is the warm and healing love he truly needs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
