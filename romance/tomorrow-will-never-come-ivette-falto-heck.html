  <title>Tomorrow Will Never Come - Ivette Falto-Heck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It has been over a year since Nicole had parted from her strikingly handsome boyfriend Brent McWilliams, or whom she referred to as the love of her life. Yet, she still used the excuse of not being over Brent to refuse the advances of Hasayn Mosed, a charming and attractive Middle-Easterner who she had met at work. It was love at the first sight for Hasayn, while Nicole struggled with childhood-learned prejudice from the start. But Hasayns persistence was no match for Nicoles resistance. Her heart finally succumbed to Hasayns insistence pursuit. Her acceptance of Hasayn was reinforced after meeting his parents. The Moseds welcomed her with open arms &lt;br&gt; 
Just a few months after the most romantic courtship, Nicoles love for Hasayn turned into distrust and fear as she suspected something terrifyingly wrong about the Moseds. With not many to confide on, Nicole hesitantly turned into her former boyfriend Brent, a naval officer and expert on nuclear weapons, to help her find out the truth about the Moseds. Nicoles reunion with Brent was everything she had anticipated, and her desire to reunite with Brent further damaged her relationship with Hasayn.&lt;br&gt; 
Nicoles suspicions of the Moseds turned out to be much worse than what she had speculated. Instead of running away from them, Brent and his FBI friends convinced her to help set a trap for the Moseds. Nicole found herself entrapped in a mouse and cat game more dangerous than what she was willing to bargain for: wrestling between the love and loyalty once she felt for the Moseds and her sense of duty.&lt;br&gt; 
Fighting for her live became the norm of the day for Nicole: barely escaping from one tragedy to find herself trapped in another. Yet, her unfortunate fate was inconsequential compared to what was coming: the clock was ticking fast for America and not even Nicole could stop it!&lt;br&gt;" />
