  <title>The Boss and Her Billionaire: A Love on Deck Book - Michele de Winton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Boss and Her Billionaire: A Love on Deck Book by Michele De Winton&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cruise director Michaela Western has everything she wants--everything except a sex life. But there are no secrets on cruise ships. She risked her job once for a dalliance with the Captain, and won&#39;t do it again for a few minutes of toe-curling pleasure. Until a devilishly handsome new staffer with a body made for sin tempts her to walk on the wild side... Investment billionaire Dylan Johns always gets what he wants. He is used to giving orders--not taking them--until he&#39;s forced to go on hiatus from his investment company. To bide his time and carry out an old dream, he takes a job on a cruise ship--and ends up taking orders from his gorgeous, but uptight, new boss. He is determined to loosen her up with a fun onboard romance, but their no-strings fling turns serious and Dylan is forced to confess his lies. When the affair threatens to shatter Michaela&#39;s own career dreams, she finds herself caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.&lt;/p&gt;" />
