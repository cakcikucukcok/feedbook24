  <title>Pregnant By The Colton Cowboy (Mills &amp; Boon Romantic Suspense) (The Coltons of Shadow Creek, Book 3) - Lara Lacombe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;A cowboy puts his life on the line for the woman expecting his child!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Determined to steer clear of the horrors of his family, rancher Thorne Colton keeps to himself – which means resisting Maggie Lowell. Last time they were together, he succumbed and passion took control. But when an explosion nearly claims her life, Thorne discovers their night together yielded more than just sizzling memories.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pregnant and under Thorne&#39;s protection, Maggie isn&#39;t sure where the bigger threat lies. Out in the open, she&#39;s a killer&#39;s target. On his ranch, she&#39;s in close quarters with the man who&#39;s driven to keep her and their child safe, but broke her heart once and might do it again…&lt;/p&gt;
