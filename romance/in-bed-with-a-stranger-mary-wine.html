  <title>In Bed With A Stranger - Mary Wine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;An Imperfect Match&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brodick McJames is an earl in name only. To secure his clan&#39;s future he needs an English wife. Mary Stanford, daughter of the Earl of Warwickshire, will suit perfectly. He&#39;s never met her, but what matter? She&#39;ll grace his bed eventually, and once she bears his child he need see her no more.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne Copper looks just like her noble half-sister, but she was born illegitimate, and can never forget it. The best she can hope for is to stay a serving girl in her own father&#39;s house. But when Lady Mary finds herself betrothed to a Scot, it seems there&#39;s a use for Anne after all .  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The woman who arrives in Alcaon is not what Brodick expects, and the passion that grows between them promises far more than a marriage of convenience. When fate draws two together, it may take more than a noblewoman&#39;s plot to part them .  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;My kind of historical!.  .  .sweeps you into the time period without taking a thing away from delightful characters and a charming romance.  .  .definitely a must-read.&quot;  --Heather Graham" />
