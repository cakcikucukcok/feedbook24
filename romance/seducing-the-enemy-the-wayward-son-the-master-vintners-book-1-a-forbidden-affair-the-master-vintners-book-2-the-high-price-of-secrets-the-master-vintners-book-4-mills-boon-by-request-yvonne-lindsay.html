  <title>Seducing The Enemy: The Wayward Son (The Master Vintners, Book 1) / A Forbidden Affair (The Master Vintners, Book 2) / The High Price of Secrets (The Master Vintners, Book 4) (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Yvonne Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Keep you friends close, but your enemies closer…&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The Wayward Son&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Judd Wilson can finally take revenge on those who wronged him! He will dismantle his estranged father’s business empire and steal the man’s ravishing mistress too. Certainly the sizzling attraction Judd feels for Anna Garrick will make his vengeance sweeter!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;A Forbidden Affair&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nate finds it almost too easy to seduce his enemy’s daughter. And after their white-hot weekend, he issues an ultimatum – Nicole Wilson will work for him or her family will learn of their affair. Yet even as she bows to her lover’s demands, she questions if she dare trust a man planning to destroy all she holds dear?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The High Price of Secrets&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finn Gallagher has always been protective of his foster parents so when Tamsyn Masters appears on his doorstep, looking for her mother, he lies. But, when he starts to fall for her, Finn has to ensure that she never finds out his secret. Finn has to decide: Tamsyn or the truth, because he can’t have both.&lt;/p&gt;
