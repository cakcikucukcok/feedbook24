  <title>Heart of a Bad Boy - Sugar Jamison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bad Boys of Destiny are back and this sexy charmer will stop at nothing to win the heart of the one woman who never let him down. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelly Walker was born to be good. Raised by her deeply religious, prison guard father, Shelly was taught that good girls follow the rules--and definitely don&#39;t sin. Just as her father announces he&#39;s arranging her marriage, Shelly&#39;s childhood friend-turned-TV host, Levi King, unexpectedly returns. With his sexy smile and bad boy charm he&#39;s the type of guy who has sin written all over him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;           Levi has been fond of Shelly since childhood, but when he returns to town, he sees that the delicate girl he knew has turned into a bombshell. Levi encourages Shelly to shake things up, but when Shelly tells him that she&#39;s considering obeying her father and starting a family, Levi realizes that being with Shelly means more to him than just a good time. Will Shelly follow the rules or will she take a chance on the bad boy?&lt;/p&gt;" />
