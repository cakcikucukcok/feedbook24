  <title>For Whom You Love - Jordyn Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After an overwhelmingly traumatic incident leaves Paige Caldwell, a young San Diego police officer, crippled with anxiety and distrust, she is determined to maintain control over her world and the people in it. Hidden behind the emotional fortress she has built for herself, Paige allows few people to trespass into her emotions. She no longer sees life in a profusion of hues and saturation, but simply in black and white. Right and wrong. Life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preston Wakefield is the lead singer of the rebounding musical group, Aldengate. At the height of their fame, ten years prior, Aldengates popularity was likened to that of the Beatles, inviting chaos and pandemonium wherever they went. When the group disbanded, each member embarked on their own projects, but eventually reunited a decade later. With their reunion tour selling out stadiums across the country, it was obvious that time had not diminished the fierce loyalty of their fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Paiges lifelong friend, and co-worker, Taylor Wellington, asks her to fill an empty spot providing security for an Aldengate concert, she reluctantly agrees. Despite her desire not to allow her anxiety rule her life, the clamor and commotion surrounding the venue leaves her staggering to regain her composure. Finding respite in a small alcove, Paige meets Preston in a chance encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against Taylors cynical assessment of Preston, Paige embarks on a secret courtship with Preston while remaining resolute to avoid the chaos that seems to follow him. As the romance evolves, Preston becomes increasingly irritated with Taylors meddling, threatening to unravel the very fabric of their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Paige refuses to let go of her best friend in order to save her relationship, Preston must decide if its because of a surreptitious love between them...or something more.
Despite her insistence that life is what you make of it, Paige will soon learn that life is not about why you livebut for whom you live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
