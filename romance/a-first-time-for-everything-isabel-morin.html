  <title>A First Time for Everything - Isabel Morin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hannah Bloom arrives on campus for her senior year of college a new woman. No more mortifying acne--though she still bears the scars--and no more trying to be invisible. She has two goals: get into med school and have sex before graduation. But getting into med school may prove easier than having sex, because Hannah has a secret--she&#39;s never even been kissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she needs is a tutor who&#39;ll give her lessons in all the things she&#39;s missed out on, and Casey Grant is the perfect candidate. Her dorm&#39;s resident player, he&#39;s not only the hottest guy she&#39;s ever seen, he already knows her secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only trouble is, nothing goes according to plan. Their lessons don&#39;t feel like lessons, they feel like the real thing. She tries to date other guys, but nothing can compare with what she has with Casey. If she&#39;s not careful she&#39;ll fall for him just like every other girl on campus--and have her heart broken like them, too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
