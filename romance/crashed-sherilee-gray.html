  <title>Crashed - Sherilee Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alexandra Franco lost her virginity and her heart to her best friend&#39;s older brother. When he walked away without looking back, it was a lesson well learned. Indulging in another hot night with him would just compound the mistakes she made all those years ago. Besides, Deacon&#39;s not the same boy she fell for, and she sure as hell doesn&#39;t want anything to do with the wealthy, ruthless man he&#39;s become. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deacon West knows that turning his back on Alex was a huge mistake, but he&#39;s older and wiser now, and he has a plan to get her back in his life and hopefully keep her there. He offers to sign over the building she and his sisters use for their auto repair business if she&#39;ll grant him a three-month, no-strings affair. He has a lot of making up to do before Alex will entrust her heart to him again. Good thing he never backs down from a challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Axle Alley Vipers series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Crashed&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Revved&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Wrecked&lt;/p&gt;" />
