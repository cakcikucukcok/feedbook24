  <title>One Summer At The Ranch: The Wyoming Cowboy / A Family for the Rugged Rancher / The Man Who Had Everything (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Rebecca Winters, Donna Alward, Christine Rimmer</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Wyoming Cowboy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-Marine Carson Lundgren&#39;s Wyoming ranch is a place where families of fallen war heroes can find joy and healing. The wounded vet is eager to give back, while rebuilding his own life. The last thing he expected is to fall for his first guest and her young son.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Widow Tracy Baretta and six-year-old Johnny have been struggling since losing their husband and father. When they meet Carson, his strength, patience and generosity – along with how great he looks on a horse – leads little Johnny to call him “king of the cowboys”. They’ve fallen in love with the place…and maybe with the man himself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But is she just looking for a surrogate father? Or could this incredible cowboy really be the one who’ll make her and her son believe in love again?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Family for the Rugged Rancher&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instant family…just add one father!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gruff rancher Luke Evans’s new live-in housekeeper comes with an unexpected addition…a small son. Emily may be pretty—and even Luke has to grudgingly admit little Sam’s quite cute—but a family is not on this die-hard bachelor’s wish list. Luke’s plan? To spend as much time away from the house as possible. But, slowly charmed by Emily’s sunny smile and Sam’s infectious giggle, Luke begins to wonder if there might be room on his ranch, and in his heart, for a family after all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Man Who Had Everything&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Grant Clifton is one of the most eligible bachelors in Thunder Canyon. This&lt;br /&gt;rancher turned business whiz makes women melt like Montana snow on a&lt;br /&gt;hot summer day! And Grant’s many charms definitely aren’t lost on Stephanie&lt;br /&gt;Julen—the beautiful young foreman of Grant’s family ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Grant and Steph have known each other forever, and the senseless tragedy&lt;br /&gt;that shattered both their lives years ago gave them a lasting bond. But the&lt;br /&gt;Canyon’s golden boy has always thought of shy Steph as a little sister.&lt;br /&gt;So what will happen when he realizes she’s all grown up!&lt;/p&gt;
