  <title>Internet Dating - J. R. Niles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If someone were to ask Lance Austin to put into words, his feelings and his beliefs about love, he would be hard pressed to provide a short definitive answer. Ask him to show a particular woman that he loves herand you would be wasting your time. He will have already strapped himself into his 100 M.P.H., high flying roller coaster and taken off into his over-the-top expressions of true endearment for whomever he has chosen as his mate.
When Lance takes his love journey onto the internet for the first time in his life, he does find love; but will it last? Will the life changing experience that Melanie Powell brings to the table, be for the better in their lives or for the worst? The sexual experiences they share are extraordinary and often. The poems and love letters he writes to her are excessive. They often exchange extravagant gifts and they experience many new venues together; and oh, lets not forget the arguing and the fighting that comes gift wrapped with all of the above. Will this potentially lethal combination prove to be their downfall in an attempt at everlasting love?
In between all of that, Lance manages to meet other cyber space hopefuls online; though his heart is still with Melanie. There are a variety of reasons why he shouldnt be with any of these women but he allows himself to entertain the thought of it anyway. He meets some of them in person at least once, finding himself strapped into another kind of roller coaster; one that is mentally challenging, humorous, painfully dramatic, yet ultimately disappointing. Lance begins to reflect upon his own internal qualities and only time will tell in which direction his emotions will take him from a moral stand point.
When Lance turns to his family and friends for a certain sense of solitude, most of them bring their own emotional problems to light, in ways that surprise even Lance. One platonic friendship he hopes to find some level of comfort in, that of Sherry Anderson starts to go into its own version of a mental tail-spin for him. He is curious to say the least, about Sherrys overall intentions and if theres more to their friendship than meets the eye.
To measure the emotional value of this depiction of nearly five years of Lance Austins life is impossible to do. This journey for him is about life itself with the technological trend of the internet dating craze as the main back drop. Where will Lance wind up morally, mentally, spiritually, after meeting over a dozen of these cyber space women? Find out when you read Internet Dating!!" />
