Because after a lifetime of demons, Jamie has finally found an angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ellie Pearce learned the hard way that boys can&#39;t be trusted. But the night she meets Jamie, something shifts. He&#39;s different: brooding, a bit dark, determined to change. The connection they share is intense, compelling.

When fate goes horribly wrong, Jamie&#39;s only hope of saving his family is to strike a deal with the devil. Most of all, Jamie wants to prove he&#39;s the person Ellie believes him to be.
