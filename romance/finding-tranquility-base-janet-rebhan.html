  <title>Finding Tranquility Base - Janet Rebhan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a young girl&amp;#39;s family in west Texas is torn apart by tragedy, she takes a volunteer position at the local VA hospital to escape the suffering that has enveloped her home. As a shocking truth threatens to tear the town apart, she falls for a convalescing GI and together they discover the healing power of love. A suspenseful and touching metaphor for the turmoil of the Vietnam War, Janet Rebhan&amp;#39;s debut captures the flavor of small town Texas life with the visceral understanding of Larry McMurtry&amp;#39;s Last Picture Show and the soul of Billie Letts&amp;#39; Where the Heart Is. Sixteen year-old Riley Pritchard&amp;#39;s family is altered forever when a tornado destroys her home and triggers a series of dramatic events. When the ultimate tragedy punctuates their decimated lives, each family member, from her beautiful, self-centered mother and hardworking, sentimental father to her kick-ass, air-headed older brother, grieves alone, isolated in a suffocating sadness. In a desperate attempt to extricate herself from the pain and sorrow of a home where the walls seem to be closing in tighter every day, Riley volunteers at the local Veterans Administration hospital. There she meets Johnny, a young soldier and survivor of a helicopter crash in Vietnam who has returned home with severe burns covering the lower half of his body. Together they begin to discover the redemptive and healing power of love. A moving coming of age story about finding inner peace and fulfillment in the face of heartbreak and loss, Rebhan delivers a nuanced, captivating portrayal of blossoming adulthood. Showing remarkable felicity for time and place, she imbues her novel with the numbing desolation of west Texas as she explores the themes of self-reliance, self-preservation, and strength amidst adversity. As engaging as it is entertaining, Finding Tranquility Base is a thought-provoking, inspiring story that will change the way you view the world all over again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
