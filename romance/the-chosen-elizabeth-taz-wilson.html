  <title>The Chosen - Elizabeth ‘Taz’ Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Niyaniis heart beat painfully against her chest as the fifth man came towards her. His piercing blue eyes were icy as they stabbed trough her. She had never looked at a man like this before and she had to admit, he was something to look at. Cyrus started with her legs. They were long, well toned and so smooth. He watched her shiver and then goose bumps cover her body. Cyrus could tell she was strong and in complete health. He picked up her right hand. This girl was not meant for field work; perhaps a maid? But yet her hands were so smooth. Not rough. So, whats your bid? He suddenly cupped one of her breasts. Niyanii smacked him. Everyone went quiet except for someone who was laughing at the back of the room. How dare he touch her like that! Cyrus looked down at her shocked. Those baby blue eyes were so damn beautiful and furious. She watched the guy pull a red money bag from inside his tunic and hand it to Raevin. Did the guy just buy her? Niyanii would have been outraged, if he didnt walk over to her and pull off his tunic. Then he wrapped the warmed cloth around her.
            Help me? She whispered. He looked surprised, but those icy eyes turned into liquid warmth.
