  <title>Her Best Man (Fast Fiction) - Brenda Harlen</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Fast Fiction Romantic - short stories with a Happy Ever After&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amy Jensen was determined her sister&#39;s wedding would be perfect. Which meant she couldn&#39;t let the best man, Ben Seabrook, get under her skin. After all, it had been more than a decade since they&#39;d gone their separate ways. He&#39;d become an award-winning journalist, and she&#39;d become an ER doctor. Surely there would be no feelings left between them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And yet, as soon as she saw Ben at the rehearsal, Amy knew she was in trouble. All the old feelings were still there, plus a few new sparks. And Ben seemed determined to make her remember how good they had been together—and still were. But Ben was only in town for the wedding, and Amy had her own plans for the future. If she gave in to the chemistry between them, would she only be setting herself up for more pain?&lt;/p&gt;
