      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the gritty biker world of the Raising Hellfire MC series where these L.A. bikers drink hard, drive fast, and dig deep for love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;De Winton brings the sass and the smexy as Cole and Briony burn up the sheets in this must read biker romance.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Amy Andrews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Burning to Ride&lt;/i&gt;, this sexy 2-in-1 set from &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Michele De Winton, features &lt;i&gt;Burned by Lust &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Burned by Blackmail&lt;/i&gt; - previously released as individual titles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Burned by Lust&lt;/i&gt;, Biker, Hard Corban, is set to take over the Raising Hellfire MC and doesn&#39;t have love on his agenda. But Lee Delevinge, a raven-haired burlesque dancer running from her past, is set on burning up his heart. When their fling takes a serious turn, could they have the relationship they both crave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Burned by Blackmail&lt;/i&gt;, Briony Wilde is desperate to save her biker bar from a millionaire developer.
