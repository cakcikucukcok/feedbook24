        &lt;p&gt;Everything came easily to Dr. Beau Dalton–until she walked in. Medical assistant Shelby Wheeling had secrets–big secrets. But that didn&#39;t ease the attraction that sizzled between them. Still, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; was she refusing to open up to him? And why was she so intrigued by old medical records?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shelby couldn&#39;t put her past away until she accomplished one mission: find her birth parents. And no matter how much the sexy doctor made her heart race, she couldn&#39;t risk being sidetracked. But Beau&#39;s wicked loving ways seduced her from her determination to stay alone….&lt;/p&gt;
