  <title>Cover Fire - Jess Anastasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If the assignment is crazy, dangerous, or a little of both, Sub-Lieutenant Sebastian Rayne can&#39;t help but take on the challenge. So when Command Intelligence tags him to fly one of their agents behind enemy lines, it seems like just another routine death-defying mission. Crash landing on the planet was a piece of cake, but the gorgeous agent he delivered safely to her meeting is now believed dead and he must return to retrieve her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Agent Jenna Maxwell realizes her own people attempted to have her killed, she enlists the hot stick jockey&#39;s help. His new mission? Sneak her back onto his ship to ferret out who wanted to get rid of her and why. But she fears her growing feelings for Seb have blinded her to his reckless insistence on helping her stay alive, and his rash behavior will cause them both to lose their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Valiant Knox series is a standalone and can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Escape Velocity&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Damage Control&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Cover Fire&lt;br&gt;Book #4 War Games&lt;/p&gt;" />
