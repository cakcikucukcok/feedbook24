            &lt;strong&gt;Starting again together?&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a dark family history, single dad Leon Malatesta is determined to keep his baby daughter safe. And so when striking Belle Peterson starts asking questions, Leon’s protective instinct goes into overdrive – and so does his attraction to Belle.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luke Storm ended his relationship with Abby Tyler because he didn’t want a family. Now, five years later, when he meets Abby again, with a little boy of her own, Luke is rocked. If he wants Abby back in his life again, he must let her special little son into his heart…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tess Laing has suffered more heartbreak than most. So moving to Bellaroo Creek with her little orphaned niece and nephew is the start of a new life. Meeting tall, dark and deliciously handsome Cameron Manning starts an unexpected flutter in her heart…&lt;/p&gt;
