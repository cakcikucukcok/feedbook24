      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melody Tarleton is driving home for Christmas when a man&amp;#151;clad in Revolutionary War–era costume&amp;#151;appears out of nowhere, right in the path of her car. Shaken, she takes the injured stranger in, listening with concern to Jake Mallory&#39;s fantastic claim that he&#39;s a Patriot soldier executed by British authorities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bringing Jake to her parents&#39; house, Melody concocts a story to explain the handsome holiday guest with the courtly manners and strange clothes. Mark, her close friend who wishes he were more, is skeptical, but her family is fascinated. So is Melody. Jake is passionate, charming and utterly unlike anyone she&#39;s ever met. Can he really be who he claims? And can a man from the distant past be the future she truly longs for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
