        &lt;p&gt;Eight Bundles of Joy Collection&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Outback Baby Miracle by Melissa James&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As untamed as the Outback land he masters, cattleman Jake Connors is a mystery to Laila. Something hidden inside him calls to the woman in her, in a way no other man ever has.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is Laila&#39;s pregnancy surprise the miracle they both need?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marriage for Baby by Melissa McClone&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A tiny bundle that needs them…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jared and Kate are separated when they find themselves guardians of an orphaned baby. The one hitch is, for them both to be guardians, they have to stay married! A marriage of convenience seems the only option…. To be parents of convenience!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Duke’s Baby by Rebecca Winters&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The French duke&#39;s contract bride!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lance Malbois, Duc du Lac: a hardened military man with a scar that crosses his cheek–and reaches right to his heart. But all he wants is to hold a child in his arms and be called &#39;Daddy.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Andrea Fallon: pregnant, widowed and alone, she&#39;s determined to give her baby the father and family she never had. The perfect solution: a marriage of convenience…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Rancher’s Doorstep Baby by Patricia Thayer&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cole Parrish arrived at the Bar H ranch to work. That was all. Not to settle down, and certainly not to be tempted by the stunning redhead running the ranch all by herself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now a little baby has arrived on the doorstep–and Rachel has gone from auntie to mother overnight. She needs all the help she can get…but Cole can&#39;t stay. He never promised anything.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her Baby, His Proposal by Teresa Carpenter&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From military man to full time father!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brock Sullivan is a navy SEAL–he lives by his own code of honor and he won&#39;t see Jesse, pregnant and alone, struggle. He doesn&#39;t have to help her, but he knows he can offer her security while he&#39;s away fighting for his country. The proposal is convenient and the marriage–paper only!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But, injured in battle, Brock is suddenly home, and what was a simple marriage of convenience is now becoming a whole lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Baby Bind by Nikki Benjamin&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A second chance?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Charlotte Fagan’s attempts to get pregnant had strained her marriage to breaking point. Then the call came – the Fagans were approved for adoption. Her husband, Sean, agreed to pose as the happily married father-to-be – provided that once the adoption went through Charlotte granted him a divorce. Now at least one of her dreams would come true…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Would a beautiful baby girl tear Charlotte and Sean apart – or bind them together like never before?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Daddy on Call by Judy Duarte&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luke Wynter had worked hard to become a doctor, to give back to the community he&#39;d taken from years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Leilani Stephens came back into his life. Twelve years ago she had made it clear that she no longer considered him a friend, let alone a lover. And he&#39;d never been one to plead or beg.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now he felt drawn to her all over again–yet felt that something was unsettled, unfinished. Unsaid. What had Leilani been hiding from him all these years?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Midwife’s Little Miracle by Fiona McArthur&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tiny baby: father needed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finding she was pregnant was the best moment of midwife Montana’s life. But days later she was widowed. Now nine months have passed, she has a tiny infant, and she knows it’s time to make a fresh start. Dr Andy Buchanan has offered Montana a job at Lyrebird Lake because it’s the perfect place to build a new life. Her courage impresses him. And he just can’t get the beautiful new mum out of his mind…&lt;/p&gt;
