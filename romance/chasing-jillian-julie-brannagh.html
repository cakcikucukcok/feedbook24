      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Score a touchdown with Julie Brannagh&amp;#39;s latest Love and Football novel&amp;#8212;about discovering who you are and finding love along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jillian Miller likes her job working in the front office for the Seattle Sharks, but lately being surrounded by a constant parade of perfection only seems to make her own imperfections all the more obvious. She needs a change, which takes her into foreign territory: the Sharks&amp;#39; workout facility after hours. The last thing she expects is a hot, grumbly god among men to be there as witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star linebacker Seth Taylor has had a bad day&amp;#8212;well, a series of them recently. When he hits the Sharks&amp;#39; gym to work out his frustration, he&amp;#39;s startled to find someone there&amp;#8212;and even more surprised that it&amp;#39;s Jillian, the team owner&amp;#39;s administrative assistant. When he learns of her mission to revamp her lifestyle, he finds himself volunteering to help. Something about Jillian&amp;#39;s beautiful smile and quick wit makes him want to stick around. She may not be like the swimsuit models he usually has on his arm, but the more time Seth spends with her, the harder he falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Jillian discovers that the new her is about so much more than she sees in the mirror, can she discover that happiness and love are oh-so-much better than perfect?&lt;/p&gt;" />
