  <title>How to Belong with a Billionaire - Alexis Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&#39;t miss the epic conclusion to Caspian Hart and Arden St. Ives&#39; love story! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you love someone, set them free...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I thought I&#39;d be okay when Caspian Hart left. He was a brilliant, beautiful billionaire with a past he couldn&#39;t escape. And I was ... just me: an ordinary man lost in his own life. It would never have lasted. It should never have happened.  Not outside a fairytale.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And I am okay. I&#39;ve got my job, my family, my friends, and everything Caspian taught me. Except it turns out he&#39;s going to marry his ex-boyfriend. A man who doesn&#39;t understand him. A man who almost broke him. And I&#39;ve finally realized it&#39;s not enough for me to be happy. I need Caspian to be happy too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Problem is, I&#39;ve already done all I can to help him. I&#39;ve followed his rules and broken his rules and learned his secrets. And he still won&#39;t believe I can love him. So now it&#39;s his turn. His turn to fight, and trust, and hope. It&#39;s time for Caspian Hart to choose me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Arden St. Ives Series: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Bang a Billionaire &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Blow it with a Billionaire &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Belong with a Billionaire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
