  <title>One More Miracle - Carol M Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Readers have said of One More Miracle - - -
Intriguing. More than just a love story.
Very engaging plot and characters.
Couldnt put it down.
Anna always had faith in miracles, but that was before her husbands disappearance and her daughters horrific accident. Not that her life had been perfect before that, far from it. But she always knew she was resilient enough to go on.
This time, though, she was all alone when she watched her life crash and burn, and Anna wondered if she could rise from the ashes. Then the handsome Steve came into her life offering the strong and loving friendship she needed. She was glad to accept what he offered, but would his friendship be enough for Anna?" />
