  <title>A SEAL&#39;s Honor - JM Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rules are made to be broken . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When it comes to dating, ex-Navy SEAL Marcus Denali has a few simple rules. Never date a coworker. Never date a friend&#39;s sister. And never ever date a girl whose brother is a coworker, a friend, and a fellow SEAL. So why would Marcus dance so closely -- and flirt so shamelessly -- with Mandy Lawson? Simple. It&#39;s a Fourth of July masquerade ball. He doesn&#39;t know she&#39;s his buddy&#39;s little sister. And once the masks come off, the real fireworks begin . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Mandy doesn&#39;t care about the rules. She&#39;s been crushing on Marcus for years, and she&#39;s not giving up now that she has proof he wants her too. She has a plan to show this military man some moves he never learned in basic training. And Marcus is going to learn that some rules-the rules of attraction -- are just too strong to fight." />
