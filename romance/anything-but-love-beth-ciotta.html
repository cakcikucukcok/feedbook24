  <title>Anything But Love - Beth Ciotta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Reagan Deveraux, Sugar Creek, Vermont, and the Cupcake Lovers are a dream come true: A cozy little town where family and friends come before everything else. She&#39;s never experienced anything like it--especially not growing up with her mother, a fickle, fame-hungry heiress. But Rae&#39;s plan to hide out in anonymity for a year until she can claim her inheritance--and her independence--changes with one kiss from gorgeous pub owner Luke Monroe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke&#39;s charm is legendary, but he&#39;s never been a one-woman man. Until Rae captures his attention, that is, and then disappears. With a little help from a friend, Luke tracks her down--and unearths secrets almost too wild to be true, as well as the fact that Rae lied to him, and to all of Sugar Creek. Luke&#39;s not sure if he can forgive her, but he definitely can&#39;t forget her, and when she returns to save the Cupcake Lovers from disaster, he knows it&#39;s his chance to get the truth--and get the girl, this time for good... &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anything But Love&lt;/i&gt; is the third Cupcake Lovers novel from Beth Ciotta.&lt;/p&gt;" />
