  <title>Dreams of the Soul - Miran Horvat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What could be better than opening a beautiful book on a long, cold, winter evening and allowing oneself to be comfortably transported on the wings of imagination across different areas of the world and to experience its beauties and its dark sides or, for instance, take a walk through a winter forest, heavily laden with soft snow, which is joyously sparkling under the sunrays that are playfully penetrating the spruce tree branches, and follow a walker  explorer and his friend, Bricky, the dog. The two of them are exploring the near and far surroundings of their home, situated in the high, mountain world. The explorer&#39;s grandpa lives in that home; in his younger years he was a diplomat, who was sent on important missions throughout the world in order to help solve difficult global problems. Even now, in his old age, he is trying to help the suffering humanity. He is therefore endowed with rich life experience and broad knowledge, which greatly attracts the young explorer. Thus an interesting conversation develops between them, which takes place during the carefree time of winter holidays." />
