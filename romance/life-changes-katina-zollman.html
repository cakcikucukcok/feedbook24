Forced to wait tables to cover a shift for a no-show employee one evening, Katie is focused on taking care of her tablesuntil she notices a handsome male customer. Unnervingly, Rich seems to know what she is thinking even before she opens her mouth.

&lt;P&gt;Now in critical condition and fighting for her life, Katie must rely on Rich to be her advocate. But as Katie slowly begins to rejoin the world she left behind, she must face the reality that she has no idea who Rich is or what her future holds. But as long-held secrets bubble to the surface, Rich unveils his vampire abilities and Katie divulges her gifts as a shape shifter, setting off a chain of events that change everything.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this romantic fantasy, a young woman whose life is forever altered by a car accident must learn to follow her heart after her path changes direction.&lt;/P&gt;" />
