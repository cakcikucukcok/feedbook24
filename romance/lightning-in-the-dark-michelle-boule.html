  <title>Lightning in the Dark - Michelle Boule</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Iris is a simple postmistress in the small town of Turning Creek, Colorado. Simple, except for being a descendant of a Greek myth, having a pair of golden wings, and possessing the ability to speak prophecy. She has had her hands so full guiding the harpies towards their destinies that she has forgotten to seek out her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mysterious letter from an anonymous admirer begins a correspondence that weaves itself into Iris&amp;rsquo;s heart and awakens a longing for a love of her own. The letters keep arriving, and Iris is increasingly more aware of the charms of Jacob Wells, a newcomer to Turning Creek. She wonders if the letters are from him. But even with Jacob&amp;rsquo;s charisma and the lure of a new relationship, Iris discovers the heart can&amp;#39;t be contained, and that her heart&amp;rsquo;s desire might be for someone who was there all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Iris, the letters and the resulting affairs of the heart are not the only perplexing things happening in Turning Creek. Something more than nature is burying the town in a deadly winter blanket, and a closely guarded secret that will change Turning Creek forever is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
