  <title>Hearts of the Anemoi Bundle - Laura Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;North of Need&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called to life by Megan Snow&#39;s tears, snow god Owen Winters appears unconscious on the widow&#39;s doorstep in the midst of a raging blizzard. Owen finds unexpected solace in her company and unimagined pleasure in the warmth of her body, and vows to win her heart for a chance at humanity. Megan is drawn to Owen, but this Christmas miracle comes with an expiration--before the snow melts and the temperature rises, Megan must let go of her widow&#39;s grief and learn to trust love again, or she&#39;ll lose Owen forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;West of Want&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Marcella Raines&#39; twin brother dies, she honors his request to be buried at sea, never expecting the violent storm that swamps her boat. Zephyros Martius is the Supreme God of the West Wind and Spring. Ella is drawn to the vulnerability Zeph hides beneath his otherworldly masculinity. She and Zeph struggle to let go of the past, defend their future, and embrace a love that can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;South of Surrender&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laney Summerlyn needs the organized routine of her life at Summerlyn Stables. But everything changes when a ferocious storm brings an impossible--and beautiful--creature crashing down from the heavens. Injured while fighting Eurus, Chrysander Notos, Supreme God of the South Wind and Summer, finds himself at the mercy of a mortal woman whose compassion and acceptance he can&#39;t resist. As they surrender to the passion flaring between them, immortal enemies close in, forcing Chrys to choose between his brother and the only woman who&#39;s ever loved the real him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
