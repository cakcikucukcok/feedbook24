  <title>Brother’s Lust - Douglas Mayweather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
What happens when brotherly love turns into brotherly lust? Why would a brother’s affection for his brother become carnal desire? When one brother’s admiration for his brother grows into a longing to make love to him, how should that brother respond? Should he simply offer up his body to satisfy his brother’s debauched hunger, or become his brother’s lover? Read these stories and discover how fourteen brothers answered these questions.
EXCERPT
The other day Mom had decided to make lasagna from scratch, and dinner was a little late. By the time the dishes were done it was ten o’clock and she had retired to her room for the night. Instead of going home I had settled down to watch a documentary on PBS. It wasn’t as interesting as I had hoped and so I was doing a crossword puzzle at the same time.
Corbin was outside doing something to his pickup. I heard him come in and go to the bathroom. I thought I might ask him if he wanted to go have a beer. After a while I decided he must be taking a shower. Without realizing it I dozed off – one of those times when you’re half asleep and half awake. I let the pencil slip from my hand.
“Anson!” I became aware I was hearing my name, not dreaming. 
“Anson, are you asleep?”
I opened my eyes to see Corbin standing just inside the doorway. He was naked from head to toe. My first thought was not what you would think. He’d always had a nice body, but had stopped working out after his last divorce. My thought was he needed to start again – he was getting a little pudgy around the middle.
As my senses returned I saw he was holding his cock in his hand – and it was probably about half hard. I’d never seen it before and I was amazed at how big it was – certainly bigger than mine.
He looked down at it and back up to meet my gaze. “I was wondering if you…uh…would….uh…you know.”
I reached my hand out and said, “Come here.”
