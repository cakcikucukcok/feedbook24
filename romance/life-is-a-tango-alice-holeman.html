&lt;p&gt;A seasoned widow, Jo McCrae is disillusioned with life, love, and even Christianity. In desperation, she joins an ecumenical South American tour group, hoping to regain her zest for life and inspire her broken spirit. Enjoy her reactions to the near-nudity on the beaches of Rio, the Argentine tango and the passionate romance that blooms in Buenos Aires, a too-close encounter with the magnificent Machu Picchu in Peru, and much more. All this is shared with her new and soon to be intimate friends, a Hindu, a Hassidic Jew, and a Muslim woman. From them she learns that, at their core, these major religions seem to nurture many of the same truths and hold more similarities than differences. Through it all, Jo begins to pick up the lost pieces of herself and manages to add precious, new depth and facets to the persona that is Jo McCrae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a Tango is a romantic novel for readers looking for intellectual stimulation along with an exhilarating, sexy, and action-packed read.&lt;/p&gt;
