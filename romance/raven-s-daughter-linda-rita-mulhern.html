  <title>Raven’S Daughter - Linda Rita Mulhern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little Nuska is determined not to cry after she is snatched from her tribe and thrown into a canoe. Nuska cannot begin to imagine what lies ahead for her as her captors push the canoe onto a beach near a strange tribal village. After the tribes chief adopts her as his daughter, Nuska learns to surviveuntil a young chief claims her as the woman in his vision and takes her as his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuska, who is in love for the first time, thrives until she hears the dark prophecy of her husbands vision. After he sends her away and prepares to defend his village, a pregnant Nuska embarks on a journey to find her family where she receives life-changing news and help from an Inuit friend. But when her path leads her to an American rancher who offers to help and soon falls in love with her, their journey takes them in a different direction after word of a massacre up the river reaches them. As she receives shocking news, Nuska mistakenly decides to take matters into her own hands, leaving just one person to save her from herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ravens Daughter&lt;/i&gt; weaves the historical tale of a young womans coming-of-age journey as she fights to return to her former life and discovers that fate, not she, controls her future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
