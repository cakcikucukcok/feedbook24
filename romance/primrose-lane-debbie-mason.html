  <title>Primrose Lane - Debbie Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love is the best medicine&lt;br&gt;  Olivia Davenport has finally gotten her life back together. She&#39;s left her painful past behind, started over in a new town, and become Harmony Harbor&#39;s most sought-after event planner. But her past catches up to her when Olivia learns that she&#39;s now guardian of her ex&#39;s young daughter. With her world spinning, Olivia must reconcile her old life with her new one. And she doesn&#39;t have time for her new next door neighbor, no matter how handsome he is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Olivia may act like she&#39;s got everything under control, but Dr. Finn Gallagher knows a person in over her head when he sees one. He&#39;d really like to be the shoulder she leans on, but Olivia makes it clear she doesn&#39;t want his help. Since he&#39;s returned to town, his waiting room has been full of single women feigning illness. Yet the one woman he&#39;s interested in is avoiding him. But with a little help from some matchmaking widows and a precocious little girl, Finn might just win Olivia over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  BONUS: Includes a complete novel from BookShots Flames! &lt;i&gt;The McCullagh Inn in Maine&lt;/i&gt; by Jen McLaughlin&lt;/div&gt;" />
