  <title>Snowed In - Jenna Bayley-Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;He&#39;s her ex-fiance&#39;s ex-best man. She&#39;s the one that got away. And now they&#39;re &lt;i&gt;Snowed In&lt;/i&gt; for the weekend.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marissa Clarke was going to murder someone. And that someone was her former sorority sister--now former friend--who had just kicked her out of her own hotel room...in the middle of the night...at their friend&#39;s wedding...for some hanky-panky with an old fling. So much for sisterhood. With no room in the inn and no place to stay, she&#39;s forced to accept help from the last person she ever wanted to spend the night with again: Scott, devilishly handsome, smart, and her ex-fiance&#39;s ex-best man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Parker has loved Marissa since the first day he bumped into her freshman year of college. Only he&#39;d never been able to tell her. After all, you didn&#39;t just grab your best friend&#39;s girlfriend, kiss her and tell her she was &lt;i&gt;the One&lt;/i&gt; for you, no matter how often he&#39;d dreamed about it. Now, years later, Marissa is single and, in a moment of pure luck, staying at his cabin. When a winter storm blocks the roads and snows the two of them in, Scott is determined to make Marissa see there can be more between them than a shared history...if only she&#39;ll let him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
