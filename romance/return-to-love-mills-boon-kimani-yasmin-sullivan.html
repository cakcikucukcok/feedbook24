  <title>Return to Love (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) - Yasmin Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A second chance for a first love?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, Nigel Johns lost the only woman he ever loved. Now, the successful financial consultant intends to prove to Regina Gibson that he’s a changed man. Except his ex-fiancée isn’t welcoming him with open arms. In fact, she’s doing everything she can to keep him out of her life and away from her painful secret. Until an unexpected night of rekindled passion gives him hope for a second chance…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After she walked away from Nigel, Regina lost the one thing she loved most. Since then, she&#39;s put all her energy into making it as an artist and forgetting the man who broke her heart. Now that Nigel is back and reawakening her body, she has to decide what she really wants.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She can’t deny that they still make sensual magic together. But now that she’s back in his arms, will she let him back into her heart – forever?&lt;/p&gt;
