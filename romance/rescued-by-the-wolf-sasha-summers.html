  <title>Rescued by the Wolf - Sasha Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mal wants one thing in life--vengeance against those that deserted him and those who tortured him. But rescuing a wounded woman from their captors, one that wreaks of innocence and fear, makes Mal put his plan on hold. Temporarily. He&#39;ll do what he needs to keep her alive and safe, even if it changes both of their lives forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being stabbed and held in a dark cell wasn&#39;t on Olivia&#39;s top ten list. Her savior isn&#39;t exactly hero material. Angry, scarred, and pissed at the world, he seems to resent being saddled with her. But the longer they&#39;re together, the more firmly a connection forms between them. A connection that binds her to him, his pack, and his world. But that connection may just lead to her death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books in the Blood Moon Brotherhood series:&lt;br&gt;Falling for the Billionaire Wolf and His Baby&lt;br&gt;Rescued by the Wolf&lt;br&gt;Protecting the Wolf&#39;s Mate&lt;/p&gt;" />
