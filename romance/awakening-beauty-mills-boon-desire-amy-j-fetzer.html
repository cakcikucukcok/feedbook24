  <title>Awakening Beauty (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Amy J. Fetzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;MONEY CAN&#39;T BUY EVERYTHING…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It certainly couldn&#39;t buy Lane Douglas a way out of the scandalous rumors that followed her everywhere, leaving her no choice but to take on a new identity in a new town. But she never imagined this endeavor to disguise her heiress status would awaken her dormant desire.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly she was embroiled in a wild tango of temperaments with high-powered playboy Tyler McKay, who was determined to have her in his bed. Lane was tempted beyond reason to take Tyler up on his offer and share the sheets in a blazing affair with this man who aroused her passion like no other. But would succumbing to Tyler&#39;s seduction bare their relationship to the tabloids and reveal her most closely guarded secret–or bring her everlasting pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;
