  <title>A Christmas Miracle for the Doctor - Victoria James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fall in love this holiday season with this heartwarming story about finding romance, the magic of Christmas, and the importance of family... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Children&#39;s bookstore owner Addie Mayberry believes in the magic of Christmas. Or at least, she used to. So when a young customer needs some seasonal optimism, Addie sets out to give the vulnerable, heartbroken little girl the best Christmas ever. Which means helping the hottest man in Shadow Creek, Bella&#39;s surgeon father, find his holiday spirit. Addie&#39;s up to the challenge, but between tree decorating and late night talks, she realizes she&#39;s starting to fall &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt; for the one man she definitely shouldn&#39;t. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew Barrett drastically changed his fast-paced life when he moved back to Shadow Creek, but it was all worth it to give his daughter a better life. He wasn&#39;t exactly winning dad-of-the-year awards before, so he&#39;s determined to make it up to Bella. And with Addie&#39;s help, he&#39;s slowly repairing his relationship with his daughter. The last thing he wants is to fall in love, since that road only leads to pain, but he can&#39;t stop thinking about Addie. Not only is she gorgeous, sweet, and great with Bella, she fills something in him he never knew was missing. But Addie wants forever, which is more than Drew can offer...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Shadow Creek, Montana series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Christmas with the Sheriff&lt;br&gt;* The Baby Bombshell&lt;br&gt;* The Doctor&#39;s Redemption&lt;br&gt;* Baby on the Bad Boy&#39;s Doorstep&lt;br&gt;* The Firefighter&#39;s Pretend Fiance&lt;br&gt;* A Christmas Miracle for the Doctor&lt;/p&gt;" />
