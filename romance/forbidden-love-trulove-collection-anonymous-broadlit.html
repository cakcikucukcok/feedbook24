  <title>Forbidden Love: TruLove Collection - Anonymous, BroadLit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;No one is immune to the temptation of forbidden love.&lt;BR&gt;Many of us merely dip our baby toe into this realm -- perhaps&lt;BR&gt;by Googling the names of old lovers to see what they look like&lt;BR&gt;now, years later, while our spouse watches television in another&lt;BR&gt;room. Or we spy on an alluring married co-worker by studying&lt;BR&gt;his Facebook page to learn as much as we can about him. Or we&lt;BR&gt;create detailed fantasies about someone who is definitely off-limits&lt;BR&gt;for one reason or another.&lt;BR&gt;However, the sexually adventurous characters in these tantalizing&lt;BR&gt;stories have plunged much deeper into the web of forbidden love,&lt;BR&gt;making the rest of us look like pikers. Why have sex with just your&lt;BR&gt;husband when you can also have it with his best friend &amp;#150; or even&lt;BR&gt;his mistress? You&amp;#8217;ll read about preachers who provide solace of&lt;BR&gt;the sexual kind and babysitters who look after more than just your&lt;BR&gt;children. Some of the sexual partners in these stories are illicit&lt;BR&gt;soul-mates &amp;#150; and some are selfish psychos. Who knew there was&lt;BR&gt;so much forbidden love to be had?&lt;BR&gt;But what pushes someone from merely thinking about forbidden&lt;BR&gt;love to actually engaging in it? Boredom or loneliness, of course.&lt;BR&gt;Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s motivated by a desire for revenge or by a streak&lt;BR&gt;of rebellion or a bout of feeling really low. Most often, though,&lt;BR&gt;a palpable carnal chemistry that ultimately proves irresistible&lt;BR&gt;can overwhelm even the most prudent among us with a&lt;BR&gt;breathtaking swiftness.&lt;BR&gt;This much is true about forbidden love: It is never boring.&lt;BR&gt;Unlike true love, it ultimately forces you to face the question: Is&lt;BR&gt;it worth it? And while forbidden love almost always comes with&lt;BR&gt;an expiration date, there are exquisitely rare occasions where it&lt;BR&gt;actually morphs into true love.&lt;BR&gt;The stories in this collection let us venture deeply into the&lt;BR&gt;libidinous world of forbidden love &amp;#150; all while never leaving the&lt;BR&gt;comfort of our own lives. Sit back and succumb to its pleasures.&lt;/div&gt;" />
