  <title>Truly Yours (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Boudreaux Family, Book 4) - Deborah Fletcher Mello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Legendary engineer Darryl Boudreaux is a master with his hands, and his creative genius is unparalleled. Many a woman has desired Darryl’s expert tutelage, but he is off the market—for anything serious.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Past experience has convinced him to focus his passion on his work. When architect Camryn Charles gets sight of her new partner, she is determined to keep things professional. This is easier said than done. Is it the heat of the smoldering French Quarter, or is it Darryl’s quiet sexiness that is raising her temperature? Camryn would never sacrifice her integrity for a few wanton moments between the sheets. Yet Darryl’s smoldering gaze suggests there could be something more between them—something that could dare them both to lay everything on the line….&lt;/p&gt;
