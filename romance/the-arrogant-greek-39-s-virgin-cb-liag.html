  <title>The Arrogant Greek&#39;s Virgin - Cb Liag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When two worlds collide, there is bound to be an explosion of cataclysmic proportions. So it was when a lovely and intelligent girl whose sheltered life and calm existence clashes with a world where the rich and powerful get what they want.
What began as a holiday to visit a friend turned into a life-changing experience when Savannah Redford came to the attention of the devastatingly handsome and powerful Greek billionaire Carlos Cassar.
Savannah is ill prepared for her body&#39;s reaction to the nearness of Carlos&#39; Greek-god, all-male physique. Her body screams out for Carlos&#39;s touch, but her mind tells her that he is too dangerous and arrogant for her to have a future with him.
Even the savvy and street-smart Millie, Savannah&#39;s best friend who knows of Carlos&#39;s playboy reputation, his money and influence, is powerless to keep them apart. Millies own past with a devastatingly handsome Greek man has her fearful for her friends well-being. 
For his part, Carlos is out of his depth with a woman who couldn&#39;t care less about his money or the influence his family name brings to his world. He is fully aware of her physical desire for him but very uncertain about how wise it would be to make love to her when she clearly doesn&#39;t like him very much.
It is not until Savannah offers herself to him in a moment of passion that she begins to have second thoughts and brings about a situation where Carlos has her on the verge of ultimate pleasure only to walk away, leaving her body unsatisfied, her mind on the brink of madness, and her heart shattered.
Humiliated and heartbroken she returns to her life in Australia, but after twelve months, Carlos still plagues her dreams.
When the universe aligns to bring the lovers together again, the result is even more devastatingone that will either make or break them." />
