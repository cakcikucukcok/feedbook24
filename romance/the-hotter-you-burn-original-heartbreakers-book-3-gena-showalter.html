  <title>The Hotter You Burn (Original Heartbreakers, Book 3) - Gena Showalter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;New York Times bestselling author Gena Showalter is back with another sizzling Original Heartbreakers story featuring an irresistible charmer about to meet his match… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beck Ockley lives by a single rule: one and done. The millionaire playboy knows the pain of loss and will do anything to avoid another. He moved to the small town of Strawberry Valley, Oklahoma, expecting more of the same–time with the only two friends he trusts, work…and lots of pleasure. What he never could have predicted was that a vulnerable Southern beauty would sneak past his defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Harlow Glass is determined to rebuild her life. The reformed bully has lost everyone and everything she loved, and she&#39;s paid the ultimate price for her checkered past. Now she wants commitment, the only thing Beck refuses to give. As their chemistry blazes white-hot, he&#39;ll either have to break her heart…or surrender his own.&lt;/p&gt;
