  <title>The True Spiritual Nature Of Love: Rediscovering The Magical Practice - Adam Joshua Lynch, Megan Lessig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the planet Eden, an angelic species known as the bispiritians thrive by the practices of romantic nature. The angelic species brings vitality to their planet by expressing fondness for their destined partners; they give to the planet by practicing love, and the planet gives back to them what is needed for their survival.            This was the intended way of life until corruption escalated to the surface, transforming everything that was once meant for beauty into an abomination. Competition, domination and control have become the world&#39;s new way of life. In order to survive in the times of war and chaos, lovers have turned against each other, attempting to rise over the other.            Gender separation has become the planet&#39;s norm, erasing even the memory of romantic intimacy. Sophia, who is filled with an unfathomable hatred for all males, has dedicated her life to eradicating every last one of them from the map permanently, but when she meets the pure-hearted Genesis, who stands against everything she&#39;s ever known about males, this complicates her resolve.           However, even as pure-hearted as Genesis may seem, he still has a share of his own flaws. Genesis and Sophia engage in several hostile encounters but each time they reach contact, an unknown energy sparks between them, and neither of them can comprehend what it is. Is it sexual attraction and manipulation? Is it confusing infatuation, or is it something much deeper?          As they travel deeper into the unknown, their hearts become widely exposed, unleashing retaliating defenses. Will Genesis and Sophia be the two to restore the magical memories of the planet&#39;s legendary practice, or will their pride of dominance separate them?          Journey into the unknown as Genesis and Sophia discover the beauty of the true spiritual nature of love." />
