  <title>The Cottages On Silver Beach (Haven Point, Book 8) - RaeAnne Thayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Years after betraying her, he’s back in Haven Point…and ready to learn the truth&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Megan Hamilton never really liked Elliot Bailey. He turned his back on her family when they needed him the most and it almost tore them all apart. So she’s shocked when Elliot arrives at her family’s inn, needing a place to stay and asking questions that dredge up the past. Megan will rent him a cottage, but that’s where it ends—no matter how gorgeous Elliot has become.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Coming back home to Haven Point was the last thing bestselling writer Elliot Bailey thought he’d ever do. But the book he’s writing now is his most personal one yet and it’s drawn him back to the woman he can’t get out of his mind. Seeing Megan again is harder than he expected and it brings up feelings he’d thought were long buried. Could this be his chance to win over his first love?&lt;/p&gt;
