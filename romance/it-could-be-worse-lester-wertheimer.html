  <title>It Could Be Worse - Lester Wertheimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peter Newman is the good one. He&#39;s the one who follows the rules, gets good grades, and leads an exemplary life. Then one day his high school girlfriend says, &quot;I might be pregnant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
Peter&#39;s story begins as war clouds are gathering in Europe. His uprooted family makes the arduous journey down Route 66, winding from Chicago to L.A. New schools, new friends, and new adventures are set against the developing war. Peter survives the war years as he matures, falls in love, and discovers the exhilaration of sexual activity. Unrestrained exploits result in adult-sized problems, and our teenage hero struggles to overcome his misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
In a narrative filled with anticipation, humor, and the emotional torments of youth, Peter Newman&#39;s loving family provides encouragement as they continue to remind him-&lt;i&gt;It Could Be Worse&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
