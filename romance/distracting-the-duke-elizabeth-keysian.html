Unfortunately, her vastly opinionated, frustrating, and lamentably beautiful guardian, Lady Clara Tinniswood, keeps distracting him, tempting him to consider a far more tempestuous--and passionate--union.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently widowed Lady Clara Tinniswood wants only to organize a quiet new life for herself, beyond the control of any man. But one shockingly unguarded moment while confronted by Marcus&#39;s gloriously naked body catapults her headlong into a forbidden passion and threatens to undermine all her well-laid plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if Marcus abandons his sweet ideal and surrenders to his growing desire for Clara, there&#39;s still one thing that could destroy their hopes forever...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Wayward in Wessex series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Distracting the Duke&lt;br&gt;* Unmasking the Earl&lt;br&gt;* Vanquishing the Viscount&lt;/p&gt;" />
