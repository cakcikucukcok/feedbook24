  <title>One Night with a Tempting Playboy: From Playboy to Papa! / The Legendary Playboy Surgeon / Unwrapping the Playboy (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Leanne Banks, Alison Roberts, Marie Ferrarella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;They can have any woman they want – and they do! Once Rafe Medici learned he had an heir, he was determined to get the child under his roof. Only the boy’s guardian, Nicole Livingstone, stood in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If it took seduction to win over Nicole, Rafe was happy to oblige. Connor Matthews has to be the only surgeon ever to ride his motorbike into ER! And Kate Graham disapproves, although it makes a sick little boy’s dream come true. Even so Connor’s sinful sexiness is critically close to cracking the shield around Kate’s fragile heart. As rakishly handsome as he was successful, attorney Kullen Manetti was a love ’em and leave ’em kind of guy. Until Lilli McCall, his long-lost love, suddenly appeared in his office, needing his expert help to fight for what mattered most: her young son.&lt;/p&gt;
