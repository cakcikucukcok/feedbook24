  <title>The Undefeated - Paul Colella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1763, and the French and Indian War is taking a toll on the colonists, British soldiers, and their Indian allies. As two men on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean struggle with internal demons, both have no idea that they are about to become entangled with a seductive, mysterious woman who has devious intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As surgeon Thomas Gage skillfully operates on one soldier after the other, he knows he must decide whether to pursue his medical career or fulfill his mothers wishes to marry and carry on the family legacy. Meanwhile, Richard Hayes, a high-ranking officer in the British army, is desperately searching Boston for an evil swindler. He has one year to retrieve the money and clear his name before he is sent to prison. In an ironic twist of fate, Gages mother has a chance encounter with Margaret Ann Thatcher, the niece of a wealthy merchant whose temptations are about to lead her into a forbidden relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one war ends, a battle between good and evil rages on as the lives of three vastly different characters become intertwined in a web of treachery, greed, and insurmountable challenges that only the resilient will survive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
