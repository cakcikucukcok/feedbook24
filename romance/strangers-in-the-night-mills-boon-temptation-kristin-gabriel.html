          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josie&#39;s Scheme for Seduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Sneak into Adam&#39;s apartment&lt;br /&gt;2. Slip out of her clothes and under the sheets&lt;br /&gt;3. Have the best sex of her life… with the wrong man?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Librarian Josie Sinclair has never been wild or spontaneous…but she&#39;s about to make up for it now. Her plan? To surprise her boyfriend, Adam Delaney, by stealing in to his apartment…and seducing him within an inch of his life. But in the morning it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Josie&lt;/em&gt; who gets the surprise. Because the man she&#39;s just slept with is Adam Delaney–only, he&#39;s not her boyfriend….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Adam quickly realizes that the mystery woman in his bed isn&#39;t a fantasy come true–it&#39;s a case of mistaken identity. But when he discovers that some other man has been using his name and his apartment for the past three months, he&#39;s livid. He&#39;s going to find the impostor, or else. But his first priority is to convince Josie that there&#39;s nothing like the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; thing….&lt;/p&gt;
