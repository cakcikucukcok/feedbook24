  <title>The Baron&#39;s Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Historical) - Joanna Makepeace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Gisela of Brinkhurst enjoyed managing her father&#39;s keep and had never thought much about marriage. Little did she foresee the threats to her father&#39;s lands and how marriage would ensure their survival.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sir Alain de Treville needed a wife, and there was no better time than when the king placed him in Allestone Castle to protect the area from daring marauders. When nearby Brinkhurst was attacked, and Lady Gisela&#39;s family suffered great losses, it was time for him to insist on their union, despite the beautiful maiden&#39;s indifference to marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Would the brave Gisela give in to her growing love for Alain–a man who showed her every day how much he adored her?&lt;/p&gt;
