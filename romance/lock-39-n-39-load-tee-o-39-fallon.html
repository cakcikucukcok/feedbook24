      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Crack CIA analyst Trista Gold is a whiz with the computer, but not so much with people.  She hides behind her job, analyzing Top Secret code and making recommendations on national security. She doesn&#39;t need a man in her life.

But he doesn&#39;t dare act on his attraction. He&#39;s a loner and always will be. Keeping away from Trista is a must-do directive. Until he doesn&#39;t have a choice...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During a routine assignment, Trista stumbles across a cryptic exchange. She doesn&#39;t think much of it...until someone tries to murder her--twice. Both times, Matt had been there to save her.  But now she has to hide. And her new bodyguard, Matt, and his K-9 are the only hope she has against the powerful forces that want her dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Federal K-9 series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Lock &#39;N&#39; Load&lt;br&gt;* Armed &#39;N&#39; Ready&lt;br&gt;* Dark &#39;N&#39; Deadly&lt;br&gt;* Trap &#39;N&#39; Trace&lt;/p&gt;" />
