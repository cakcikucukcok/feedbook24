  <title>The Earl Next Door - Amelia Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does a fiercely independent young widow really want? One determined suitor is about to find out. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Adeline, Dowager Countess of Wake, learns of her husband&#39;s sudden death, she realizes she&#39;s free. At last, she can do, go, and &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; as she pleases. Finally, she can have the life she has always dreamed of. She doesn&#39;t need, or &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt;, to remarry. Especially not the supremely dashing future Marquis of Marksworth, who makes Adeline yearn for his desire. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Lyonwood, son of a philandering marquis, will not be like his father. He wants to run his estates and watch them flourish--and find a wife who brings love to his life. When he meets spirited and self-reliant Adeline in a case of near-scandalous mistaken identity, Lyon feels he&#39;s met his match. But Adeline isn&#39;t interested in a marriage proposal. She will only accept becoming his lover--and Lyon finds it hard to refuse. Unless the fire of his passion can melt Adeline&#39;s resolve. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A master storyteller.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Affaire de Coeur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
