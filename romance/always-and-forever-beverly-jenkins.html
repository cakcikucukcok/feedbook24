  <title>Always and Forever - Beverly Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A desperate need &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sassy Grace Atwood never expected to find her proper self accidentally tumbling into a stranger&#39;s bed. If she weren&#39;t desperate for a man to lead a wagon train of brides to a woman-starved town out West, she never would have gone near Jackson Blake-former lawman or not. She should send the ruggedly charming Texan packing...only he&#39;s perfect for the job. Now if her mind would just stop going blank every time she looked at him, they might get this train to Kansas yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A comsuming passion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s a man to do when a beautiful woman leans over his bed in the middle of the night? Come to think of it, that was the only time Blake&#39;s ever seen the straitlaced Miss Atwood the least bit ruffled. He&#39;s certain that beneath her buttoned-up appearance lies a passionate woman aching to break free. But though Blake longs to take her in his arms, all he can offer Grace is a life on the run. And when the demons from his past catch up with them, Blake is couaght between the ties that bind and a love that could last...always and forever. &lt;/p&gt;" />
