      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Texas was ablaze with murder and corruption, but Dawson Gray was used to the heat. High-pressure situations couldn&#39;t shake the ex-army heavy hitter; he was forged in them. Having no fear for his own life, he signed on with the Lone Star Agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assigned as a bodyguard, Dawson was all over Savvy Jones&amp;mdash;if that was her real name. Caught in a frame-up, Savvy didn&#39;t remember who she was, and his first task as her bodyguard was to jog her memory. His second? To make sure that the drug cartel targeting her didn&#39;t harm a hair on her sweet head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Savvy began to mean more to him than just a case, Dawson found that there was one thing he did fear&amp;mdash;losing her forever. And that wasn&#39;t going to happen on his watch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
