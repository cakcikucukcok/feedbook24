  <title>Ten Ways To Win Her Man (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Beverly Bird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;She was the hotshot CEO of a multimillion-dollar company. But when it came to Maxwell Padgett, Danielle Harrington was lost. Though he was too arrogant, he was also too darn &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;–to let get away! What she needed to win &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; man was a plan….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maxwell Padgett had never been so irritated–or so &lt;em&gt;aroused&lt;/em&gt;–in all his life! Every time he turned around, the vulnerable beauty who was messing up all his plans was plying him with home-cooked meals and soul-stealing kisses. Why, if he didn&#39;t know Dani Harrington better, he might have believed she had more than business on her mind. Was it possible Maxwell had miscalculated the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; power of this mesmerizing millionairess?&lt;/p&gt;
