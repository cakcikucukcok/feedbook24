  <title>I Dream of Danger - Lisa Marie Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are the Ghost Ops: a covert squad of super-elite soldiers. After their team was betrayed and massacred, the three surviving members went underground and built Haven, a community of misfits and geniuses. Now they&#39;re at a crossroads, facing a new threat capable of destroying everything they hold dear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Nick Ross disappears from Elle Thomason&#39;s life, she is certain she&#39;ll never see the man she loves again&amp;#8212;except in her dreams. Ten years later, as a respected researcher breaking new ground in psychic phenomena, she sends a desperate call for Nick&#39;s help. One by one, her colleagues have started disappearing . . . and Elle knows she&#39;s next. An elite soldier, Nick never meant to hurt Elle, duty kept him away&amp;#8212;and then she vanished. Now troubled by unusually vivid, disturbing dreams of Elle in danger, Nick will rescue the only woman he&#39;s ever wanted and bring her back with him to Haven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though powerful men are after Elle and her special abilities, Nick will die before leaving her side again. &lt;/p&gt;" />
