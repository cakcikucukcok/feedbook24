          &lt;strong&gt;The Westmoreland Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Rancher Returns&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Returning from duty to find his ranch being dug up by a beautiful stranger isn’t the homecoming Navy SEAL Gavin Blake expected. Layla Harris is convinced there’s buried treasure on his land. But the only treasure Gavin wants to uncover is the professor’s secret desires!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;His Secret Son&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Texas rancher and navy SEAL who fathered Bristol Lockett&#39;s son died a hero&#39;s death…or so she was told. Yet when Laramie “Coop” Cooper strolls into her exhibit at an art gallery three years later, he’s very much alive—and still making her pulse zing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;An Honourable Seduction&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;David Holloway is used to hard assignments. Now he faces his most difficult yet: cozying up to the soft curves of Swan Jamison. He wants to know the island beauty…in every way. But romancing Swan as part of his SEAL team’s mission tests his honour. Soon he must make a choice: duty…or desire?&lt;/p&gt;
