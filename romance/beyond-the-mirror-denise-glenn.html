From an early age, she learns about Gods love from her adoring parents; even better, they show her that love by making their home the center of neighborhood activity. Its open and hospitable to anyone, especially to Charleses neighbor and best friend, Walker. The young friends share everything from secrets to snacks, and are never far apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;But when her mother dies suddenly, Charleses wonderful and carefree world shatters. She leans heavily on those around her and tries to adjust to her devastating loss, but as she grows older it becomes harder for her to deal with her mothers absence especially when confronted with the mysteries of puberty and boys.

She feels like God abandoned her many years ago and she can handle things on her own. But when she reconnects with Walker, everything from her past comes roaring back. She realizes she can no longer run from God and learns a hard yet valuable lesson in true friendship, trust, and self worth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Full of faith and hope, Beyond the Mirror is a heartwarming and captivating story of devotion, loss and love.
