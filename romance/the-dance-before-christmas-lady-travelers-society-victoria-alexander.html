          &lt;strong&gt;A fake fiancé and Christmas engagement are a recipe for trouble!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miss Anabel Snelling needs fiancé, and fast. If her father Sir Archibald has his way, she’ll be married in time for Christmas – to a man she doesn’t love. That’s why she and her aunt have concocted a brilliant plan to hire an American actor to play the role of her suitor.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the charming Wesley Grant is playing the part a little too well, and Anabel is in danger of falling for him. What Anabel doesn&#39;t know is Wesley is not the actor her aunt hired. Still, what kind of a gentleman would he be if he didn’t come to her rescue? He has a new plan of his own – win Annabel’s heart…for real.&lt;/p&gt;
