  <title>A Week To Be Wild: New for 2018: The hot billionaire romance book from Mills &amp; Boon’s sexiest series yet. Perfect for fans of Darker! (Mills &amp; Boon Dare) - Jc Harroway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;‘Brace yourself. You are in for a hot and steamy ride.’ **** &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A daring game of temptation&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;She’ll play his game—but only by her rules!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alex Lancaster is an adrenaline junkie. He’s also a sexy British billionaire who should come with his own warning signs. When Libby insists she is done with men who live on the edge, Alex coaxes her out of her comfort zone—professionally and very, very personally. Libby’s taking a high-stakes gamble, but the pay-off could win her everything…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘It’s &lt;strong&gt;passionate&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; and it’s damn well &lt;strong&gt;sexy&lt;/strong&gt;!’ &lt;em&gt;Amy Wright , Netgalley reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Think I need a cold shower after reading this new offering from the Mills &amp; Boon Dare line! They&#39;ve gone &lt;strong&gt;super steamy&lt;/strong&gt; for 2018 and this was a great start to the series and I thoroughly enjoyed it! This is fabulous escapism in bookish form! It is a very steamy and graphic book and won&#39;t be for everyone – not sure my Nan who used to read Mills &amp; Boon would have approved! – but I found it to be an enthralling, sizzling sexy read and I am really looking forward to reading more of the Dare series if they are all going to be this good!’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Karen Mace, NetGalley reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Well, I was right to be excited by the new Dare line!&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed JC Harroway&#39;s writing! I was instantly invested in Libby and Alex&#39;s story and their motivation. I love that she takes charge, that she sets the rules. And I love that Alex lets her! If this book is anything to go by, I am now even more excited for the Dare line! JC Harroway is an author I will definitely read more of. &lt;strong&gt;A fresh, sexy and enjoyable read!&lt;/strong&gt;’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracy Rogers, NetGalley reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
