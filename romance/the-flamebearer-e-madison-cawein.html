  <title>The Flamebearer - E. Madison Cawein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Abandoned by his Faery mother in infancy, the Cambrian prince, Ciaran ap Morgan, loses his beloved father to death at the hands of Norman border lords when he is still a boy . Raised by his mortal uncle and trained as a warrior, he dreams of blood and glory, driven by a fierce desire for revenge and a restless, fiery spirit. 
His destiny changes the moment he meets the mortal girl he calls his &quot;dark lady.&quot; Despite his best-laid plans, he finds that instead of longing for battle, he is beset with dreams of love. 
For the maiden Evaine, the future holds little expectation for joy. In a culture that glorifies war and devalues the feminine, she resigns herself to a life of sacrifice in a loveless marriage arranged long ago by her family to keep the peace. The passionate and enigmatic prince breaks open her heart, awakening her to a promise of love she had never dared to dream. 
On the eve of her wedding, the two secretly confess to a mysterious and overpowering mutual attraction that feels like the reuniting of souls. But can they prevent the preordained marriage, defeat the ruthless Norman overlord, and follow the path of their hearts without provoking a bloody private war they cannot hope to win? Now that they have found each other, can they face the looming prospect of separation and a lifetime of loneliness without love?" />
