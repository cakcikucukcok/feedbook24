      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;By day, these agents are cowboys: by night they are specialized government operatives. Men bound by love, loyalty and the law–they&#39;ve vowed to keep their missions and identities confidential&amp;#133.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE MISSION: ESCORT AN EXPECTANT MOTHER… TO THE ENEMY?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cody Gannon had never belonged anywhere until he&#39;d joined Texas Confidential, but now even that haven had become uncertain. Cody was along again, and determined to prove himself….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But was turning in single mother-to-be Sarah Rand the way to do it? He&#39;d been told she was the enemy, but her vulnerable green eyes told a different story. Someone had lured them both into the open and would stop at nothing to get the information Sarah carried with her. And now with Sarah&#39;s condition and his newfound love for her a priority, Cody came to a hard realization. To keep Sarah safe, he would have to break the law….&lt;/p&gt;
