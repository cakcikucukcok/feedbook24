  <title>Into the Prairie - Rosanne Bittner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With her Westward America! novels, beloved novelist Rosanne Bittner tells the personal stories of some of the brave pioneers who settled this country&#39;s early wilderness at great personal risk. Deftly combining soul-stirring romance with true American history, Bittner creates a world in which brave men and women make the greatest sacrifices possible to see their dreams made reality---and with them, the dreams of a young nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah Wilde has always had an untamed spirit, and he will stop at nothing to achieve his dream of building a farming empire in the wild prairies of Indiana. But in 1810, the Shawnee Indians still call these prairies home, and a disastrous and violent encounter with the Shawnee changes everything for the Wilde family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah&#39;s young wife, Sadie, and his three-year-old son, Paul, are left to fend for themselves at Tippecanoe. Her dreams in tatters, Sadie doesn&#39;t know whether she&#39;ll have the strength to go on. Sadie and Paul&#39;s fate lies in the hands of the Powatomi leader, Windigo, and his Shawnee counterpart, the notorious Tecumseh. Will their lives be spared? And if they live, will they ever return to the life Sadie dreamt of with Jonah?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bestselling and beloved author Rosanne Bittner will break your heart as she brings to life the stories of the brave pioneers who settled, shaped, and died for the young nation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
