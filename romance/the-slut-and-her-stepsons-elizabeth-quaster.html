  <title>The Slut and Her Stepsons - Elizabeth Quaster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Zoe marries a man with two demanding sons do their best to humiliate her.&amp;nbsp; However, she realizes that she loves the humiliation and happily does all that is asked of her.&amp;nbsp; Playing the game between her husband and his sons it goes from level to the next level until there are no more barriers, thinking she has it all, but she doesn&amp;#39;t know about her husband&amp;rsquo;s last barrier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I knew what I was in for and there was no sense in protesting so when we walked in the apartment for the next hour or so, and while they were drinking, I was slapped around some more and I had to give all three of them blowjobs.&amp;nbsp; Something happened that night, even after I showered and went to bed alone I felt dirty&amp;hellip;really dirty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ashamed I avoided Steve for two weeks then on Friday after I was walking through the parking garage I saw my car was gone.&amp;nbsp; I knew right away Pete took it and I kicked myself in the ass for letting him talk me into giving him my spare key.&amp;nbsp; I called Pete to ask him to pick me up and he told me to call a cab because he was in Savannah and he was going to spend the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What, with a friend?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No we&amp;rsquo;ll be staying in a Hotel.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; He replied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You know we don&amp;rsquo;t have any money. Who&amp;rsquo;s paying for it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He hung up the phone and having sold most of my jewelry to put the money in my account that I had hidden, I started to panic.&amp;nbsp; Calling him back when he answered, I said &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me you found it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve been holding out on me bitch,&amp;rdquo; and he hung up the phone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Realizing he had found it I did what every woman in my shoes did, I lost it.&amp;nbsp; I really lost it, breaking down and crying I wandered through the parking garage, found a spot and sat down.&amp;nbsp; I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t lady like sitting there but I didn&amp;rsquo;t give a shit that my skirt was hiked up to my waist and I was giving every passerby a panty shot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So while I was sitting there not knowing how I was going to go home when Steve walked up, &amp;ldquo;Boyfriend took your car again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I just nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a lift home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As soon we were in the car, he said, &amp;ldquo;I hope you didn&amp;rsquo;t get into any trouble the other night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to tell him that he and his friends slapped me around and I had to give all three of them a blowjob. &amp;ldquo;Just a little,&amp;rdquo; I replied." />
