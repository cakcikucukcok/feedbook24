  <title>Bad for You - J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;If you&#39;re a fan of Kristen Ashley, then you will love this book.&quot; -- Aestas Book Blog on &lt;i&gt;Four Letter Word&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  He didn&#39;t want to be bad. He just didn&#39;t have a choice...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Shayla Perkins isn&#39;t the kind of girl who makes the same mistake twice, especially when it comes to Sean &quot;Stitch&quot; Molina. So when he gives her the world&#39;s biggest rejection, that&#39;s it--she&#39;s done. Until the sexy, silent, unavailable Sean makes Shay a very personal offer. Of course, it still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s interested in her. Or does it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Sean has done things in life. Bad things. And he&#39;s paid the price. All he wants now is to make up for his past by doing good in the present. And no one deserves more good than Shay. Beautiful on the inside and out, Shay is the kind of woman who should be cared for and protected--especially from a man like Sean. He&#39;s tried to keep his feelings for her in check, but a single, reckless impulse pulls them closer than ever before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Soon the two are sharing their biggest dreams and satisfying their deepest desires. But what will happen if the only way to truly give each other what they want most...is to let each other go?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;The perfect mix of funny, hot and heartwarming. I enjoyed it immensely!&quot; -- Mia Sheridan, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, on &lt;i&gt;Four Letter Word&lt;/i&gt;" />

Daniels</i></b> | I’m not excusing whatever it is you did. But I’m also not trying to close this place down while I wait for somebody else to come in here asking to get hired. That can’t happen. So, unless you tell me something I really can’t look past in order to give you a chance, yes, I’m still looking to hire you. Job’s yours if you want it.”<br /><b><i>Bad for You - J. Daniels</i></b> | Bad for You is the third installment in J. Daniels Dirty Deeds series. It reads as a complete standalone with just a few appearances from other Dirty Deeds characters. Although it can be read perfectly fine by itself, I absolutely recommend reading Four Letter Word and Hit the Spot ahead of time. “He didn't feel worthy.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Bad for You - J.
