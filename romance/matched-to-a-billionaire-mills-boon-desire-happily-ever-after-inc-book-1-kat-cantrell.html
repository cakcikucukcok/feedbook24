        &lt;p&gt;Wanted: one convenient wife&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Venture capitalist Leo Reynolds is married to his work, but now he needs a wife. Someone to run his home, host his parties–and accept a marriage that&#39;s strictly business. His one rule: love will play no part in their union. At least that&#39;s the lie he tells himself, until he meets his match….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enter Daniella White–handpicked by the matchmaker as the perfect wife. Marriage to Leo means security, and she&#39;s willing to give up passion for friendship. But the moment they meet, sparks fly. And now temptation–and Leo&#39;s own heart–have the billionaire ready to change all the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
