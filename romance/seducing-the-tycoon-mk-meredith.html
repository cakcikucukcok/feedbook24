Drago has to protect Nonna&#39;s inn, even if it means getting close enough to Chase to convince her she needs to leave. But the more time he spends with Chase, the more he&#39;s drawn to her passion, her love of his culture, and the way she looks in those Louis Vuitton heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Huntington would give anything to enjoy her time with charming, sexy-as-hell Drago in the style capital of the world, but she has to make sure the new Huntington hotel opens successfully.
