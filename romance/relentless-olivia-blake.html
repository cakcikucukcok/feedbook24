  <title>Relentless - Olivia Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Mckenzie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Seth Garrett didn&amp;rsquo;t look like a teacher. His deep set, green-gray eyes regarded the world with weary cynicism from a face that was too hard, too angled, to be classically handsome. Ever since I&amp;rsquo;d moved into his class in January I&amp;rsquo;d spent hours memorizing the stark lines and planes of that face until I could see it perfectly in my mind. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a girl at school who hadn&amp;rsquo;t sighed over him, and fantasized about him at least a little.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But I was the one who was going to get him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Seth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to want her. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to want her. I was her teacher, she was my student, and the whole situation was a disaster in the making. I should have gone to someone for help. I should have had her transferred to another class. I should have kept my temper and libido firmly in check when she was in the room. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any of those things. Maybe it was because forbidden fruit really is the sweetest, or maybe it was just because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t done self-destructing yet. Either way, I did nothing to stop it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And then it was too late.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Relentless&lt;/b&gt; is a four part serial with cliffhanger endings. If you don&amp;#39;t like serials and you don&amp;#39;t like cliffhanger endings, I will be releasing a novelized version with all four installments when the series is finished." />
