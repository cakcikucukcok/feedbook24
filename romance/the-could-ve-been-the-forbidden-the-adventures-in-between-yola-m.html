  <title>The Could’Ve Been.  the Forbidden.  the Adventures in Between. - Yola_M</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet Jodi Porter, a strongly dominant young lady who comes across and finds herself lured by the Forbidden Fruits, just shortly after sacrificing what Couldve Been her life-line, for her career. When a Forbidden fling with the dashy Kathleen Montgomery unexpectedly turns into a roller fusion of falling in love, marriages leading to heartbreaks and disappointment; Lady-Robot-Jo swears off matters of the heart and starts a whole string of Adventures in Between.
The intrigue unfolds when the highly irresistible Forbidden returns back to town, and claims her position back in Jodi Porters life. Feelings are triggered, theres jealousy, betrayal and a whole lot of more heartaches in between. Jo is reminded of her Couldve Been, a clean and hassle-free invaluable relationship which ended due to her mega career-fervent trait.
The more the line becomes visible with the Forbidden, the higher the temptations to cross it; with the hovering thought in mind that once it has been crossed it may never be possible to go back. It is ungovernably tempting for her to yield back in, but will Jo survive sharing her Fruits? Even so, will she ever be willing to exclusively share herself with anyone else, if she tried? Having reached the crossroads, Lady Robot has some serious decisions to make.
