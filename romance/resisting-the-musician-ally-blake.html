  <title>Resisting the Musician - Ally Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bridal shoe company owner Lori Hanover is in way over her head. First, her designer sister has fallen head over heels for the rock star fiancé of a client - talk about bad PR! Now her business is falling apart.  Lori&#39;s only hope in saving her company is making the world believe it was true love, even if she&#39;s not so sure herself.  Her best bet? A song.  For this she turns to the most frustrating musical recluse in America, Dash Mills, a man who could pass for Thor&#39;s sexier brother. And even though this former rock superstar agrees to help, it comes at a price...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lori agrees to Dash&#39;s terms, he thinks she&#39;s the one in for a challenge. But the more time he spends with this spitfire bombshell, the more tempted he is to play her--in more ways than one. But Dash left behind the rock and roll life for a reason.  And seductive as Lori may be, if she drags him back into that world, this time he won&#39;t forgive himself...or her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
