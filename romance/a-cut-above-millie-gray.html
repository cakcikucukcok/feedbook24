  <title>A Cut Above - Millie Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It’s 1962 and Freda Scott and her five schoolmates are eager to embark on their life journeys. Madly in love with the dashing but unattainable Ewan, Freda instead throws herself into a hairdressing career, and soon she and her best friend Robin have established their own flourishing business. The future looks rosy, until Freda’s life is turned upside down by a brutal attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Freda struggles to come to terms with what has happened to her, she relies on her old friends more than ever. Dear Robin and Freda’s ever-faithful friend Hannah come to her rescue, and Freda accepts the new path her life has taken. However, a chance meeting with her old love Ewan brings a potentially life-changing dilemma. Does Freda dare to finally put herself and her own desires first? Or should she simply accept her lot in life? The consequences of her decision could change all of their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millie Gray once again brilliantly recreates the atmosphere of the era with all the hardships and struggles as well as the fun, warmth and humour of everyday life. &lt;i&gt;A Cut Above&lt;/i&gt; is a charming, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting novel of enduring friendship and love, and the lengths that true friends will go to for each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
