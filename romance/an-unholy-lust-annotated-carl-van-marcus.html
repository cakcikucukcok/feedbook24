  <title>An Unholy Lust (Annotated) - Carl Van Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She was her husbands, his entirely -- and she was Pete&amp;#39;s too as well as Tim&amp;#39;s woman. Obviously Randy didn&amp;#39;t care; he probably would be introducing her soon to his other girlfriends, why couldn&amp;#39;t they share that way? Would it would make them closer as a couple and could they grow from their loving ways? Would she feel freed, liberated from her old ideas of sexual morality? Is menage the ultimate solution to a boring marriage?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come off it baby,&amp;rdquo; Al Cortini sneered, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;#39;t tell me you didn&amp;#39;t know I would want a little piece of your ass for a show. You&amp;#39;ve wiggled it at me enough by this time to excite me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, as he massaged at the tender softness of her breasts, he pulled her back against him until she felt the hardness of his erect penis grinding into the small of her back.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mr. Cortini,&amp;rdquo; please stop she pleaded and yet already she realized that she wasn&amp;#39;t resisting him as much as she could have done, already there were delicious sensations spreading from her tingling breasts, warming her belly and deep in her loins, a tiny flame of arousal seared her. She could hardly believe that it was happening to her, she was quite contented with her husband Randy even though he was away a little more on business than she cared for... still she had never dreamed of being unfaithful to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Stop!&amp;rdquo; she shouted out now, jumping up from the couch and running to the door only to find that it had been locked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turning back to the gallery owner now she gasped in amazement as he pulled the couch out into a double bed and she shuddered as she realized that soon she would be on her back on it. Her eyes traveled to Al Cortini now as he began to strip off his clothes, revealing his stubby body and paunchy belly to her horrified gaze. Her eyes were drawn like a magnet to his monster cock-shaft, standing out at an acute angle from his loins. She could see the throbbing beat of his heart in it; below his testicles hung free in the sagging sac of his scrotum, but even as she watched, she saw the slow contractions as it was drawn up and became more wrinkled and tight, pulling his balls tip closer to his body. Julie knew that his penis was much too large, that it would never be able to fit into the petite opening of her vagina. God! she thought, he&amp;#39;ll tear me apart. She remembered how painful it had been the first time that Randy had made love to her and his cock was no-where near the size of Al Cortini&amp;#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Strip baby,&amp;rdquo; she heard him growl. Julie made a snap decision there and then, she wanted a one woman show, she would do whatever it took to get one, even this lewd act. She unzipped her mini skirt and let it fall to the floor, then she pulled off her tight cotton knit top revealing her luscious white tits trembling before his lascivious gaze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Damn! You&amp;#39;re a lovely piece!&amp;rdquo; Cortini told her, his jaw going slack and his lecherous eyes widening with salacious desire as he gaped at her, seeing the curvaceous shapeliness of her legs, her smoothly tapered thighs and her flimsy black panties. She had not been able to tear her eyes away from the hardened, thick length of his cock, and as she watched, she saw his hand grip it. With a lewd leer, he stroked his cock-shaft, withdrawing the loose and heavy foreskin, the blood-filled head seeming to slide out like some primeval serpent monster wriggling out of its lair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Like it baby,&amp;rdquo; he grinned lewdly. &amp;ldquo;Just wait till I shove it in that tight little cunt of yours. Then you&amp;#39;ll know that you&amp;#39;ve really been fucked.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No! No! No!&amp;rdquo; she screamed wildly thinking of a way to escape from his evil clutches." />
