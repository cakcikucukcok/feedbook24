  <title>The Last True Vampire - Kate Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As &lt;i&gt;Michael&#39;s eyes lit on a female not twenty feet away, he knew without a doubt that it was her blood that called to him and her scent that had awakened him.This female had tethered his soul and returned it to him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOUL SURVIVOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;He is the last of his race. The one true king of the vampires. Michael Aristov roams the nightclubs of L.A. after dark, haunted by his past and driven by his hunger. The last of the Ancient Ones, he alone has survived the destruction of his race at the hands of the slayers. Now he is forced to hunt and feed like a common vampire, a creature of lust. Nothing in this world can fulfill his needs...until he meets a woman who&#39;s everything he&#39;s ever wanted. And more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SWEET SALVATION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Her name is Claire Thompson. Her blood is so sweet, so intoxicating--the smell alone draws Michael to her like a moth to the flame. Sly, sexy, and seductive, Claire seems to be the only mortal who can satisfy his craving and seal his fate...&lt;i&gt;forever&lt;/i&gt;. Can she be trusted? From their very first kiss, the last true vampire sweeps Claire into a world in which darkness rules desire--and where falling in love is the greatest danger of all...in &lt;i&gt;The Last True Vampire &lt;/i&gt;by Kate Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First in the thrilling new series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
