  <title>Daddy’s Forbidden Desire - Vol. 1 - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
When Dale&#39;s wife decides she&#39;s no longer interested in sex, this passionate, hard-working husband becomes desperate for release. That&#39;s when Katie, his headstrong daughter, returns from college and decides to take matters into her own hands. As Katie tempts her father at every turn, will Dale give in to this forbidden desire? She&#39;s not going to take no for an answer!
EXCERPT
The sound of his daughter&#39;s heels rapped loudly in their foyer. Dale leaned back from the refrigerator to look into the main hall that opened into their living room. He briefly let out a relaxed groan as the cool air hit his abdominals (brutal hours at the gym did wonders for sublimating his baser urges). Katie caught his eye silently as she perched on one leg and undid the straps on her platform sandals. She let the sandal drop (louder than she intended), then uncurled her beautiful leg to stand and repeat the process with her other. She smiled at him.
She put her purse and coat on the table with her keys and crept to him on her toes. The soft carpet muffled her steps but she was pretending to be stealthy. He shook his head and returned to his survey of the refrigerator.
&quot;You&#39;re still up,&quot; she whispered into his ear.
&quot;Mmhm,&quot; he grunted.
&quot;Are you mad at me?&quot; she pouted at him.
&quot;Mm-mm,&quot; he grunted.
&quot;Oh, Da-ddy,&quot; she teased, tugging at his shoulders. She pressed herself against him in her shimmering top and hung from his back. He felt her chest nestle softly under his armpit. &quot;You&#39;re not hungry,&quot; she chided him.
&quot;No,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Just can&#39;t sleep.&quot; His daughter giggled. He turned to her. Her luminous eyes shined up at him, lovingly, her face flushed and tinged with humor. She had been drinking, a little. He could also smell it on her breath, which she knew; but she knew he knew. &quot;What&#39;s funny?&quot; he said.
&quot;Nothing,&quot; she said, biting her tongue between her front teeth. That expression always made him want to grab her and squeeze her until she relented in her teases. 
&quot;Dad, do you and mom have sex?&quot; She strode to him and let him catch her as she draped her arms over him. She was sleepy, staring up at him. &quot;Don&#39;t pretend I&#39;m too young to hear the truth.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; he said. How did one proceed in this conversation? &quot;Well,&quot; he said again. And finally, &quot;No, Katie, your mother and I don&#39;t really have sex that much anymore.&quot;
Katie stared up at him with something akin to sympathy and something very much like loneliness. &quot;Vanessa said you kind of had a reputation at college.&quot;
&quot;What kind of repu—&quot;
&quot;She said you fucked. A lot.&quot; Katie smirked. &quot;And that you were very...gifted.&quot;
Dale&#39;s head swam. He became intensely aware of his daughter&#39;s breasts pressed against his chest. She continued, &quot;And I was thinking about that. I kind of couldn&#39;t stop because, um, you&#39;re my dad? But, I was thinking how I never thought of you that way. Mostly because,&quot; she looked at him intensely, &quot;I don&#39;t think I ever heard you having sex. With mom.&quot;
&quot;Katie, I don&#39;t think this is appropriate.&quot;
&quot;OK,&quot; she said. &quot;So you and mom don&#39;t have sex?&quot;
&quot;Katie—&quot;
&quot;But you used to have a lot of sex back in the day. And now you just don&#39;t have sex at all?&quot;
&quot;Katie—&quot;
&quot;That sounds like it really sucks, Dad. Does it suck? Does it suck, daddy?&quot;
