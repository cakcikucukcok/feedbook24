  <title>The Duke&#39;s Wife (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Stephanie Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;ROYAL AFFAIR&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Duchess&#39;s dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Duty ruled Damiano&#39;s life: duty to his country, his people and his baby son, but not, Sofia thought, to his wife. She knew that her wedding to the Duke of San Rinaldo had been just a matter of convenience, but it appeared that even his old flames figured more highly than her. Now, to end the rumors about their marriage, Damiano was insisting that they convince the world that theirs was a love match.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It seemed that Sofia had gotten what she had always wanted–a &quot;devoted&quot; husband by her side–but would this fairy-tale romance ever have a real happy ending?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Romancing a royal was easy, marriage another affair!&lt;/strong&gt;
