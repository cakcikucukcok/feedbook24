        &lt;p&gt;Rio Redtree had never recovered from his teenage sweetheart&#39;s betrayal. Eve Stuart had left him without a word of explanation, and through six years had passed, the fire still burned within him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now suddenly Eve was back - along with her five year old daughter, Molly who jet black hair spoke of her Native American Heritage. His daughter Rio would lay down his life for her - and for Eve, try as he might to deny it. But that was what his enemies were counting on. And soon Rio&#39;s love was put to to ultimate test..&lt;/p&gt;
