  <title>The Wedding-Night Affair (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Miranda Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She&#39;d fallen in love again - with her ex-husband! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fiona was the successful co-owner of Five Star Weddings - the wedding coodinators as far as Sydney&#39;s society set was concerned. Which was how she got to organize her ex-husband Philip&#39;s forthcoming marriage. Fiona quickly realized she still loved Philip, but she was determined to resist the chemistry that still bubbled between them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her job was to make sure that the wedding of the year went without a hitch… even after the bride made a stunning revelation - and Fiona found herself agreeing to be Philip&#39;s stand-in wife! They&#39;re gorgeous, they&#39;re glamorous… and they&#39;re getting married!&lt;/p&gt;
