  <title>Can&#39;t Let Her Go - Sandy James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Nashville the music is louder, the dreams are bigger, and love can bring a cowboy to his knees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ethan Walker is Nashville royalty. Born to the King and Queen of Country Music, he&#39;s spent his life trying to escape the spotlight of his parents&#39; fame, even walking away from his own promising singing career. He&#39;s the kind of cowboy who prefers flannel to flashbulbs, hay fields to hit records, and the solitude of his horse farm to the nightlife along Music Row. The last thing he wants is attention, especially when it comes from country&#39;s latest star... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Chelsea Harris&#39;s meteoric rise up the charts and string of celebrity boyfriends mean that wherever she goes, the paparazzi follow. A duet with Nashville&#39;s favorite son is exactly what her new charity album needs, but when she approaches Ethan, he turns her down flat. To win the camera-shy cowboy over, Chelsea will have to approach him on his terms. Trouble is, the more time she spends on his farm, the more Ethan wants to keep her there." />
