  <title>Stuck On You - Cheryl Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take a chance on love in the limelight with Cheryl Harper&amp;#39;s fun and flirty new series set in the wacky Elvis-themed Rock&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;Rolla Hotel. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big shot producer KT Masters never apologizes. Especially not to showgirl waitresses. But when he tears Laura Charles&amp;#39;s feathered costume and she gives him a piece of her mind, it sets him aflame. In fact, between Laura&amp;#39;s feisty temper and how damn good she looks in that little number, KT wouldn&amp;#39;t mind seeing a lot more of that costume . . . balled up next to his bed, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite KT&amp;#39;s arrogant attitude, Laura can&amp;#39;t help but be drawn to him. And when he offers her the fling of a lifetime&amp;#8212;a week spent in his gorgeous celebrity arms&amp;#8212;she&amp;#39;s willing to play along . . . just so long as her heart stays out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as things heat up between them, going back to the way things were isn&amp;#39;t so easy. Could their passion be the real thing . . . or just a vacation from reality?&lt;/p&gt;" />
