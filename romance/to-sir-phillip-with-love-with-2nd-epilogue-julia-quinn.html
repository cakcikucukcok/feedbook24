  <title>To Sir Phillip, With Love With 2nd Epilogue - Julia Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sir Phillip knew that Eloise Bridgerton was a spinster, and so he&amp;#8217;d proposed, figuring that she&amp;#8217;d be homely and unassuming, and more than a little desperate for an offer of marriage. Except . . . she wasn&amp;#8217;t. The beautiful woman on his doorstep was anything but quiet, and when she stopped talking long enough to close her mouth, all he wanted to do was kiss her . . . and more.&lt;/p&gt;Did he think she was mad? Eloise Bridgerton couldn&amp;#8217;t marry a man she had never met! But then she started thinking . . . and wondering . . . and before she knew it, she was in a hired carriage in the middle of the night, on her way to meet the man she hoped might be her perfect match. Except . . . he wasn&amp;#8217;t. Her perfect husband wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so moody and ill-mannered, and while Phillip was certainly handsome, he was a large brute of a man, rough and rugged, and totally unlike the London gentlemen vying for her hand. But when he smiled . . . and when he kissed her . . . the rest of the world simply fell away, and she couldn&amp;#8217;t help but wonder . . . could this imperfect man be perfect for her?" />
