  <title>The Firefighter&#39;s Pretend Fiancee (A Sweet Popular Romance) - Victoria James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leaving Shadow Creek nine years ago was the hardest thing Molly Mayberry&#39;s ever had to do...except maybe returning. She&#39;s never regretted her choice, but a chance of a lifetime position at the local hospital means going home and facing her past, including her shrew of an estranged mother and the fiancé she ran out on. Ben Matthews is still the sexy, sweet man she left behind...and apparently still her fiancé.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben has been doggedly pursuing the position of fire chief since he was a teenager. There&#39;s just one problem--he has to show his boss he&#39;s ready to settle down. No matter how silly the condition, Ben will make it happen. And apparently so will his brother when he opens his mouth and decides to tell everyone Ben and Molly are engaged. Now the one woman he never stopped loving is living with him in a fake relationship, driving him crazy. Pretending only reminds him how right they were once, but if Ben gives in to the heat building between them, heartache is sure to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Shadow Creek, Montana series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Christmas with the Sheriff&lt;br&gt;* The Baby Bombshell&lt;br&gt;* The Doctor&#39;s Redemption&lt;br&gt;* Baby on the Bad Boy&#39;s Doorstep&lt;br&gt;* The Firefighter&#39;s Pretend Fiance&lt;br&gt;* A Christmas Miracle for the Doctor&lt;/p&gt;" />
