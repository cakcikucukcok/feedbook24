  <title>The Devil in Denim - Melanie Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIFE JUST THREW HER A CURVEBALL.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;As the team-owner&#39;s daughter, Maggie Jameson grew up in the New York Saints&#39; stadium-glove, cap, hot dogs, and all. Baseball&#39;s in her blood, and she&#39;s always dreamed of the day when she would lead the Saints to victory herself. That was before her dad had to sell the team to Alex Winters. The fast-talking, fiercely attractive businessman has a baseball pedigree that&#39;s distinctly minor league. Maggie wants to hate him but his skills of seduction, however, are off the charts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;WILL LOVE BE A HOME RUN?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Alex could never have imagined how much this team means to Maggie. He needs her to help show the players that they&#39;re still a family...even if he and Maggie are at the verge of exchanging blows. But her fiery determination and gorgeous looks prove irresistible to Alex. And much as he wants to relegate their relationship to the playing field-and get the Saints back in the game-Alex just can&#39;t help himself: What he wants to win most is Maggie&#39;s heart...in &lt;i&gt;The Devil in Denim &lt;/i&gt;by Melanie Scott.&lt;/p&gt;" />
