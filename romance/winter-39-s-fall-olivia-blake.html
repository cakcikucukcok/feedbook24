  <title>Winter&#39;s Fall - Olivia Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Most fairy tales start with a wicked stepmother...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nicole&amp;rsquo;s life in Key West was paradise until her father died. Then her stepmother stole his dive company, fired her, and kicked her out of her apartment. To add insult to injury, Nicole&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend dumped her for her stepsister. Now she&amp;rsquo;s alone, practically broke, working in a job she hates, and living in a squalid apartment with two roommates she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wish on her worst enemy. Well, maybe on her stepsister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then she runs into bad boy billionaire Andrew Winter. Literally runs into him, because the lunatic decided to drive his Mercedes through the worst traffic snarl on the island. When she loses her bartending job&amp;mdash;thanks to her ex and her stepbrother&amp;mdash;Andrew steps in to save the day. He&amp;rsquo;ll pay her to be his tour guide while he&amp;rsquo;s vacationing in the Keys. Why not? The money is good and the company is better, but it&amp;rsquo;s the kisses that keep her coming back. There&amp;rsquo;s just one problem&amp;mdash;what&amp;rsquo;s she going to do when he leaves?" />
