  <title>His to Keep (an Out of Uniform novella) - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;School teacher Marceline Bellini gave up everything--men, sex, anything resembling a social life--to raise her young daughter. To be the perfect parent. But when she attends an engagement party in her standard stick-in-the-mud mode, her friends begin plying Marcy with shots. Just enough to convince her that a little fun doesn&#39;t sound like a bad idea... and having some naughty fun is an even better one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like finding herself deliciously pressed against a dark alley wall by the very familiar and very hot body of her best friend&#39;s older brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of waiting in painful silence, police officer Aaron Robinson finally has Marcy&#39;s attention. And man, does he have it. But nothing could have prepared either of them for the rush of fiery lust between them. So he&#39;ll just have to convince Marcy he&#39;s for real. And that a rainy, lust-fuelled romp is the first step to a lifetime of completely imperfect happiness...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Out of Uniform series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* In Bed with Mr. Wrong&lt;br&gt;* His to Keep&lt;br&gt;* Falling for His Best Friend&lt;br&gt;* His Lover to Protect&lt;br&gt;* His to Take&lt;/p&gt;" />
