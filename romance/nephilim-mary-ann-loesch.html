      <meta name="description" content="When sin stains your soul, he tattoos your skin.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Tattoo artist Nathan Ink is more than he seems. An angel living in secret on earth, he forces his clients to face their flaws by tattooing images of their sins on their bodies, but this glimpse into the soul often results in his clients&#39; deaths. Although Nathan avoids the other angels, when they ask him to keep an eye on Faye, a nephilim being stalked by another of her kind, he reluctantly agrees. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The angels have kept Faye in the dark about her stalker, but to keep her close to Nathan, they&#39;ve tasked her with investigating the high mortality rate of Nathan&#39;s clients. Despite her distaste for his methods, she finds herself fighting a growing attraction to Nathan, and discovering he&#39;s not a rogue after all forces her to question her own mission. When Faye learns her stalker is another nephilim who intends to use her to breed a new race of hellish beings, teaming up with Nathan may be the only way to prevent a genocide. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Contains strong language and violence&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;26,300 Words" />
