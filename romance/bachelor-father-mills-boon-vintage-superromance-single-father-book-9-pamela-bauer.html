            &lt;em&gt;Who is Faith?&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what Adam Novak wants to know. She looks just like his ex-lover, now missing and presumed dead–whose disappearance turned him from carefree bachelor into instant father to their six-year-old daughter, Megan. That&#39;s also what Faith wants to know. Left by the side of the road, the victim of an assault, she has no memory and no identity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether or not she is Megan&#39;s mom, Faith has won the hearts of the little girl and her father. But could there be another family out there waiting for her? And when her memory returns, will she have to leave Adam and Megan behind?&lt;/p&gt;
