          &lt;strong&gt;Four sizzlingly sexy romances from Mills &amp; Boon!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Heir the Prince Secures&lt;/em&gt; by Jennie Lucas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Seduced by a stranger…Claimed as his princess! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After an exquisite encounter with a Sicilian leaves idealistic Tess alone, penniless and pregnant, she’s raising her tiny daughter by herself. Until Stefano returns to New York, discovers his unknown heir, and reveals himself to be royalty! Suddenly, with Stefano determined to protect his daughter, Tess is days away from being bound to him permanently…as his Cinderella bride!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bound by Their Scandalous Baby&lt;/em&gt; by Heidi Rice&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s the billionaire she should resist…but he&#39;s the billionaire she’s bound to!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hotel tycoon Lukas Blackstone is shocked to learn he has an orphaned nephew – and infuriated by the electricity sizzling between him and his nephew’s guardian, Bronte! Despite their powerful attraction, Lukas knows to steer clear of Bronte – he learned the hard way that family life isn’t for him. But when the sensational fire between them ignites, the dramatic consequences will tie them together—forever…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The King&#39;s Captive Virgin&lt;/em&gt; by Natalie Anderson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A woman untouched…Awakened by her King!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kassie’s scandalous family has left her craving a life in the shadows, not the spotlight. Then King Giorgos Nicolaides kidnaps her, demanding information about his missing sister! She knows nothing – but their potent attraction unlocks a desire Kassie never thought possible. A deal is struck – she will help protect his sister’s reputation, and Giorgos will introduce Kassie to the decadent pleasure only he can arouse in her…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Ring to Take His Revenge&lt;/em&gt; by Pippa Roscoe&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He’ll do anything to settle the score……even faking an engagement!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To secure his revenge against his cruel father, billionaire Antonio Arcuri needs a fake fiancée—fast! He demands his shy PA Emma Guilham wear his diamond. In return, he’ll help fulfil her own dreams—starting with a jet-set trip to Buenos Aires! It’s a simple charade, until the burning tension between them erupts into irresistible desire. Now Antonio must decide between vengeance and Emma…&lt;/p&gt;
