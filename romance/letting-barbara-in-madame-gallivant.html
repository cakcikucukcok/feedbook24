  <title>Letting Barbara In - Madame Gallivant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Time moves on, and Destin is moving to Alabama for college. Tabitha doesn&amp;#39;t want to let him go- but despite her conflict as his mother and his lover, she knows that her son must be allowed to move forward in life. She accompanies him on his move, and ensures that he is left in the good hands of his Aunt Barbara.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
As I left the room, I heard the sounds of music coming from downstairs. They must be up, even though outside of the window I could see that it was very late at night. Well, Destin did not have school for another few weeks, and Barbara was likewise unoccupied until the commencement of the fall schedule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lights were on in the entryway, and as I looked into the parlor, I saw that Barbara and Destin were busy playing a card game of some type. Both had half emptied crystal glasses, and a bottle of whiskey sat on the end table, likewise half gone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So,&amp;rdquo; Barbara said, her genteel manner reverting to the Alabama girl she had been, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m getting bored with playing cards, Destin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;#39;t tell me you are ready for bed,&amp;rdquo; Destin said, rolling his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, I didn&amp;#39;t say that,&amp;rdquo; Barbara said, smiling as she sipped from her drink, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m just ready for something other than playing cards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ok,&amp;rdquo; Destin said, &amp;ldquo;What did you have in mind?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;rdquo; Barbara said, &amp;ldquo;What would you do on a cool southern night, with an attractive female?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo; Destin asked, unsure of what she meant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, Destin,&amp;rdquo; Barbara said, &amp;ldquo;Just forget that I am your great aunt for a moment. If I was some girl from the college, and we were alone and drinking whiskey, what would you be doing right now?&amp;rdquo;" />
