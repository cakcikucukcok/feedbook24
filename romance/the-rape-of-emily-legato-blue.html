  <title>The Rape of Emily - Legato Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Emily is raped hard by her father on her 18th birthday after he gets sick of her damn freeloading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today is my eighteenth birthday, you would think that I would be happy about that. Jumping for joy, making sure everyone knew my Amazon Wishlist, and planning my day out with the girls. I should be happy, after all, this is my day, my time to shine. For all intent and purposes, I was a woman now. Ready to face the world. To figure out my career, find a good man, have children, and live a good and peaceful life. But if life was that simple this world would be a utopia, and all signs pointed to my life being anything but sweet and wholesome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First my so-called career. I imagined myself a doctor, I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to be one. I remember watching those surgical documentary shows that used to air on tv. Fascinated by the tiny camera burrowing inside the body and the tools which seared the flesh apart. But most importantly, how thankful those people were to the doctors who saved their lives. I wanted to do that; I imagined myself as the doctor. Hell, I even joined a medical club in high school, and it was there that I realized how out of my league I truly was. Nothing is more frustrating than wanting to do something only to be too stupid to do it. So much for my chosen career. Next, my boyfriend dumped me the moment his Uni in New York accepted him, and now here I was in my room, my head hurting from the bottle of red wine I stole from my father&amp;rsquo;s cabinet last night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The savory bacon waft into the junky room of scattered clothes, shoes, and tech causing my stomach to grumble.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Emily!&amp;rdquo; My brother called from below. &amp;ldquo;Get your ass up it&amp;rsquo;s time to eat!&amp;rdquo;" />
