      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Louisiana, 1815&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Th&amp;#233;r&amp;#232;se Bondurant trusted her parents to provide for her and her young half-sister, though they never wed due to laws against mixed-race marriage. But when both die of a fever, Th&amp;#233;r&amp;#232;se learns her only inheritance is debt&amp;#8212;and her father&#39;s promise that somewhere on his plantation lies a buried treasure. To save her own life&amp;#8212;as well as that of her sister&amp;#8212;she&#39;ll need to find it before her white cousins take possession of the land.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;British officer Henry Farlow, dazed from a wound received in battle outside New Orleans, stumbles onto Th&amp;#233;r&amp;#232;se&#39;s property out of necessity. But he stays because he&#39;s become captivated by her intelligence and beauty. It&#39;s thanks to Th&amp;#233;r&amp;#232;se&#39;s tender care that he regains his strength just in time to fend off her cousin, inadvertently killing the would-be rapist in the process.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Though he risks being labeled a deserter, it&#39;s much more than a sense of duty that compels Henry to see the sisters to safety&amp;#8212;far away from the scene of the crime. And Th&amp;#233;r&amp;#232;se realizes she has come to rely on Henry for so much more than protection. On their journey to freedom in England, they must navigate a territory that&#39;s just as foreign to them both&amp;#8212;love.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;90,000 words" />
