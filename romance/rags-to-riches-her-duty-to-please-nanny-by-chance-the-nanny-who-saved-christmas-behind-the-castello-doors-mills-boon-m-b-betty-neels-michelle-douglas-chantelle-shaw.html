          &lt;strong&gt;NANNY BY CHANCE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just as Araminta Pomfrey was to begin her nurse’s training, her parents volunteered her as a nanny to Dr. Marcus van der Breugh’s twin nephews. Outraged, Araminta decided to personally inform Marcus she would not do it. But after meeting him—and learning that she could help and be a student at his hospital—she changed her mind. Perhaps nursing wasn’t really what she wanted to do…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE NANNY WHO SAVED CHRISTMAS&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This Christmas, Nicola McGillroy will:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1. Be a great nanny to Cade Hindmarsh’s two adorable little girls, and give them the best Christmas they&#39;ve had since their mother left.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2. Enter into the Christmas spirit and forget the fact she should have been planning her own wedding right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;3. Keep a straight head in her attraction to her gorgeous off-limits boss… Surely this is just a rebound thing and not true love—for both of them?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;BEHIND THE CASTELLO DOORS&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cesario Piras, brooding master of the Castello del Falco wasn’t prepared for the visitor that turned up on his doorstep during a raging storm – or with a little bundle bearing the Piras name she has in tow. Cesario’s head screamed run, but his damaged heart began to betray him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beth Granger knew that the moment she knocked on the castle door that there was no going back. She had a job to do, but the moment Cesario looked deep into her pleading eyes her faultless plan crumbled around her…&lt;/p&gt;
