        &lt;p&gt;She was supposed to be home in Montana for Thanksgiving, but Kristin McKaslin was stranded at the Boise airport–in a snowstorm. There was no hope. Then, out of nowhere, a car pulled up. It was Ryan Sanders, the charming football player she&#39;d barely known in high school. He was going home, too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kristin&#39;s girl-next-door beauty had always stayed with Ryan, and she&#39;d turned into an incredible woman. But he thought he loved another. So what was that hard knot doing in his gut when their all-night drive was over? Why didn&#39;t he want to see her go?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly Ryan suspected the Lord might have more in mind than just a drive….&lt;/p&gt;
