        &lt;p&gt;CAN LOVE CONQUER ALL?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Devastated by the discovery of a terrible family secret, Patrick Devaney put a No Trespassing sign on his battered heart and shut out the world. Then Alice Newberry, who had her own wounds to heal, burst into his life and coaxed him out of hiding with her red-hot kisses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alice&#39;s soft brown eyes saw right through Patrick&#39;s defenses to the sorrow he&#39;d tried to bury. The enchanting kindergarten teacher taught him a powerful lesson about love and forgiveness, and encouraged him to hope again. But before he could truly claim Alice as his own, Patrick had to face the greatest challenge of his life–his past.&lt;/p&gt;
