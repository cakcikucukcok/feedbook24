  <title>What Happens in London - Julia Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rumors and Gossip . . . The lifeblood of London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Olivia Bevelstoke is told that her new neighbor may have killed his fianc&amp;#233;e, she doesn&#39;t believe it for a second, but, still, how can she help spying on him, just to be sure? So she stakes out a spot near her bedroom window, cleverly concealed by curtains, watches, and waits . . . and discovers a most intriguing man, who is definitely up to something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Harry Valentine works for the boring branch of the War Office, translating documents vital to national security. He&#39;s not a spy, but he&#39;s had all the training, and when a gorgeous blonde begins to watch him from her window, he is instantly suspicious. But just when he decides that she&#39;s nothing more than an annoyingly nosy debutante, he discovers that she might be engaged to a foreign prince, who might be plotting against England. And when Harry is roped into spying on Olivia, he discovers that he might be falling for her himself . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
