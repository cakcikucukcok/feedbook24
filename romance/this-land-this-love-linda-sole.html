  <title>This Land This Love - Linda Sole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Aden Sawle cares for only two things in life: his land and lovely Rebecca Cottrel, the only daughter of a wealthy publican. But Rebecca has been educated above her station and her dreams are all of Sir Victor Roth, her best friend&#39;s handsome husband--an impoverished farmer is no match for her, despite her unwilling attraction. So Aden distracts himself with another girl, until tragedy leaves Rebecca orphaned and alone in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing her own vulnerability, Rebecca takes refuge in marriage with Aden and, despite such unpromising beginnings, the match looks like a happy one. Through hard work and shrewd business deals Aden amasses a fortune and at last is able to offer his darling the position in society she deserves, as the lady of the wealthiest landowner in the district. But when a band of gypsies comes to work in Aden&#39;s fields, they bring with them a reminder of his final fling with a local girl, a reminder that threatens the life he and Rebecca have made together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Rebecca is about to discover the first of many secrets the man she has come to love has kept from her, in Linda Sole&#39;s &lt;i&gt;This Land This Love&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
