  <title>Fatal Fallout (Mills &amp; Boon Romantic Suspense) - Lara Lacombe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Torn between duty and desire, two strangers must risk all for love&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nuclear physicist Dr. Claire Fleming has one rule: never get close to anyone. But when her colleague is murdered and she&#39;s targeted next, she must place all her trust in FBI agent Thomas Kincannon. Soon Claire forgets her tenet as she fantasizes about Thomas&#39;s touch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thomas is wildly attracted to Claire. But his life and his job are too complicated for any romantic entanglements. Despite this, they share a mind-blowing kiss, and there&#39;s no turning back. When Thomas&#39;s niece is abducted, the stakes become dangerously higher as Claire insists he trade her for the child. Somehow, Thomas must find a way to rescue his family and protect the woman who let her protective walls down just for him.&lt;/p&gt;
