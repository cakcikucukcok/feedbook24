  <title>Good Girls Don&#39;t Date Rock Stars - Codi Gary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gemma Carlson didn&amp;#39;t plan on waking up married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also didn&amp;#39;t count on running into her old flame&amp;#8212;and her son&amp;#39;s father-turned-country rock star&amp;#8212;Travis Bowers, followed by a night of drunken dares. Apparently one of those involved a ring on her finger and a vow &amp;#8230; neither of which she intends to keep. Now with a hangover from hell, this good-girl-gone-bad knows there&amp;#39;s just one thing to do: run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis has been all over the world, but Gemma has never been far from his thoughts. So when they had the chance to catch up over a few drinks, he didn&amp;#39;t hesitate. Of course, he didn&amp;#39;t expect it would lead to marriage, or a runaway bride! Travis finally has a second chance and doesn&amp;#39;t plan on losing Gemma again&amp;#8212;or the son he didn&amp;#39;t know he had. He proposes, albeit belatedly, a date. Or rather, a few. If they can make this marriage work by starting over, he stays. If not &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemma&amp;#39;s not interested; she&amp;#39;s got a son to protect and a heart to heal. But having Travis around &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make both a little easier. Still, good girls don&amp;#39;t date rock stars . . . right?&lt;/p&gt;" />
