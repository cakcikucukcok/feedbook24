      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By the king&#39;s command, Sir Richard Blythe has reluctantly agreed to wed&amp;#8212;for that is the only way to regain his birthright. But he never expected to be smitten by the lovely bride who has been forced upon him. To own the heart and soul of Elissa Longbourne, Sir Richard would be willing to forsake all other women; yet he realizes that it will take more than a marriage vow to free the passion he sees simmering in the stubborn beauty&#39;s eyes. So the notorious nobleman sets out to tame his willful wife&amp;#8212;one slow, luxurious kiss at a time...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elissa refuses to love her bridegroom, even though he is so maddeningly handsome that he had stolen her breath away upon her very first glance. Richard Blythe is a husband to be feared. Now he holds the key to Elissa&#39;s young son&#39;s legacy in his powerful hands. Dare a pretty widow trust a rogue such as he with her heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
