  <title>Playing It Cool - Amy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Score one for the curvy girls.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Nugent might have a little extra junk in her trunk, but her stepbrother calling her out on it is the last straw... When rugby hottie, Dexter Blake, witnesses the insult, he surprises Harper by asking her out. In front of her dumbass brother. Score! Of course, she knows it&#39;s not for reals, but Dex won&#39;t take no for an answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dexter Blake&#39;s life revolves around rugby with one hard and fast rule: no women. Sure, his left hand is getting a workout, but he&#39;s focused on his career for now. Then he overhears an asshat reporter belittle the curvy chick he&#39;d been secretly ogling. What&#39;s a guy to do but ask her out? It&#39;s just a little revenge against a poser, and then he&#39;ll get his head back in the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the date is better than either expected. So is the next one. And the next. And the heat between them...sizzles their clothes right off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, this fake relationship is feeling all too real...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Sydney Smoke Rugby series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Playing By Her Rules&lt;br&gt;* Playing It Cool&lt;br&gt;* Playing the Player&lt;br&gt;* Playing With Forever&lt;br&gt;* Playing House&lt;br&gt;* Playing Dirty&lt;/p&gt;" />
