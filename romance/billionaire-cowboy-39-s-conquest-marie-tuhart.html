  <title>Billionaire Cowboy&#39;s Conquest - Marie Tuhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sidelined from his rodeo career by an injury, billionaire Texas rancher Hunter Knight returns to home to find the staff overworked and the office a mess. He hates paperwork, so he&amp;#39;s pleased to hear his sister has hired an office manager. But when he finds out it&amp;#39;s Jessica Sinclair, his sister&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;party-girl best friend from college, he&amp;#39;s not happy and wants her fired. Even worse than her partying past, he&amp;#39;s attracted to her.&amp;nbsp;Burned once by his gold-digging, city woman of an ex-wife, he has no interest in playing with fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogged by&amp;nbsp;a past that won&amp;rsquo;t let her go, Jessica arrives&amp;nbsp;at the ranch&amp;nbsp;with a plan: excel as an office manager, stay away from the bulls, and no cowboys. Her father died when thrown from a bull when she was a kid, so avoiding them is key.&amp;nbsp;Cowboys, well, they&amp;#39;re just as dangerous as the bulls. Then there&amp;#39;s Hunter Knight, part owner of the Double K ranch. This stubborn cowboy can ruin everything by sending her away before she can earn a single penny. Buying time with a proposal solves one problem but leads her straight into riskier territory, fighting an attraction to the bull-riding billionaire boss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can this city girl and cowboy survive the wildest ride of their lives?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
