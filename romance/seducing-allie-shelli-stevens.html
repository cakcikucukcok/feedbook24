  <title>Seducing Allie - Shelli Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Allison Siegel is out to stop a wedding, or at least stage an intervention to convince one of her best childhood friends not to marry the woman she&#39;s sure is all wrong for him. The only problem is they have a mutual friend who doesn&#39;t want her to butt in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clint&#39;s loved Allie since she grew out of pigtails, but she never saw him as more than a friend. Even though she doesn&#39;t know it yet, he&#39;s being a really good friend by stopping her from getting all &quot;My Best-Friend&#39;s Wedding&quot;. And he&#39;s ready and able to convince her to let the sparks now between them build into a fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie can&#39;t believe how good Clint looks all grown up, and she certainly can&#39;t believe he&#39;s holding her captive in the backwoods of Montana until he thinks she&#39;s come to her senses, or their friend&#39;s wedding goes off without a hitch.. But Allie isn&#39;t going to let a little thing like a six-foot-something sexy forest ranger stand in her way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Seattle Steam series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Grounds for Seduction     &lt;br&gt;* Tempting Adam     &lt;br&gt;* Seducing Allie&lt;/p&gt;" />
