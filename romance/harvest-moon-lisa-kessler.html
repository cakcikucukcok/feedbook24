      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Ayers unleashes all of his rage and his frustration through fists and brute force in an underground boxing ring. The werewolf may be the pack&#39;s doctor, but he can&#39;t even heal his coma-stricken father after the Nero Organization&#39;s attack stopped his heart. And as his Pack brothers settle down around him, he still refuses to believe in the fairy tale notion that every wolf has a true mate...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hiding and on the run, nurse Kilani Akamu is a loose end that Nero is desperate to tie up. She can&#39;t afford to be attracted to a doctor-especially one as unexpectedly hot and complex as Jason. Yet the sexual sparks arcing between them are undeniable...and Kilani&#39;s precognitive senses warn her that temptation is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All it takes is one touch to send Jason&#39;s wolf howling. But even if he could protect her from Nero, he can&#39;t protect her from himself...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Moon series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Moonlight&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Hunter&#39;s Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Blood Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Harvest Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #5 Ice Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #6 Blue Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #7 Wolf Moon&lt;br&gt;Book #8 New Moon&lt;/p&gt;" />
