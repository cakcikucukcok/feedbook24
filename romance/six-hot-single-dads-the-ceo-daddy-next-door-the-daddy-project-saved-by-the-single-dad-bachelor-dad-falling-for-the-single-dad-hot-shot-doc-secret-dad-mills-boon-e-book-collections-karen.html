        &lt;h2&gt;Six Hot Single Dads&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Six gorgeous, sexy men with a caring, tender side…&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;How can any woman resist this chance at her happily ever after?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CEO DADDY NEXT DOOR by Karen Booth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcus is a reserved CEO with a baby daughter and thinks his free-spirited neighbour is completely unsuitable. So why can’t he keep her out of his bed…and out of his heart?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE DADDY PROJECT by Lee McKenzie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distractingly sexy Nate is raising his twin little girls alone, and he has had enough matchmaking from his family. So single mum Kristi and he stage a fake relationship…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVED BY THE SINGLE DAD by Annie Claydon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cass tells herself that she’s not falling for the gorgeous paramedic single dad she rescued near the river. She’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; thinking about what his skin would feel like under her hands as she patches him up!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACHELOR DAD by Roxann Delaney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;City lawyer Garrett Miles is a happy man who enjoys his moments with gorgeous waitress Libby. Then he finds out he’s a father, and that his little girl is coming to live with him…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FALLING FOR THE SINGLE DAD by Emilie Forbes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight she could have what her heart desired. And she desired him… But exceedingly hot or not, Damien’s a complication. Especially since he’s a single dad, her boss and neighbour…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOT-SHOT DOC, SECRET DAD by Lynne Marshall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn’t go for sexy or overpowering or anything beyond a sweet meeting of their lips for old times’ sake. Trevor still remembers Julie from that summer night all those years ago…&lt;/p&gt;
