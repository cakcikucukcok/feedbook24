  <title>Blackberry&#39;s Wine - Michele Jackson Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dory wanted to love again, but didnt see it happening any time soon. Besides (she thought), who would want a middle-aged divorcee with deep-rooted trust issues? Then one night, a silent prayer at a local gospel concert turned her world upside down. Can she, by faith, overcome her fears, insecurity, jealousy, anger, temptation, and the haunting secrets of her past in order to allow herself to experience the purity of a sweet encounter with an unlikely suitor? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then theres Markyoung, gentle, passionate; full of life, love and the Holy Spirit. Emotionally numbed from being hurt by a previous love-gone-wrong relationship, commitment is a foreign word in his vocabulary. Yet, theres a gnawing void in his heart that&#39;s longing to be filled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a head-strong, independent woman and a spontaneous, free-spirited man find love in each other and together start a brand new life? Will their spiritual convictions and Christian values be the strength of their relationship, or will their personal hang-ups be its derailment? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackberry&#39;s Wine is an edgy inspirational romance novel filled with relationship issues, prayer, encouragement, honesty, hope, faith and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
