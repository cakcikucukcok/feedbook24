  <title>Touch of Desire - Susan Spencer Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Dearest Reader,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For as long as I can remember, my life has been a solitary one. Do not think me a pitiable recluse, for, as the Earl of Graymar, I have taken my place in Society when I must, and enjoyed both the company and pleasure of desirable lovers. But as the Great Sorcerer, or Dewin Mawr, as magic mortals call me, I have always believed that my destiny and the duty I owe to all those who possess unique powers, has precluded love, marriage, and true companionship. I was resigned to my lonely fate. Until now...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarah Tamony is unlike any mere mortal woman I have ever known. Passionate and bold, she has heard the whispers about my people and discovered that I belong to an ancient Welsh clan descended from magic. Yet the dark secrets of magic mortals seem to hold no terror for her--instead she asks to know more, even seeks to reveal the truth in the popular tales she spins. This I cannot allow. For centuries, my kind has striven to maintain our privacy, fearful of what might happen if our powers should be exposed to the world. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarah has learned a great deal about magic, but there is still much she does not know, and dangers she cannot fathom...dangers that grow closer every day. Her lightest touch ignites a deep hunger in me, and her love is a prize I would risk my life to own...for she has already stolen my soul...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your obedient servant,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Malachi &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seymour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, Castle Glain Tarran, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wales&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
