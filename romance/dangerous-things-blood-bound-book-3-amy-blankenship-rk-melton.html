Everyone says there are two paths in life, but for Jewel Scott it looked like both of them were very dangerous. One led toward Anthony, a murdering psychopathic Werewolf who was also the head of the city mob and her fianc&amp;eacute;&amp;hellip; against her will. The other road led toward Steven, a Werecougar whom she had knocked out with a baseball bat on their first meeting. He retaliated by kidnapping her and making her his mate.&lt;br /&gt;

Anthony Valachi had become obsessed with Jewel when she was no more than a child and, under mob rule, he&amp;rsquo;d gained control of his bride to be. If anyone thought they could steal her away from him they were wrong&amp;hellip; dead wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
