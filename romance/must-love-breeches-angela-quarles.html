  <title>Must Love Breeches - Angela Quarles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She&#39;s finally met the man of her dreams–too bad he lives in a different century!
 
A devoted history buff finds the re-enactment of a pre-Victorian ball in London a bit boring…until a mysterious artifact sweeps her back in time to the real event, and into the arms of a compelling British lord.
 
Isabelle Rochon can&#39;t believe it when she finds herself in the reality of 1830&#39;s London high society. She&#39;s thrilled to witness events and people she&#39;s studied. But she may also have to survive without modern tools or career–unless she can find a way to return to her time. And then there&#39;s Viscount Lord Montagu, a man whose embrace curls her toes, but who has a dangerous agenda of his own.
 
Lord Phineas Montagu is on a mission to avenge his sister, and he&#39;ll stop at nothing, including convincing an alluring stranger to pose as his respectable fiancé. He&#39;s happy to repay her by helping her search for her stolen calling card case that brought her back in time. But he doesn’t bargain for the lady being his intellectual match–or for the irresistible attraction that flames between them.
 
They&#39;re both certain they know what they want, but as passion flares, Phineas must keep both himself and Isabella safe from unseen opponents, and she must choose when and where her heart belongs. Can they ever be together for good?
 
Don&#39;t miss the time travel romance USA Today called &quot;a delicious twist on historical drama and romance.&quot;
