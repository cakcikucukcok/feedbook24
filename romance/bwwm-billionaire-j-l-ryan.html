  <title>BWWM Billionaire - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Curvy girl Sierra&amp;nbsp;Ford regrets that she agreed to impersonate her friend on a blind date. The only guys she&amp;#39;s ever met on blind dates were unemployed leeches living in their parents&amp;#39; basements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The minute she arrives at the restaurant to meet her mystery man, she wants to leave, but knows her friend will kill her if she does.&amp;nbsp;When she sees her date for the first time, she almost passes out. She recognizes him as billionaire A.J. Trager. Why would he need to find a girlfriend on a blind date? Beautiful women throw themselves at him 24 hours a day. He can have anyone he wants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As their date progresses, Sierra and A.J. seem to be hitting it off, but he almost seems too interested in her. Is he really attracted to this plus-size &amp;quot;plain Jane,&amp;quot; or is he hiding a scandalous secret from his past that could rock her to the core?&lt;br /&gt;
