  <title>Let It Be Me - Jody Holford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Megan Carter&#39;s spent the past five years nannying for a pint-size boss--the adorable Charlie--while also navigating her full-size boss, his somewhat grouchy, way-too-methodical dad, Adam. Now that she&#39;s finally moving on, helping Adam find her replacement should be easy...except he doesn&#39;t want another nanny. He wants a wife. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam&#39;s been burned by love in the past, so of course he believes finding someone who can be a partner in raising his son is all that matters. Too bad the woman helping him search is the biggest believer in love at first sight and happily-ever-after he&#39;s ever met.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as Adam&#39;s funny, charming, and--who would have thought it?--super-hot side starts to come out, Megan knows that without love, a family would never be complete. But convincing Adam of that might be harder than she thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Love Unexpected series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Let It Be Me&lt;br&gt;* Never Expected You&lt;br&gt;* Story of Us&lt;/p&gt;" />
