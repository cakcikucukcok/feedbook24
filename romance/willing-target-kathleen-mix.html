  <title>Willing Target - Kathleen Mix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last thing covert operative Mitch Weaver wants right now is to be partnered with a reckless newbie, even if she is gorgeous. Still reeling from the death of his former partner, Mitch doesn&#39;t need the responsibility of keeping anyone else alive - a task made even harder when they volunteer to be a killer&#39;s target. She&#39;s too perky for her own good and too distracting by far-that could get them both killed in this line of work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea Carnegie&#39;s first assignment isn&#39;t exactly going as she planned. Her partner is sexy as hell, but he&#39;s so frustrating with his determination to keep her away from anything he deems dangerous. How is she supposed to do her job? Andrea knows that masquerading as a billionaire&#39;s sister to bait a possible killer is her chance to shine. But if she&#39;s going to succeed, she&#39;ll have to find a way to work with Mitch... and keep her distance. Even as the very air between them seems to sizzle, Andrea knows the worst possible thing she could do is fall for her partner.&lt;/p&gt;" />
