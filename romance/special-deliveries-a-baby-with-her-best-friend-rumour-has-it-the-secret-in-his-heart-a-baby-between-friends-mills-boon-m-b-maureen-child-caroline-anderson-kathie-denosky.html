  <title>Special Deliveries: A Baby With Her Best Friend: Rumour Has It / The Secret in His Heart / A Baby Between Friends (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Maureen Child, Caroline Anderson, Kathie DeNosky</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Rumour Has It&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Something to Hide?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, wealthy sheriff Nathan Battle proposed to his pregnant girlfriend. But Amanda Altman ripped out his heart, left town – and suffered a miscarriage. Now she&#39;s back and Nathan has to get over her once and for all. But his plan to seduce her, say goodbye forever and focus on his job isn&#39;t working too well.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Upon returning to gossipy Royal, Texas, Amanda&#39;s determined not to show Nathan how much she still loves him. Yet resisting the gorgeous lawman is impossible. Especially when she discovers she&#39;s pregnant with his child…again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Secret in His Heart&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He had promised to look after her…now he wants so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Promise me you&#39;ll take care of her.&quot; Simple as that. Except for Dr. James Slater, fulfilling his vow to look after his best friend&#39;s wife after he died in Afghanistan has never been simple. Especially now that lovely, vital Connie has asked him to help her have a baby. He can&#39;t just father her child and then walk away – he wants and loves her too much for that. Only, how can he even begin to tell her…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Baby Between Friends&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What Are Best Friends For?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More than anything, Summer Patterson wants a baby. What she doesn&#39;t want is a husband. Thankfully, her best friend, Ryder McClain, makes the perfect sperm donor. Ryder is loyal, undeniably sexy and the one man she trusts – the only reason she agrees to conceive their baby naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When baby-making nights with Summer blaze like the West Texas sun, Ryder feels the heat. He never expected Summer to say yes to sharing his bed. Now he&#39;s falling for her – and the prospect of fatherhood – while hiding a secret that could destroy her faith in him forever.&lt;/p&gt;
