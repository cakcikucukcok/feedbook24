  <title>Madness at Midnight - Sylvia A. Witmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Criminals usually commit their crimes which generate madness around  midnight while innocent people are fast asleep in their beds.  It was almost midnight when Erin Andrews witnessed a drug exchange between two boats at Folly Beach near Charleston, S.C.  Also that same night Erin was caught spying on two Coast Guard officers as they filmed the actual drug exchange before arresting the crooks involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was almost midnight when Jess Reynolds was eyewitness to a brutal murder near the Folly Beach harbor; it was almost midnight when a beautiful blond disappears on a cruise ship never to be seen alive again.  It was a little after midnight when two bodies washed up on shore believed to be those belonging to two of the missing drug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Erin, Jess and Captain Logan Maxwell are thrown together as they try to find the missing girl and end the crime-ridden spree of a cruel  murder before any more innocent bystanders are killed.  Erin and Logan&#39;s growing passion for each other ignites the wrath of a ruthless killer and Erin&#39;s generaous nature leads her into deadly peril.
Can this case be solved before another murder is committed and can true love survive when danger lurks from every corner?&lt;/p&gt;" />
