  <title>Her Final Fling (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Joanne Rock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The last thing Christine Chandler expects when she takes this job is to be distracted by jet-setting Vito Cesare. She should be focused on the landscaping that could make her company a success.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, her gaze constantly strays to Vito&#39;s hot bod. And by the sizzling looks he sends her way, he&#39;s thinking the exact same thing. Can she give in to this particular temptation and walk away unscathed?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Spending time with Christine is doing crazy things to Vito&#39;s libido. Yet every time he makes a seductive move, she slips away… until he proposes a fling. No hassle, no strings, just a lot of adult fun. But after just a few steamy kisses, he&#39;s breaking those rules and feeling much more than heat for her. Looks as if he has to convince her that this will be her final fling!&lt;/p&gt;
