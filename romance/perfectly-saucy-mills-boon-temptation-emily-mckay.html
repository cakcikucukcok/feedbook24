        &lt;p&gt;at least not since high school. But that&#39;s about to change. This good girl has decided to go after what she&#39;s always wanted– Alex Moreno, the town&#39;s baddest bad boy, and her secret high school crush. Only, this time there will be nothing &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt; about it.…&lt;/p&gt;

Not that he minds… After all, he&#39;s always had it bad for Jessica. But a no-strings affair could ruin their reputations. Still, he knows he can&#39;t resist her sensual attacks for long. Something&#39;s got to give. And he has a feeling it&#39;ll be his willpower.…&lt;/p&gt;
