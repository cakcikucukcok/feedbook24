  <title>Breaking Brodix - Anne Rainey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brodix Jennings&#39;s skills are put to the test when his brothers call on him to help bring the dying family restaurant back into the black. With the grand re-opening only days away, it&#39;ll damn near take a miracle to keep the doors from closing for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Town reporter Sarah Greer has exactly what Brodix needs, free publicity on the front page of the town&#39;s only newspaper. All she wants in return is a chance to interview the Jennings brothers, all five of them. The newspaper&#39;s readership would eat up a rags-to-riches story like theirs. But none of the brothers are talking, and Brodix is the worst of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brodix is immediately captivated to the buttoned-up woman with the prissy attitude. If it wasn&#39;t for her lousy profession, he&#39;d be doing everything in his power to get her out of her neatly pressed suit and into his bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each novella in the Blackwater Series is a standalone story and can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Sam&#39;s Promise&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Vance&#39;s Rules&lt;br&gt;Book 3: Breaking Brodix&lt;br&gt;Book 4: Reilly&#39;s Wildcard&lt;br&gt;Book 5: River&#39;s Redemption&lt;/p&gt;" />
