  <title>Truly, Madly, Sweetly - Kira Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An inherited parking spot. That&#39;s all it took to make Natalie Moran&#39;s food truck dreams come true. But her dream space is attached to a bakery inherited by someone &lt;i&gt;else&lt;/i&gt;--drop dead gorgeous Eric Schneider, a financial consultant who wouldn&#39;t know a cupcake from a cannoli. And he wants to buy Nat out, no matter what she has to say about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric&#39;s determined to build his own business, but he needs the super cute klutz with the cupcake truck to help. If Nat will teach him the basics of running a bakery, he&#39;ll give her free kitchen time. Except...neither expects the heat burning between them or the possibility that their arrangement might become &lt;i&gt;permanent&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it all blows up, Nat is convinced his actions mean betrayal. It&#39;s up to Eric to regain her trust and show her he&#39;s a man who is truly, madly in love with her, before she disappears from his life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Sweet Love series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Truly, Madly, Sweetly&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Totally, Sweetly, Irrevocably&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Sweetly, Deeply, Absolutely&lt;/p&gt;" />
