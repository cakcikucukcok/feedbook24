  <title>Celestial Sin - Bianca Swan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;:DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Essie McBane set her standards high and waited for true love. She never expected the answer to her prayers to fall from heaven into her chicken yard, a warrior angel with chestnut curls and a celestial body. Essie is tempted but resists leading him astray. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be responsible for his Fall. Cam-ael is wounded in the Second War in Heaven plummets into the arms of a beautiful woman. He knows he must return eventually to the war, but...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;:EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Reluctantly, Cam dipped his wings in the pond. Cold but not uncomfortable. Clean. He&amp;rsquo;d promised not to read her mind, but she was broadcasting on such a strong frequency he couldn&amp;rsquo;t help hearing her thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, big boy, strut out naked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He gave Essie her wish, emerging from the water fully erect. He didn&amp;rsquo;t try to hide anything as water and cold glazed his skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She inhaled slowly, her lips parted. Her expression robbed him of breath. The phenomenon of unintentionally hearing her thoughts must occur in intense situations&amp;mdash;and they were both emotionally and physically charged. Cam felt like he was ionized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Essie appeared to be having difficulty peeling her gaze off his engorged cock and looking into his eyes. &amp;ldquo;I thought angels were supposed to be androgynous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; His grin tasted wicked, and he could almost feel his eyes sparkling with mischief. &amp;ldquo;We come fully equipped.&amp;rdquo; He shook the hair back from his face. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the hell of it. I&amp;rsquo;m not supposed to use it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Essie&amp;rsquo;s smile faded. &amp;ldquo;That sank the ship of my fantasies.&amp;rdquo; She shrugged. &amp;ldquo;But that&amp;rsquo;s what I thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She seemed to have been talking to herself, suddenly realized what she&amp;rsquo;d said and blushed bright crimson.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He patted her arm. &amp;ldquo;Thank you for the compliment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t mention it.&amp;rdquo; Her blush darkened." />
