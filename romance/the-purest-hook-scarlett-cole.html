  <title>The Purest Hook - Scarlett Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a love built on secrets survive?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rugged and hot, heavy metal rockstar, Dred Zander is exactly the type of man that normally sends Pixie running. Not dreaming about running her hands down his washboard abs...and lower. The lead singer and guitarist for the band Preload embodies trouble behind his quick smile and guarded eyes, and Pixie left trouble behind her years ago along with the name Sarah Jane Travers and the pathetic trailer her mom called home. With her abusive past in her past, she has a new life, a new family at Second Circle Tattoos, and a dream of opening her own business. She needs capital and time. What she doesn&#39;t need is a tempting long-haired rocker or the paparazzi that follow him around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dred has other ideas. Pixie&#39;s sweet hazel eyes, purple hair and kaleidoscopic tattoo of exotic flowers that swirl up her arm haunt his dreams, and he knows she wants him too. He just has to convince her. But as a juicy exposé threatens to expose their pasts, and a blackmailer terrorizes their present, Pixie and Dred have to decide what really matters and fight like hell to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fall in love with &lt;/i&gt;The Purest Hook&lt;i&gt;, a sexy, emotional, thrilling full-length rockstar tattoo romance from Scarlett Cole, the third book in her Second Circle Tattoos series that follows new couple Dred and Pixie, and don&#39;t miss the rest of the band Preload with&lt;/i&gt; Jordan Reclaimed, Elliott Redeemed, Nikan Recovered, &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;Lennon Reborn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
