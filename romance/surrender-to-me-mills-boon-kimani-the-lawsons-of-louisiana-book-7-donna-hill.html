  <title>Surrender To Me (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Lawsons of Louisiana, Book 7) - Donna Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;No woman has ever caught him. . . until now&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rafe Lawson is driven by two things: His music and living a life away from the influence of his powerful senator father. The woman he meets at a high-profile family celebration won’t change his playboy ways. Still, Rafe is intrigued with the stunning Secret Service agent who never mixes business and pleasure. He has no choice but to jet to DC and use his legendary Lawson power of seduction to win over Avery Richards.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first female in her family to rise up the ranks of high-level government security, Avery is comfortable flying halfway across the world at a moment’s notice. But her desire for the sax-playing heir to a political dynasty creates more tension than being on presidential detail. Their fathers are enemies who share a long, bitter history, but when Avery falls for Rafe her loyalty to her family is tested and Rafe&#39;s contentious feud with his father could cost them everything. They must now decide what&#39;s most important–the life they&#39;ve always lived or the one they can possibly make together.&lt;/p&gt;
