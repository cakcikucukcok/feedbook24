  <title>Protector for Hire - Tawna Fenske</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Haunted by his time in Iraq, former soldier Schwartz Patton goes off the grid, retreating deep into Montana&#39;s untamed wilderness. Now, ten years into his self-imposed solitude, his brother tracks him down and asks for a favor. A woman is in danger, and she needs help...and Schwartz is the only one who can protect her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Designer-loving city girls like Janelle Keebler don&#39;t belong in the wilderness. Unless, of course, they&#39;re witnesses to a murder by their psycho drug-trafficking ex-husbands. Still, Janelle can&#39;t help the immediate physical response she has to her sexy-as-sin protector that leaves her wanting more than she could have ever imagined. Even if he &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; make terrible coffee...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every word, every touch, every kiss ignites a need Schwartz thought he&#39;d lost forever. He can&#39;t stop the desperate attraction simmering between him and Janelle, even if he wanted to. Even if it means it could get them &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Front and Center series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Marine for Hire&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Fiancee for Hire&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Best Man for Hire&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Protector for Hire&lt;/p&gt;" />
