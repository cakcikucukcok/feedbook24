  <title>The Wicked Billionaire - Jackie Ashenden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This high-concept series brings together the glamour of Park Avenue and hot Navy SEALs in dark, smoldering contemporary romances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tate Brothers were once orphans and they have been raised to do one thing only: protect what is theirs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a trained sniper and Navy SEAL, Lucas Tate found the courage to distance himself from the wealthy, wicked patriarch who adopted him. Instead, he&#39;s devoted his life to the elite band of brothers from his unit. So when the widow of one of his former comrades finds herself in apparent danger, Lucas makes it his job to protect her against all enemies. . .and not let her out of his sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Grace Riley feels overwhelmed by Lucas&#39;s presence, but the cold-eyed marksman will do anything to keep her safe. Soon the special attention he pays her becomes a wild romantic distraction--one that troubles Grace, since Lucas was so close to her deceased husband. Still, how can she resist Lucas&#39;s intense, ice-blue stare? All she knows is that a life without strong, passionate Lucas is one not worth living. Can Lucas can find a way to honor his former brother-in-arms by saving Grace. . .and loving her, too?&lt;/p&gt;" />
