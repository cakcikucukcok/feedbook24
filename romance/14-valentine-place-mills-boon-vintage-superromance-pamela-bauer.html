  <title>14 Valentine Place (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Pamela Bauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things change.&lt;/em&gt; Coming home isn&#39;t easy for Dylan Donovan. He left thirteen years ago, carrying a terrible secret about his father, and he can&#39;t believe what&#39;s happened since.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His widowed mother is now a savvy entrepreneur, his family home has been turned into student housing and his brothers seem to think his well-meant advice is just bossy interference. And then there&#39;s Maddie Lamont–Dylan doesn&#39;t know what to think about her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People change.&lt;/em&gt; Maddie&#39;s grown up a lot since the summer she spent with the Donovans. The braces, thick glasses and boyish figure have all been replaced, and Dylan&#39;s man enough to appreciate the transformation. What he &lt;em&gt;doesn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; appreciate is the influence Maddie seems to have on his family–particularly his mother. But like it or not, he has to get along with Maddie and remember that change &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good. At least, that&#39;s what he keeps telling himself….&lt;/p&gt;
