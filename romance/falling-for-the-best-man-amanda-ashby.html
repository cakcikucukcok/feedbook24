Most of the time­­--except the one crazy night she threw caution to the wind and slept with a sexy stranger. Totally not like her, but so worth it. And hey, who&#39;ll ever find out. It&#39;ll be her little secret...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Globe-trotting travel writer Christopher Henderson can&#39;t get one woman out of his head. He knows Emmy is all wrong for him-he&#39;d have to pry her cold dead hands from this crazy town-but living without her is slowly not becoming an option. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christopher has a game plan: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Dazzle her with his awesome cooking skills to throw her off guard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Win the world&#39;s weirdest golf trophy.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Impress her with his ability to talk cranky French dove breeders into doing his bidding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Emmy isn&#39;t playing by the rules, and Chris might have finally met his match...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Sisters of Wishing Bridge series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1: Falling for the Best Man&lt;br&gt;Book #2: The Wedding Planner&#39;s Baby&lt;br&gt;Book #3: Dating the Wrong Mr. Right&lt;/p&gt;" />
