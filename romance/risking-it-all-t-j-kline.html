  <title>Risking It All - T. J. Kline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Andrew McQuaid wasn&amp;#8217;t always the local playboy. Once upon a time, he wanted to spend the rest of his life with one woman-Gia Mancuso. When he made a mistake and lost her, he decided he wasn&amp;#8217;t meant to have a happy-ever-after. Now, Gia&amp;#8217;s come back to town, with a baby in tow, and it might just mean a second chance at forever, if he can convince her that he never stopped loving her.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years after leaving, Gia finds herself back in Hidden Falls. Between helping her ailing father save the family restaurant and taking care of the baby her sister left on her doorstep, she doesn&amp;#8217;t have time for the man who once broke her heart. But Andrew is all grown-up now, in every single way. And the part of her that has always been his can&amp;#8217;t quite say no to his tempting kisses.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;Just when Gia begins to open her heart, a devastating secret emerges that threatens to destroy her family and any future with Andrew. Are they doomed to repeat the mistakes of their past or can Andrew convince Gia that she&amp;#8217;s always been his one and only?" />
