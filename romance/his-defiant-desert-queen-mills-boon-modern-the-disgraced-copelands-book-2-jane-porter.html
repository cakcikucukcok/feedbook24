          &lt;strong&gt;I will not marry you. I will not!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Sheikh Mikael catches notorious model Jemma Copeland flaunting Saidia’s laws – &lt;em&gt;and her body&lt;/em&gt; – in his desert, he knows one thing. Revenge against his family’s destruction is within his reach! To achieve it he makes Jemma an offer: imprisonment or marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her life shattered by the scandal that rocked her family, Jemma &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; that modelling job. She didn’t know that she was breaking the law! But Mikael’s outrageous proposal pushes her beyond shock… to utter fury. If he expects her to be a meek, pliable bride, this arrogant Sheikh has another thing coming!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Jane Porter’s The Disgraced Copelands Duet:&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A family in the headlines – for all the wrong reasons!&lt;/em&gt; The Copelands’ world was once filled with unrivalled luxury and glittering social events. Now that privileged existence is nothing but a distant memory and the Copeland heirs seek to start new lives – with no-one to rely on but themselves. At least that’s what they think…!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Book 1: The Fallen Greek Bride&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Book 2: His Defiant Desert Queen&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Jane Porter&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Fallen Greek Bride &lt;em&gt;4.5* TOP PICK RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Porter makes her larger-than-life characters appeal by stripping away the opulent façade to reveal the base emotions everyone understands: hurt, anger and, most of all, love. Add breathtaking vistas and a couple whose explosive intensity is evident on every dramatic page, and you have a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;His Majesty’s Mistake &lt;em&gt;4* RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Porter paints an extravagant tale, filled with strong-yet-vulnerable characters and a satisfying against- all-odds romance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Not Fit for a King? &lt;em&gt;4.5* TOP PICK RT Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Readers will sigh when this story ends and long for more pages to read. Porter is a masterful storyteller who keeps readers riveted with great characters and a spellbinding tale.&lt;/p&gt;
