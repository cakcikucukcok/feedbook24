  <title>Baddest Bad Boys - Shannon McKenna, E. C. Sheedy, Cate Noble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These are the sexy bad boys no woman in her right mind would mess with. Except that they&#39;re wickedly irresistible, and will do anything to protect the woman they love--even if it means risking everything.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;    Anytime, Anywhere   Shannon McKenna&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  For years, Robin MacNamara has been secretly in love with her big brother&#39;s friend Jon Amendola, but the sexy cop has never seen her as anything but a kid. Until Robin follows him to an isolated cabin to prove she&#39;s all grown up. Unfortunately, Jon&#39;s last case isn&#39;t quite closed--and someone wants payback.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;  After The Lovin&#39;   E.C. Sheedy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    In need of a place to hide, Tommi Smith finds herself on the doorstep of a high school classmate&#39;s remote fishing lodge. Though Mac Fleming never trusted this knockout&#39;s reputation for breaking hearts, nothing&#39;s going to stop him from seducing her into his bed now. Until Tommi&#39;s past comes back to haunt them.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;  Deal With The Devil   Cate Noble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    All Ellie McMann DeLuca wants is one night with the only man she&#39;s ever truly loved--Max DeLuca, dubbed the Devil by the Italian paparazzi. Max agrees on one condition: they extend it to seven nights of sensual pleasure on a private island. But after a whole week of fulfilling each other&#39;s deepest desires, how will they go back to the way things were?" />
