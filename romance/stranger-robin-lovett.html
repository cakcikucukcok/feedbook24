  <title>Stranger - Robin Lovett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: Stranger by Robin Lovett is a scorching, intense romance novel featuring an anti-hero out to get revenge against the trust-fund woman whose family destroyed his life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This isn&#39;t supposed to be a love story. This is not the kind of book where a girl gets swept off her feet.  Where the hero is her knight in shining armor.  This is a novel about ruining someone&#39;s life.  But even the simplest plans for revenge can go wrong.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the way he watches me, this man I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s something I&#39;ll never confess to, never tell a soul. But with one look of those penetrating eyes, I feel as if he&#39;s unwrapped me, turned me inside out, rubbed away at my trust-fund-holding, good-girl exterior until I&#39;m raw and exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looks like he wants to destroy me. Like he wants to obliterate me and my shallow, perfect life until there&#39;s nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once I meet Logan, the crazy part is, I want him to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate Penny Vandershall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate her money and her family and her privilege. I hate her innocence and her smile and her shine. I want to annihilate her lightness and consume her with my darkness, my anger, my red-hot rage until there is nothing left of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know the truth about her, the truth that will make it easy to bring her down. To ruin her for good. But through the blinding haze of my hatred, my burning need for revenge, she&#39;s starting to get to me. She looks at me in wide-eyed fear, like a girl approaching the tiger&#39;s cage. And yet she refuses to walk away; edging closer until she can meet the beast who wants to rip her apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though I set out to ruin her, she may be the one to destroy me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stranger by Robin Lovett is a dark and intriguing story about the lengths one will go to find love. A page turner from the very beginning, this story makes you question, in the best of ways, what a romance is. A five star read!&quot; - &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Jenika Snow on &lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wowza! I just couldn&#39;t put this down.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;The Jeep Diva &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt; quite boldly goes where many romances don&#39;t go...about the blurred boundaries between depravity, pleasure and despair, and how freedom...can be found in the most unexpected places.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Unstuck Pages &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a series of standalones by Robin Lovett that can be read separately or in this order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Stranger, a dark stalker romance &lt;br&gt;Book 2: Deceiver, a dark revenge romance &lt;br&gt;Book 3: Keeper, a dark captive romance&lt;/p&gt;" />
