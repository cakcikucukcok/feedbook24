          &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes not even the forbidden can be denied…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No sooner had his brother been laid to rest when a moment of grief and confusion exploded into passion for Sawyer Riggan and his newly widowed sister-in-law, Lynn. It was an earthshaking encounter neither could forget, but had it left more than memories behind…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lynn believed empty bank accounts and cruel jibes in her late husband&#39;s diary were his only legacy to her, but there may be another growing in her womb. With the father of her child in question, the marriage of convenience Sawyer suggested might be all too convenient given the fires that still burned between them. For when the true paternity was revealed, what future might they share?&lt;/p&gt;
