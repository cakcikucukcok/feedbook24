          &lt;strong&gt;Fabulous Fathers&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Cowboy and his Lady&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It had been five years since Buck Riley had held Jessie in his arms, five long, lonely years. Now just one look brought the memories flooding back….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;…and &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; Baby?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A second look filled Buck with questions. About where she had been since then. And about her little boy, Gopher, whose big blue eyes were mysteriously like his own. Logic had told Buck that Gopher couldn&#39;t possibly be his. But Jessie was definitely hiding &lt;em&gt;something.&lt;/em&gt; What secrets had driven her from town all those years ago? Buck was determined to uncover the truth–and claim the woman &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; and her child as his own….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Fabulous Fathers. This cowboy would make a FABULOUS FATHER!&lt;/strong&gt;
