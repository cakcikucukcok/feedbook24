  <title>Fire on the Ice - Tamsen Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Snow and Ice Games where competition is not the only thing that is heating up! The fourth book in bestselling Tamsen Parker&#39;s romance series continues with two female skaters from opposite sides of the rink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaze Bellamy is the bad girl of the short track speed skating world. Looking like a roller derby bruiser when she&#39;s not in her Team USA uniform, she&#39;s an unlikely American heroine. She&#39;s got a punk attitude to match her provocative dress and her dyed hair, and she&#39;s determined to get onto the front pages of the papers regardless of how she has to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maisy Harper is the workhorse of the Canadian women&#39;s figure skating team. Serious, modest, and above all, polite, Maisy would prefer to win her victory on the ice rather than in the press, and is exasperated by Blaze&#39;s antics. When she&#39;s not lusting after her anyway. After they both failed to make the medal podium at the last Snow and Ice Games, they drowned themselves in gin--and each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite their hookup being drunken, they both harbor fond memories of their night together and are keen for a repeat. But they&#39;ve got different ways of going about getting what they want, and Blaze&#39;s willingness to go to any lengths for the spotlight could ruin any chance she has with Maisy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
