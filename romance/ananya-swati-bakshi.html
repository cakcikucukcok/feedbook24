  <title>Ananya - Swati Bakshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ananya is a simple middle-class woman. This story is about her journey through thick and thin, moon after moon, her struggle, her faith, and most importantly, her spirit. It is about how she stumbled into the idiosyncrasies of society and then the rare triumph of her courage and her conviction. 
On her wedding night, she discovered she was married to a drug addict. A bad marriage followed despite her efforts to keep it pieced together. Without any complaint, grudge, or malice, she just took things in her stride and moved on, willingly embracing the hardships that came her way. Her only friends in her trials and tribulations were unrelenting courage and faith. 
As she was rebuilding her life, brick by brick, she met a stranger, Samarth, on the Internet on a lazy afternoon. They struck a chord instantly, and life again began to smile for Ananya. She saw a new meaning, a new direction, and a new dawn as their relationship slowly blossomed into love. 
However, the novel does not just tell the story of Ananya, but it also brings to the forefront the mind-set of our society. That it doesnt make life easier for someone wanting to live with dignity. It spreads spikes on the path." />
