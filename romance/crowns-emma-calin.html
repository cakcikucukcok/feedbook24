&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Winner of the 2017 New Apple Award for Literary Excellence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A London girl cop. A political crisis in Paris. A spark to fire the passion of love. One moment of courage to catch the destiny of history.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A surprising romantic adventure set in a very near future, when reality TV becomes real.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When single mother Sergeant Sophia Castellana stumbles into a terrorist shooting and kidnap in London, things are not as they seem. The mysterious young man she rescues is the star of a worldwide reality TV show and demands to have Sophia as his personal bodyguard.&amp;nbsp; He also has a secret that makes him a key player in a high-power international political plot into which Sophia is drawn.&amp;nbsp; The love of this far younger man and the infatuation of a charismatic French woman seduce her into a blur of inappropriate love and infinite danger. Power and celebrity beckon, betrayal and violence threaten every move as events unfold in the city of Paris. Her brute courage and loving woman&amp;rsquo;s heart confront ruthless enemies who offer no second chances. She knows the streets, she knows her power as a lover. Can she, dare she seize the prizes before her? Will a world offer her the choice?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Crowns&amp;rsquo;, another stand-alone story in the &amp;lsquo;Passion Patrol Series&amp;rsquo; of suspense romance novels. Steamy Emma Calin holds nothing back to bring you her juicy mix of cops crime and passion, with a large side order of French satire sauce.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you enjoy James Patterson, Nora Roberts, Catherine Coulter and Kendra Elliot, you&amp;#39;ll love a series that combines all of their best traits in fast-paced, pulse-pounding roller-coaster adventures full of passionate steamy romance, danger and love.&lt;br /&gt;
