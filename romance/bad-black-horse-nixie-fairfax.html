  <title>Bad Black Horse - Nixie Fairfax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Cady was warned to stay away from Demon the Friesian stallion because he tends to get a bit &amp;ldquo;frisky&amp;rdquo; with young women. But curiosity gets the better of her, and she visits the horse&amp;#39;s stall when no one&amp;#39;s around. Demon soon makes it enormously clear what he wants. Before long Cady finds herself wanting it, too. Contains graphic descriptions of human-equine sexual relations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
The horse was across the stall before she even knew what was happening. She heard only a faint crackle of straw, a few quick, muffled clops, and then a massive shadow draped her. She started to whirl around, but the horse shoved her with his hoof and knocked her over onto the floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time she regained her bearings, Demon was above her, his long, strong legs all around her like the bars of a cage, his bulky torso a low black ceiling overhead. She was about to try to scramble away between his legs when he set his front right hoof on her upper chest, applying just enough pressure to pin her to the concrete without hurting her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Let me up,&amp;rdquo; she demanded. Even in the depths of her alarm she found a moment to wonder why she was still speaking barely above a whisper, why she wasn&amp;#39;t screaming at the top of her lungs. She pulled at the horse&amp;#39;s leg with both hands. It wouldn&amp;#39;t budge. It was like trying to uproot a phone pole. &amp;ldquo;Let me&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Demon stooped down, took the collar of her tank top in his big, blocky teeth, and pulled up hard. The straps snapped and the fabric ripped with a sharp, harsh sound, and when the horse raised his head again, he held the torn, limp shirt in his teeth, leaving Cady nude from the waist up, her breasts openly quivering in sync with her ragged, panting breaths. Though it was a warm night, her nipples were hard as stones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keeping her pinned with his hoof, Demon bent down again and grasped the waistband of her shorts in his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, God,&amp;rdquo; she moaned, her voice still far too low to be heard outside the stable, and then Demon tore the shorts off her, reducing them to a dark-blue rag, which he promptly spat out on the ground. Cady now wore nothing but her panties and tennis shoes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then, just as she knew he would, the horse lowered his head again. She felt his big, hard teeth graze the tender skin of her waist, making her flinch with a gasp. She felt his big, soft, fleshy lips leave smears of saliva on her smooth skin. She felt the horse&amp;#39;s breath puffing hotly on her belly. Then the pink cotton panties drew taut against her butt as the horse pulled up. Another sharp rip echoed through the stall, and now she was naked beneath the huge, tumescent animal." />
