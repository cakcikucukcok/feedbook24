  <title>Necessary Roughness - Julie Brannagh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tanner Cole&amp;#8217;s football career was over in less than thirty seconds one Sunday afternoon. After a lifetime playing the sport he loves he&amp;#8217;s been forced into an early retirement. Between figuring out his plan for the rest of his life and dealing with the pain of his injuries, this grouchy hottie isn&amp;#8217;t in the mood for the perky physical therapist who makes him ache in more than one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan Mueller doesn&amp;#8217;t have time for a sulky ex-NFL player, even one who looks like Tanner. She&amp;#8217;s done with falling for the bad boy without a heart. When she&amp;#8217;s forced out of her apartment and offered an opportunity too good to pass up, she agrees to move in with Tanner. She&amp;#8217;s only there to speed up his recovery. No funny business, even if her body is telling her otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Tanner and Jordan spend more and more time together, they begin to see each other in a new light that threatens to change everything. But when the ghosts of girlfriends past reappear, Tanner must decide if he&amp;#8217;s willing to put everything on the line for a shot at a future with Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
