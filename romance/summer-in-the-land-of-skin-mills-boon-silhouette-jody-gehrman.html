  <title>Summer in the Land of Skin (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Jody Gehrman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five-year-old Anna–restless, famished and emotionally numb–is following the long-cold trail of her father, a celebrated luthier, whose death has always haunted her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;s tracked his former business partner to a sailboat on Bellingham Bay, determined to pry from the old man the secrets of their guitarmaking trade, and maybe a few answers about her father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anna catches an echo of her musical father in Arlan, guitar player for a local band. Soon she&#39;s living on his sofa, hanging out with his girlfriend–having friends for the first time, even. And if Anna&#39;s new friends do drugs, read her journal and leave open a few too many bedroom doors, who&#39;s to say they aren&#39;t real friends? And if Anna has feelings for Arlan, who&#39;s to say where her loyalty lies?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;During a single summer&#39;s worth of days, gin-soaked and colored with longing, Anna rediscovers her senses, shut down since her father&#39;s death, and finds that the only way to get free of her past is to embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
