  <title>Arise My Love and Come Away with Me - Wendell R. Ware</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The love story of Wynn Cary and
Doey Brooks, based on a true
story, is as compelling today as
it was when it began.
Set against the violent backdrop of
World War II, Wynn and Doeys
journey explores the hopes, fears,
passion and call to duty that have
altered the lives of young lovers since
the beginning of time.
Yet theirs is a uniquely American
story. Wynn Cary has dreamed of
becoming a pilot since his youth. At
the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, he falls in love with Doey,
a beautiful young Duke University
law student who shares his passion
for flying.
As their relationship grows, the war
stalls their plans to marry. But their
poignant story is living proof that
love never dies." />
