  <title>She&#39;s Expecting (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Barbara McMahon</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;ARE YOU &lt;em&gt;PREGNANT?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jackson Witt&#39;s number one business rule was no temptation in the office. The last thing he wanted was a beautiful single woman working as his secretary–and an expectant one at that! Yet, abandoned and alone Mandy Parkerson was the only qualified candidate for the job, and when she gazed at him with her deep blue eyes, how could he refuse? Although Mandy was a painful reminder of all he&#39;d lost, her love for her unborn child and her aching vulnerability brought out his every protective instinct. How, he wondered, could he guard his wounded heart when the pregnant beauty chipped away at his vow never to fall in love again?&lt;/p&gt;
