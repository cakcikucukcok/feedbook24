  <title>Finding You - Jo Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;For fans of &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors Christina Lauren and Sally Thorne comes a hilarious romantic comedy about finding your family, finding yourself, and maybe finding love along the way.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Being adopted never made Jane Smith feel unloved, just &lt;i&gt;unlike&lt;/i&gt; the rest of her family. As her twenty-fifth birthday approaches, she is struck by an overwhelming longing to finally find her place in the world. So in a very un-Jane-like move, she books a last-minute ticket to Greece to find her birth father and the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; Jane. All she knows about him is it that he was a tour guide named Dimitri. Armed with this knowledge and several surprise boxes of condoms from her mom (not embarrassing at all), Jane takes off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Within minutes of landing she makes two important discoveries. First, everyone in Greece is named Dimitri, and second, fate might be playing a sick joke on her when a sexy tour guide called Dimitri comes to fetch her from the airport. He offers to help Jane with her search---&lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; she&#39;ll go on an adventure with him. Stable Jane would never risk a steamy vacation romance. But &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;Jane might finally be ready to listen to her heart. Will Jane find her biological father, or will she end up finding something else entirely?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Top Pick! &lt;i&gt;Almost a Bride&lt;/i&gt; put a smile on my face more than once. The dialogue was witty, the words were well-written and the heroine was one-of-a-kind.&quot; -- Harlequin Junkie" />
