  <title>Montana Vet - Ann Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHAT SHE NEEDS&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Emily Miles already has plenty on her plate. She has to care for the dogs she rescues, find staff and volunteers for her shelter, not to mention raise money to keep The Wagging Tail going. So when the new, desperately needed part-time vet starts stirring up her insides, Emily tells herself it&#39;s just gratitude she&#39;s feeling. She can&#39;t jeopardize the shelter by getting involved with Seth Pettit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Seth has his own plateful: a teenage ward who hates him, an estranged family he&#39;s trying to mend fences with and a living to make in small-town Montana. Tough but delicate Emily needs a full-time partner, and that just can&#39;t be him. Not as a vet or a man. So why does he want to be both?" />
