  <title>Bollywood Confidential - Sonia Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After seven years of slogging through film roles too embarrassing to mention, twenty-eight-year-old struggling L.A. actress Raveena Rai has finally been offered a lead! A potentially career-making turn in a major Hollywood epic, perhaps? A meaty part in a serious drama with Oscar&amp;#174; written all over it? Not! To Raveena&#39;s great dismay (and her mother&#39;s delight) she&#39;s flying off to India to star in a new Bollywood extravaganza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh well, a lead is a lead, after all. Never mind that it&#39;s a million humid degrees in Bombay, the Los Angeles of the East; that she has to live with a wacko distant uncle who sleeps under furniture and is the most stressed-out wannabe swami on the continent; that her director is a lecherous hack and his movie has the potential of being the very worst flick ever made anywhere! At least Raveena&#39;s leading man is the supremely sexy Siddharth, Bollywood&#39;s biggest star. But while their on-screen chemistry is electric-hot, off-screen the arrogant hunk treats her with total disdain ... or, worse still, ignores her. Raveena&#39;s one consolation is that things couldn&#39;t possibly get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah? Want to bet? Lights, camera, action!&lt;/p&gt;" />
