      <meta name="description" content="Book 4&amp;nbsp;of the Fifty Recipes For Disaster New Adult Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A New Adult Romance Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can Kiara settle in to her new life with Chase while Robbs is still a threat to her safety?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After another near deadly encounter with Robbs Martin, Kiara Sands flees New York City and joins her friend Jenny back in Austin, Texas. But when her plane lands, Kiara has no time to settle back in to her old life. Instead, she learns that her scholarship at Le Cordon Bleu has been revoked and no one will tell her why. Her almost boyfriend, Chase Abbott, promises to look into it for her&amp;hellip; he also gives the girls a safe place to stay until the police capture Robbs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The attraction between Kiara and Chase rekindles the moment they&amp;rsquo;re reunited but Kiara isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to start a new relationship. Jenny is still recovering from Robbs&amp;rsquo; attack and Kiara is determined to take care of her. She reluctantly agrees to go back to work at Fission because it&amp;rsquo;s the only way she&amp;rsquo;ll make enough money to survive. Chase is working in the kitchen too as Paul&amp;rsquo;s new apprentice and it makes being back at her old job easier to bare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The women struggle to put their lives back together and live with the constant fear that Robbs will return. Will the police catch Robbs before he hurts Kiara and Jenny again? Will Kiara finally let down her guard and give in to her feelings for Chase? Or will everything end in disaster?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
