  <title>Winning Love - Abby Niles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winning Love by Abby Niles&lt;br&gt;Mac &quot;The Snake&quot; Hannon has spent years throwing himself into cage fighting as a way to lash back at the natural disaster that destroyed his future. A call for help has Mac returning to the one place he swore never to return: Kansas--in the height of tornado season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There he meets free-spirited Gayle Matthews. At first he wants nothing to do with the infuriatingly persistent woman, but the crazy challenges she tosses his way are impossible to resist. As she thaws years of bitterness, bringing back the Mac he believed long gone, he starts to make peace with the past and see the future again. Until he learns she chases his worst nightmare--then he can&#39;t get away fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meteorologist and storm chaser, Gayle Matthews is no stranger to being left behind and now believes in living in the moment. She wants to do just that with the handsome extreme fighter with the achingly sad eyes. As she works to replace the sorrow with desire, she finds herself breaking her one rule: have fun but don&#39;t fall in love. When he suddenly pushes her away and she discovers the horrifying reason why, she issues one more challenge: face his fear and come on a chase with her.&lt;br&gt;Will squaring off with the past lead to a victory for heartache or love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
