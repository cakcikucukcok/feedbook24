        &lt;h2&gt;Four tempting romances from the Modern Mills &amp; Boon authors!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Heir Made in the Marriage Bed &lt;/em&gt;by Anne Mather&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;One night back in her husband&#39;s bed…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The inability to have a child left Joanna and Matt Novak&#39;s passionate marriage in tatters. But when Joanna asks her tycoon husband for a divorce, Matt makes it clear he expects them to remain married…in the most intimate of ways!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As tempers flare, the raging desire between them explodes – just once more, Matt and Joanna give in to the thrill of each other&#39;s touch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the shattering aftermath of their explosive encounter, they agree to part ways…until Joanna discovers one tiny consequence of their night together – she&#39;s carrying Matt&#39;s baby!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prince&#39;s Stolen Virgin&lt;/em&gt; by Maisey Yates&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Awakened by his kiss… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ordinary Briar Harcourt is horrified to discover her life is a lie—she is in fact a long-lost princess, sent into hiding to escape a forced marriage to a brutal king. But now his son, Prince Felipe, has found Briar and is determined to claim her as his bride!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marriage to Briar will give Felipe the power he was born for: her compliance is nonnegotiable. But his searing, uncontrollable desire for her is unexpected…and he&#39;ll use all his formidable charisma to seduce her into surrender!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protecting His Defiant Innocent&lt;/em&gt; by Michelle Smart&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tempted by her billionaire protector…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Traveling to a dangerous Caribbean island to continue her late brother&#39;s charitable work, Francesca Pellegrini finds herself under the protection of security tycoon Felipe Lorenzi. Independent Francesca is infuriated by his commands, but Felipe&#39;s every look invites her to give up her innocence to him…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With his body and heart as hard as stone after his military career, Felipe has no time for Francesca&#39;s seductive games. Until this captivating young woman entices him beyond all measure, and this lone wolf decides to throw away his strict rules and take her as his own!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pregnant at Acosta&#39;s Demand&lt;/em&gt; by Maya Blake&lt;/strong&gt;
