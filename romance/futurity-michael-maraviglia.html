  <title>Futurity - Michael Maraviglia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adriana Serannos life in New York City is not as she hoped it would be. But on a girls night out she meets the handsome Solaro through what she believes is a chance encounter; electricity sizzles the air between them. 
Solaro has lived 12,000 years as an elite member of the sacred Brotherhood of Light, a spiritual sect of an ancient Egyptian society. Its members stand for all that is holy, and they uphold the truths of God against the dark forces of the material world. Solaro and eleven of his brotherhood were chosen to remain on Earth for a special mission. But Solaros greatest test will be his attempt to reunite with Adriana, his soul mate from the distant past, and help her evolve into a master.  
Together, they will set the example to lead the human race toward a new dawn.  First, she has to fall in love with him all over again. While Solaro and Adriana forge their relationship, fallen members of the White Brotherhood attempt to stop their reunion. The newly reunited lovers find their lives in danger and become immersed in a game of faith and illusion where nothing is as it seems." />
