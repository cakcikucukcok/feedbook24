Feeling nothing at all is far better than being hurt again.

Despite the terrible darkness of his past, there&#39;s an undeniable goodness in him. And even though she knows the cost, Crystal finds herself drawn to Gabriel. His quiet strength is wearing down her defenses and his gentle patience is causing her to question everything she thought she knew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Only love can mend a shattered heart . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Crystal and Gabriel never imagined that the world, which had stolen everything from them, would bring them a deep love like this. Except fate will only take them so far, and now the choice is theirs: Harden their hearts once again or find the courage to shed their painful pasts." />
