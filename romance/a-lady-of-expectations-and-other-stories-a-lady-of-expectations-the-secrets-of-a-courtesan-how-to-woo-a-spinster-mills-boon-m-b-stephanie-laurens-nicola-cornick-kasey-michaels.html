  <title>A Lady of Expectations and Other Stories: A Lady Of Expectations / The Secrets of a Courtesan / How to Woo a Spinster (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Stephanie Laurens, Nicola Cornick, Kasey Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From acclaimed authors Stephanie Laurens, Nicola Cornick and Kasey Michaels come three enchanting tales to exceed expectations.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Lady of Expectations &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jack Lester seeks the perfect bride—one who is attractive and kind, but who also loves him in spite of his wealth. Which is why he keeps this trifling detail hidden. But when Sophie Winterton enters his life, believing he must marry into wealth to run his family’s estate, how will he convince her that she is the woman he desires—and that he can be the husband she deserves?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Secrets of a Courtesan &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Eve Nightingale thought she had put her past as mistress to the Duke of Welburn behind her. But when the handsome duke strolls into her small village, she finds it hard to keep her secrets concealed…and to keep her heart from stirring for him once again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Missives &amp; Mistletoe&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Governess Maggie Stover is outraged when she is coerced into harboring a pirate in her home, lest her family face eviction. Though she may have a change of heart when she realizes the pirate is in fact the long-lost, and devilishly alluring, Duke of Trevere.&lt;/p&gt;
