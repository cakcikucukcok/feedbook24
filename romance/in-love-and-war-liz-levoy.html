&lt;b&gt;Book 1: Hotel Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gia has a lot on her plate. Her mother&amp;rsquo;s disease is taking over, the restaurant is a full-time responsibility and with billionaire boyfriend Steven taking over medical costs, Gia feels cornered and obliged to keep everyone happy. But her life is going the way she needed for it to go and she can&amp;rsquo;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Until Jack, her first love returns from war. An unresolved past keeps reappearing with him back in her life and she&amp;rsquo;ll never forget what he was to her, but he&amp;rsquo;s a changed man after everything he&amp;rsquo;s seen and been through and there&amp;rsquo;s no way she can turn her back on everything she has going for her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gia has to decide who and what is important to her but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to follow her head when her heart keeps interfering. At the end of the day, she&amp;rsquo;ll have to decide who can stay in her heart and who will have to leave.&lt;br /&gt;
