  <title>Missing Pieces - Cyndi Mathis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Missing Pieces&quot; is a story about a 33- year old woman named Charlene Wilson from Macon Georgia. Charlene now lives in Atlanta and is an up and coming Attorney with a prestigious Law Firm. Charlene is a beautiful, brilliant, self made woman and has had to make some tough life altering decisions in the past. None of those other decisions can hold a candle to the decisions that she has to make once she meets and falls in love with Jonathan Walker, a 35- year old Recording Label Executive that she meets at a local Atlanta hotspot. When Charlene and her best friend, Sharon, went to the club one night she was not looking for a man, but she found the love of her life, Jonathan Walker.
Sharon had been Charlene&#39;s best friend for years; however, Charlene occasionally questioned Sharon&#39;s true feelings towards her. Was Sharon really proud of her friends success or was there something lurking behind her sometimes fake smiles?
Jonathan wooed and romanced Charlene until she reluctantly fell head over heels in love with him. Jonathan&#39;s twin brother James was happily married to Marilyn, his soul mate, and they had a beautiful little boy. James was happy that his brother had found someone to share his life with and knew that Jonathan and Charlene were made for each other. 
James and Marilyn had met after Marilyn&#39;s fiance had been killed in a car accident on New Year&#39;s Eve and they were very happy together even though Marilyn was still haunted by her love for her dead fiance. C.J., their son, was the light of his parents&#39; life and they were devastated when he became gravely ill.
Charlene and Jonathan&#39;s love is put to the ultimate test when in the midst of this family crisis a life shattering secret from Charlene&#39;s past is abruptly revealed and Charlene comes face to face with a past that she thought was buried forever. Will Jonathan be able to forgive Charlene&#39;s past and love her unconditionally or will she lose the love she&#39;s waited a lifetime to find?" />
