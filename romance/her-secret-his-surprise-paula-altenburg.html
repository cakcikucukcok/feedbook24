  <title>Her Secret, His Surprise - Paula Altenburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cass Stone doesn&#39;t let anything faze her. Since being disowned by her strict father, she&#39;s spent her adulthood trying to prove him wrong. Not even an incredible and mysterious one-night stand that leaves her a single mom can trip her up...until the father of her baby stumbles back into her life, as sexy and enigmatic as ever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan Alexander hasn&#39;t forgotten the night he spent with Cass two years ago, but he never expects to end up undercover at her work. His job saves lives--like it should have saved his brother--and he can&#39;t afford complications. It&#39;s difficult enough to maintain his cover as a carefree wanderer when he realizes his attraction to Cass hasn&#39;t faded...and then he meets her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
