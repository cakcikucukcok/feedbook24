  <title>Susana and the Scot - Sabrina York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New York Times bestselling author Sabrina York carries readers back to the wild Scottish Highlands in Susana and the Scot, where the bravest of men surrender to no one-except the boldest of women...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Scotland, 1813.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A SCANDALOUS TEMPTATION&lt;br&gt;  Andrew Lochlannach is famous for his conquests, on and off the battlefield. When a fellow warrior challenges him to a kissing contest, he wastes no time in planting his lips on ninety-nine lovely lasses-an impressive feat of seduction that gets him banished to the hinterlands. Still, Andrew has no regrets about his exploits-especially his embrace with the most beguiling woman he&#39;s ever met...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  AN UNDENIABLE PASSION&lt;br&gt;  With flaming red hair and a temper to match, Susana is not some innocent farmgirl who gives herself over easily to a man, even one as ruggedly handsome as Andrew. The wicked Scot may have won a kiss from the headstrong beauty in a moment of mutual desire, but Susana refuses to be just another one of his conquests. Andrew must convince the fiery lass that even though he is not playing a game, losing her is not an option...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; &quot;You can&#39;t go wrong with a Sabrina York story.&quot;-Desiree Holt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
