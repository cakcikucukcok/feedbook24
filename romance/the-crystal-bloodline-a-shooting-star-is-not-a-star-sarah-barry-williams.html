  <title>The Crystal Bloodline: A Shooting Star is Not a Star - Sarah Barry Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A shooting star is not a star. When twenty-one year old Rachel Coast meets Austin Jacobs, a young and extremely handsome photographer, she immediately falls for his charms and is left curious after overhearing a conversation between Austin and his father about their past. Unexpectedly, Austin asks her to help him launch a photographic studio and soon an intense romance blossoms between the inseparable pair. The studio is an instant success, curiously attracting the support of reclusive billionaire, Conik Penster Dewe. However, all is not as it seems and soon it is revealed that he has an ulterior motive. He has been interested in Austin since the day he was born, and has been keeping a watchful eye on him from the shadows ever since. The billionaire needs something from Austin, and he will stop at nothing to procure it. Austin&amp;#39;s career as an international fashion photographer unexpectedly begins to flourish. However, his health and relationship with Rachel begin to suffer as a consequence and, as the turbulence unfolds, their once solid relationship begins to fall apart. He tries to fight the change within him, but will he succeed?&lt;/p&gt;" />
