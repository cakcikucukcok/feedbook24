  <title>Weltrus - New Beginnings - Xandy Vee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is written in the period 1939  1949.
Harvey leaves his ancestral home in anger! Two years later comes the urgent plea, Come home, there is no one to oversee Weltrus!
Unknowingly he has inherited Weltrus by nomination! 
Remembering his grandmothers dying words, Do not throw it all away! 
He returns to Weltrus, but not alone! He is now a married man of twenty four hours!
On arrival, his wife, Bessie falls in love with Weltruss rambling old house, and takes up the challenge to bring it back to what it was when his grandmother was alive!
Her love and compassion brings back his parents to Weltrus in such a unique way.
Then working in unity against all the odds, these four people achieve this mammoth task. 
Their main objective being to place Weltrus back on the map in the wine industry!  
This takes a decade of uncovering the many hidden mysteries behind the Weltrus Legacy to do just that!
Harvey knows that his lovely young wife is a born winner, whose goal is to see that their love is based on her belief of New Beginnings bringing happiness and joy!" />
