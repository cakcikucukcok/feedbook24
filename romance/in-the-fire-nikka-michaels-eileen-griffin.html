  <title>In the Fire - Nikka Michaels, Eileen Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Because the way to a man&amp;#39;s heart&amp;#133;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Eight years ago, the world was their oyster. Until, that is, competing chefs Ethan Martin and James Lassiter&amp;#39;s hot and heavy relationship fizzled after Jamie left for an internship in Paris. Even though Jamie&amp;#39;s career has taken off since his return to the States, with his own television show and a lot of fame, his feelings for Ethan have never quite gone away.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Ethan&amp;#39;s culinary career has developed more slowly, but he&amp;#39;s almost saved enough to buy the restaurant where he works and re-open it as his dream spot, Bistro 30. If only he could get the sexy chef who loved him and left him out of his mind.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;But when someone starts sabotaging the restaurant and a fire threatens to take away everything Ethan holds dear, his only option is to rely on Jamie for help. Back in close quarters, the two men will have to find a way to work through their past if they hope to save the restaurant&amp;#151;and their future.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;See how Ethan and Jamie&amp;#39;s romance began in&lt;/em&gt; In the Raw, &lt;em&gt;available now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;93,000 words" />
