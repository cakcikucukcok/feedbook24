      <meta name="description" content="Sage thought that she had found the perfect man to share her life with, but that all changed the day Reef walked out the door without a word. Devastated and confused, Sage pulls herself together, determined to start a new life on her own. She starts a new business, buys a small home, and believes that life is back on track again.
Then she learns that she is pregnant with twins. 
Alone and scared, she knows that she is vulnerable to her own hormones and fears. Reef appears one day, saying that he wants to be a part of her life again, but Sage doesnt trust him. She hides her pregnancy from him, but not from his sister. Sage struggles to keep her life in order and disciplined when everything seems to be spinning out of control around her. And just when she thinks that it cant get any more stressful, an unknown person starts threatening her safety, her businessand her sanity. 
For Sage, her life is now a whirlwind of drama, madcap adventures, sexy interludes, and a quest to find herself. Can she find the calm within the storm?" />
