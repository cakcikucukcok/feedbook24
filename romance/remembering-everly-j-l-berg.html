  <title>Remembering Everly - J.L. Berg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After two years in a coma, August Kinkaid has forgotten the darkness in his past. But his past hasn&#39;t forgotten him. His beautiful former fiancée, Everly, remembers every tumultuous moment of their stormy relationship. The sizzling passion. The web of lies. And the terrible secret Everly&#39;s been hiding since her last fateful night with August.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now the truth is out and August remembers everything. As his long-buried memories come flooding back, he begins to understand why Everly would want to move on with her life. Why she would give her heart to another man. And why August should try to forget her once and for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  But he can&#39;t give up on the only woman he&#39;s ever loved. Even if he has to reopen old wounds--and face the darkest demons of his past--August will do whatever it takes for a second chance with Everly. He let her slip away once. He&#39;s not about to spend the rest of his life remembering Everly when he could be holding her in his arms forever . . ." />
