      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desire won&#39;t take &lt;i&gt;no &lt;/i&gt;for an answer in &lt;i&gt;The Right Kind of Trouble &lt;/i&gt;by Shiloh Walker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the small Southern town of McKay&#39;s Treasure, everybody knows that the handsome local police chief, Gideon Marshall, has been carrying a torch for Moira McKay. It&#39;s also no secret that Moira has been rejecting Gideon since...forever. But after an attack from a mysterious stranger bent on taking down the McKay family, Moira becomes filled with distrust toward most men. Now she wonders whether she&#39;s been wrong about Gideon all along--and if it&#39;s not too late to admit him back into her life...and into her bed...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gideon has finally convinced his wasted heart to give up on Moira, who he&#39;s loved since he was sixteen years old. Moira&#39;s attack changes everything, however--and he vows to protect her. But how much is he willing to risk for a woman who&#39;s always kept him at bay...until now? And is it too late for Moira to tell him that her love for him has always been locked deep in her heart--and he holds the key?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &quot;Shiloh Walker&#39;s writing just gets better and better...[and] the sex is sizzling.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; --&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
