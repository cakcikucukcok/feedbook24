  <title>Heart of the Cotswolds - England - M. L. Buchman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="-a Love Abroad B&amp;B romance-
Welcome to the Cotswolds of England. Old stone villages, scenic rolling hills dotted with sheep, and quiet pubs serving local beers abound. Come stay in The Queen’s Guard pub and B&amp;B, put your feet up by the fire, and settle in.
Former Delta Force Sergeant Aaron Mason did just that. He’d received his military retirement along with a shot-up knee and a cane. He finds a certain contentment when he takes up a job from his youth, apprenticing himself to a stonemason.	
That marginal contentment gets blown to hell when Jane Tully storms into his favorite pub, desperate for help—anyone’s help. She must find a way to survive her sister’s wedding. Except she’s never needed help before and doesn’t know how to ask. 
Nothing in their past prepared either of them for their present. And their future? It lies beyond imagining. But they aren’t alone. Help arrives from the most unexpected sources, as it always does in the Heart of the Cotswolds." />
