  <title>The Angel and The Captain - Kaitlyn K.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A funny, romantic explicitly naughty full-length about the Captain, an older man, and Angel, a younger woman. They fall in love and marry and do normal things like edit a best-selling book and run for the United States Senate. A warm and funny story about the tenderest love and the rawest lust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
My Captain looked me over, took both my hands and said I was every man&amp;rsquo;s dream. I was, of course, but I needed to hear that. It would be the last time I was insecure with him. He made me feel special and, well, so me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Captain let me walk into the restaurant a bit ahead of him. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for an audience, but I seemed to have one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rsquo;s everybody looking over here?&amp;rdquo; I asked, looking back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Captain put his hands on my waist and his mouth near my ear, which always turned me on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Because they wish they were you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I began to cry. People wishing they were me! Imagine!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is anybody wishing they were you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Captain laughed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, probably&amp;nbsp; not,&amp;rdquo; he said with a smile. &amp;ldquo;Well every swinging dick, in here is, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Captain turned me around and looked into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No man has ever been out with a woman as pretty as you are tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s not possible&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All right, a second time crying. Or maybe it was a continuation of the first. There would be other times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He knew the waiter! That was OK. He told this was not the first time he&amp;rsquo;d been here and that he&amp;rsquo;d come here with other women.&amp;nbsp; Didn&amp;rsquo;t matter because they weren&amp;rsquo;t there. I was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then Mr. Barrett made me cry! He said I was stunningly beautiful and that the stars were dancing for them because I had favored them with my presence tonight. He told my Captain he had exceeded his usual high standards and that I was shining amid the brightness, or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That made the tears come again, let me tell you. Me, shining amid brightness!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We danced, too! The night was perfect! Champagne, my first caviar, some goose stuff I still can&amp;rsquo;t pronounce and dancing! They had a live band. They played songs I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know, but the Captain did and we danced a lot. Now, my Captain is a lousy dancer, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid, but I&amp;rsquo;m not and I made sure he did OK, because a girl looks out for her man. I mean, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have him falling and breaking a hip at his advanced age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our last dance was right before dessert. It was a slow song, and we spent a lot of it looking into each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes. No words, because what were we going to say?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We both knew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The great love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More weeping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I almost tore his arm out its socket walking back to the room. I held his hand and hugged his arm and good God, I did not want this walk to end. I could&amp;rsquo;ve have walked with him all night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As it was, our walk would last forever.&lt;br /&gt;
