  <title>A Good Rake is Hard to Find - Manda Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A DANGEROUS GAME&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Heartbroken by the loss of her brother, Miss Leonora Craven vows to uncover the truth about his &quot;accident,&quot; which seems to have been anything but. Jonathan Craven was involved with the Lords of Anarchy, a notorious driving club, and Leonora can&#39;t help but suspect foul play. But the only way she can infiltrate their reckless inner circle is to enlist the help of Jonny&#39;s closest ally, Lord Frederick Lisle. If only he didn&#39;t also happen to be the man who broke Leonora&#39;s heart... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AN UNDENIABLE DESIRE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Frederick isn&#39;t surprised to find gorgeous, headstrong Leonora playing detective, but he knows that the Lords of Anarchy mean business--and he has no choice but to protect her. A sham engagement to Leonora will allow Frederick to bring her into the club and along for the ride. But it isn&#39;t long before pretending to be lovers leads to very real passion. With everything to lose, is their tempestuous affair worth the risk?&lt;/p&gt;" />
