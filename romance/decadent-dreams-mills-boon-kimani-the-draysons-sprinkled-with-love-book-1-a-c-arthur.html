          &lt;strong&gt;Resist temptation… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It looks like Belinda Drayson-Jones has it all together. Smart and attractive, she is one of the most talented bakers at Lillian’s, her family’s famed Chicago patisserie. Belinda is one of those women who never shows up late, never makes a faux pas, never does anything that would raise someone’s eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet perfection has its price, and the beautiful Ms. Drayson-Jones feels that something is missing from her life. And no one would ever guess the secret she&#39;s keeping. …or give in to love? Malik Anthony knows plenty about keeping secrets. He has worked with Belinda for years and has been fighting his feelings just as long.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Malik always considered her to be unattainable, until one night when their simmering desire suddenly reaches the boiling point. And if he isn’t mistaken, Belinda is now coming on to him. What could be more irresistible than being seduced by the boss’s granddaughter? What could be more perfect than giving in?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;The Draysons: Sprinkled With Love Passion has never been this sweet!&lt;/em&gt;
