  <title>Going Deep - Anne Calhoun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE&#39;LL ROCK HIS WORLD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  After weeks on a sold-out tour, singer Cady Ward is coming home for the holidays. But after one too many episodes of fan-craziness, Cady&#39;s manager decides that she needs protection--in the form of muscled cop Conn McCormick. Longing for peace and quiet to prepare before her next album drops, Cady doesn&#39;t need a bodyguard just to deal with some vague email threats...though she can&#39;t deny that close proximity to Conn&#39;s body is a very nice place to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conn is in the midst of a career scandal when his boss assigns him to pop-star guard duty. It&#39;s a poor use of his skills, even though Cady&#39;s feisty nature proves the perfect distraction for Conn while Internal Affairs investigates his case. What begins as a sizzling attraction becomes something deeper than either Conn or Cady could have expected. But when Conn uncovers the sinister plan behind the threats to Cady, he&#39;s faced with a professional dilemma: To save her life, will he risk having a future with the only woman who&#39;s ever touched his soul?   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;What these bestselling authors have to say about Anne Calhoun&#39;s romances&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Scintillating sexual chemistry!&quot;--Lauren Dane    &lt;br&gt;  &quot;Uncommonly good storytelling.&quot;--Beth Kery&lt;/p&gt;" />
