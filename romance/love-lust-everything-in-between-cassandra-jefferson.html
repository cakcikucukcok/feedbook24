      <meta name="description" content="Steve and his wife Virgil have a seductive taste for love and lust.
The sexy couple has a wide open agreement with the conclusion,
that it is okay to have sexual encounters in front of each other
while the other one watches undisclosed. This couple that is just
shy of Polyamorous, enjoy the pleasure of turning each other on
through infidelity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Virgil on the other hand has her own personal agenda. Steve is
constantly on tour with his music band. Virgil decides that she
is tired of just being a housewife and mother. It all started on a
play date with her sister and ended with her first endless nights of
pleasure and bliss. She created an unknown pattern of parners with
the inability of control.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Love, Lust, &amp; Everything in Between is a steamy read. It paralyze
your eyes to each word without the option to stop until the book is
