  <title>Royal Pain - Ashley Brow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At Silver Leaf Academy, Christa Whitherstone isnt exactly like all the other students. Shes beautiful and rich, yes, but so are a lot of the girls in her group. So what does Christa have that they dont? Royal blood, for one. Christa is the daughter of King William of Les Cerpet, an ancient island nation. Christa knows that being a princess isnt easy, and its about to get a whole lot more complicated.
Christa is in love with Daemen, a handsome, hard-working peasant who lives and works on the castle grounds. Unfortunately, her father, King William, will never approve of the match and it appears that he wants her to marry someone else. Despite the kings disapproval, Christa continues to see Daemen, and plots to escape from her fathers domineering clutches.
The two star-crossed lovers have little idea of what awaits them, or of just how powerful her father, bent on marrying his daughter to another, can be. With a little manipulation, a bit of blackmail, and some help from a very special friend, Christa is about to make some waves in the royal castle. But those choices might force her down a path she doesnt want to take, and may very well threaten a future with Daemen" />
