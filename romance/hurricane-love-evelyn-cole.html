  <title>Hurricane Love - Evelyn Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="AIDS and Alzheimer&#39;s in the Eighties--tempest spawned love
Daniel Lawrence, a superior court judge, is being tried for the assisted suicide of his wife, a young victim of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. He wants justice defined in the light of personal commitment. His defense: no malice aforethought. Joanna Archer, 20 years his junior, is the court reporter on his trial. She escapes from a bullying husband and craves personal autonomy. She and Dan meet during Hurricane Irene in Miami and begin the strange intertwining of dependency patterns, the gaining and giving up of control, a common struggle. Joanna&#39;s friend and colleague discovers she&#39;s an AIDS carrier and must deny her unhealthy need for sex,  thereby denying Dan&#39;s defense lawyers need for love. Ralph, Dan&#39;s friend since surviving a capsized boat with him in a 1938 hurricane, has his wife&#39;s stomach pumped when she attempts suicide with pills. He needs her alive; she hates him. Each character in values autonomy. Some gain it; some give it up. The suspense of the novel lies in who; the depth lies in how." />
