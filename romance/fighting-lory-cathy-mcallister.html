  <title>Fighting Lory - Cathy McAllister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FBI Agent Lory is beside herself when she wakes up in a small metal room to find that she has been abducted by aliens to be sold at a galactic slave market. She succeeds in escaping from the slave traders, but just as she thinks she has her return ticket to earth in her pocket a colossal alien comes along, determined to rescue her. Lory does not need a man to rescue her and most definitely not one who ignites an unimaginable flame in her body.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kordan, the general of the Arr&amp;rsquo;Carthian, just wants to do his job: save a helpless woman from unscrupulous slave traders. But this woman turns out to be anything but helpless and she absolutely does not want to be rescued. He would just leave her to her fate were it not for this overpowering desire to possess her and claim her as his mate." />
