  <title>The Wife&#39;s Doggy Position - David Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Carla has found her own solution to wild dreams she never expected to come true.&amp;mdash;bestiality. This story of sex with dogs presents a dilemma that confronts all of us, in one form or another. We cannot pass judgment on this housewife&amp;rsquo;s solution. We can only look at her with an open mind and hope that we can learn something. Will Carla learn humiliation and shame after selecting a dog as her lover?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Well, I got carried away. I don&amp;#39;t suppose that you&amp;#39;ve ever fucked a dog?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Molly shook her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carla continued: &amp;ldquo;Anyhow, I wanted that dog! I called him into the house one day, and played with his prick for a while. Then, after he was nice and big and hard, I got down on my hands and knees... doggy style, you know?&amp;rdquo; She grinned impishly. &amp;ldquo;The brute fucked my ass off. After that, he used to come over all the time, whining and scratching at the door. You know how dogs are. If there&amp;#39;s some pussy going, they can&amp;#39;t get enough of it. So I used to get fucked by this collie two or three times a week. It was nice. But one day, Carl came home unexpectedly and found the dog stuck up me. It was embarrassing, to say the least. And the dog was into the finishing strokes, too, so he couldn&amp;#39;t stop and I couldn&amp;#39;t stop him. So we just kept right on fucking, with my husband standing there with his mouth hanging open and his eyes popping out like a pair of hard boiled eggs. Then the dog shot his load in me. Carl had a big hard-on, himself, by that time. I tried to apologize. I even tried to claim that the dog had raped me. But Carl wouldn&amp;#39;t believe that. He took me to bed and fucked my ass off... then he told me he wanted a divorce. Well, I couldn&amp;#39;t very well contest it, could I? I mean, how would I have felt, in court, when a fucking dog was cited as the co-respondent?&amp;rdquo; Carla giggled. &amp;ldquo;Imagine a collie taking the witness stand? The lawyer would say: &amp;#39;And did you have carnal knowledge of the accused?&amp;#39; And the fucking dumb dog would say: &amp;#39;Woof!&amp;#39; So Carl got his divorce. Actually, it didn&amp;#39;t bother me very much. I was getting kind of sick of Carl, anyhow... and the dog was a better fuck, besides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Molly was astounded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her teeth clicked against the rim of her glass as she took a sip of her gin and tonic. How could a woman fuck an animal? How could a woman admit she&amp;#39;d fucked an animal? She didn&amp;#39;t know Carla very well. They were just casual acquaintances, and it was hardly the sort of thing you told to just anybody. Still, maybe it was easier to tell it to a relative stranger than to a close friend. It wasn&amp;#39;t the sort of thing that you told, say, to your sister. As well as being shocked and surprised, Molly found herself intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What... what is it like, doing it with a dog?&amp;rdquo; she asked." />
