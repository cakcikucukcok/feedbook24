  <title>Momma&#39;s Boy, Sister&#39;s Boyfriend - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Vacationing can be fun, especially when traveling with two beautiful women. It&amp;rsquo;s even more fun when the women are your gorgeous mother and your beautiful, willing sister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I released my hold on her nipple, but again she shook her head. &amp;ldquo;Stay.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I went back to sucking, gently. She rewarded me with a contented smile, and returned her hand to my chest, caressing me, moving slowly lower, to my stomach. She pulled at my shirt, uncovering me, and I pulled in a breath when she curled her fingers, held it as she pulled her nails across my skin. My stomach fluttered when she turned her gaze on my crotch, on the bulge there. On impulse, I flexed my cock. She moaned softly. &amp;ldquo;Always so hard,&amp;rdquo; she murmured, almost to her self.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I held my breath as her hand began to move, released it as a low moan when she brushed over me, and I withheld a groan when she closed her fingers, gripping me. &amp;ldquo;Jesus, baby, what are you hiding in here?&amp;rdquo; She released me, her hand returning to my stomach, her gaze to mine. &amp;ldquo;Please be careful with that. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m ready to be a grandmother.&amp;rdquo;" />
