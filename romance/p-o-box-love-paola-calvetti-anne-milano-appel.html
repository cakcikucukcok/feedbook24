  <title>P.O. Box Love - Paola Calvetti, Anne Milano Appel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A charming epistolary novel that chronicles the love story between Emma and Frederico, former high school sweethearts who meet again thirty years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Dreams &amp; Desires, 50-year-old Emma&#39;s quaint bookshop in Milan dedicated to romantic fiction, the passionate bookseller serves coffee and tea to her customers and completes order slips in pen rather than using a computer. One day, she finds a mysterious handwritten note stuck between the pages of a novel. The message is from her high school sweetheart Frederico, who is now a successful architect in New York and whom she hasn&#39;t seen in thirty years. When she finally meets Frederico again, Emma is convinced that her life is about to turn into a romance novel - an intercontinental fairy tale between Milan and New York, between two post office boxes and two lovers that are separated by the Atlantic Ocean and half a life. But Frederico is married, and their epistolary romance, punctuated by once-a-year sojourns on the island of Belle Ile, seems to have no future. Paola Calvetti&#39;s &lt;i&gt;PO Box Love&lt;/i&gt; is an ode to old-fashioned relationships (the ones that last a lifetime), old-fashioned habits (such as writing letters by hand in fountain pen) and old-fashioned notions (such as politeness, and the great lost art of conversation), and will enchant readers of such perennial favorites as &lt;i&gt;84 Charing Cross Road&lt;/i&gt; by Helene Hanff and &lt;i&gt;Same Time Next Year&lt;/i&gt; by Bernard Slade.&lt;/p&gt;" />
