      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Buckle up&amp;#8212;the argeneaus are back in a sexy, witty new novel from New York times bestselling author Lynsay Sands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dante Notte has heard it said that love hurts. He just wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting it to run him over in an RV. Still, a punctured lung and broken ribs are nothing compared to the full-body shock he feels whenever he&amp;#8217;s near the vehicle&amp;#8217;s driver, Mary Winslow. He needs to keep her safe from their pursuers while he rescues his brother. Most challenging of all, he needs to claim this smart, stubborn woman as his life mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The naked, injured, insanely gorgeous younger man who clambered into her RV insists they belong together. If Mary wasn&amp;#8217;t feeling their incredible connection in every inch of her being, she wouldn&amp;#8217;t believe it. But now that the men who took Dante&amp;#8217;s twin are after her too, trusting her gut means risking her life for an immortal who&amp;#8217;s the very definition of a perfect stranger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
