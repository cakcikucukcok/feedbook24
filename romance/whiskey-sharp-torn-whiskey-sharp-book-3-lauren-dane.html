  <title>Whiskey Sharp: Torn (Whiskey Sharp, Book 3) - Lauren Dane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes what you find isn&#39;t what you were searching for.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beau Petty has been searching his whole life. Searching for a place that fills all the empty spaces in him. Searching for a way to tame the restlessness. Searching for answers to the secret he’s never stopped trying to solve. What he wasn’t searching for was a woman to claim all of him, but when Cora Silvera walks back into his life, he’s ready to search out all the ways he can make her his.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cora has spent her life as the family nurturer, taking care of others. But now she’s ready to pass that job on to someone else. It’s time to make some changes and live for herself. It’s in that moment that her former teenage crush re-appears and the draw and the heat of their instant connection is like nothing either of them have experienced. He craves being around her. She accepts him, dark corners and all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beau thinks Cora&#39;s had enough drama in her life. He wants to protect her from the secrets of his past, even if it means holding back the last pieces of himself. But Cora is no pushover and she means to claim all those pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
