          &lt;strong&gt;The Cattleman’s Ready-Made Family&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tess Laing moved to Bellaroo Creek with her orphaned niece and nephew for a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unlucky in love, she is surprised when meeting tall, dark and deliciously handsome Cameron Manning starts a flutter in her heart… But can Cam accept this ready-made family and find a happy-ever-after or will Tess be disappointed in love again?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Miracle in Bellaroo Creek&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whoever said a broken heart was the end of the world never met Milla Brady! In desperate need of a distraction, she sets her sights on reviving her parents’ bakery. But, when a tall, handsome blast from the past turns up, Milla’s calm feathers are distinctly ruffled! Especially when she finds out what Ed Cavanaugh is keeping secret…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Patchwork Family in the Outback&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since his wife abandoned him and their children, Harrison Black has learnt the art of keeping his distance, but the beautiful new teacher Poppy Carter doesn’t seem to understand boundaries! When a storm traps them together, Harrison discovers that Poppy is not only beautiful, she makes him feel whole again.&lt;/p&gt;
