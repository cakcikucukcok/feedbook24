          &lt;strong&gt;MORE FAMILY, LESS FEUD &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The retail dynasty that had steamrollered city planner Gideon Thatcher’s grandfather decades ago had now sent beautiful emissary January Camden to make amends. Now Gideon was falling for the enemy…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was tough enough for Jani to convince Gideon the Camdens were sincere – convincing herself she felt nothing for him was the real trick. He simply didn’t fit into her baby plans; she wasn’t lucky in love, but she would soon be a mother, on her own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or could they repair the wounds of the past together…and build one family from the shards of two?&lt;/p&gt;
