Highland Lairds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Married by Decree&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is her family&#39;s ancient foe, but never has Lady Joanna Macdonald seen a man she wants more. Still, she hides from Rory MacLean&amp;#8212;the dashing lairs whom King James has ordered her to marry&amp;#8212;hoping to save her family&#39;s honor. For the pretty young lass knows that once she is wed, her trembling passion will be a difficult secret to keep hidden from her determined bridegroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bound by Desire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Rory MacLean, this marriage was merely a means to secure his fortune. But when he finally sets eyes upon his heiress bride, Rory is enraptured, and determined to have her, body and soul. But first the rugged Highlands warrior has to the spirited, innocent beauty desire the man she has been taught all her life to hate. And by slow and sinful seduction, Rory MacLean will show sweet Joanna that he is truly the husband her heart is destined for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
