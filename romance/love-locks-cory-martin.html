  <title>Love Locks - Cory Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get swept away to Paris with a second chance romance...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once upon a time in Paris, Lindsey, an idealistic young painter, and Jack, the son of a hotel owner, fell in love. Before Lindsey returned to New York, she and Jack wanted to attach a lock to the Pont de Arts bridge—a traditional way to symbolize their eternal devotion.
&lt;p&gt;
But they accidentally dropped their lock into the river. And although they made plans for Jack to join her in New York, he never did.
Twenty years have passed. Lindsey, now a divorced businesswoman, has returned to Paris with her daughter, who will be studying art at the Sorbonne. Lindsey’s own dreams of being an artist are long gone.
&lt;p&gt;
When Lindsey and Jack meet again, all their memories come rushing back...along with their regrets. Could they recapture the magic they shared when they were young? Or will it be too late for a love they once believed would last forever? 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This book includes a free recipe for French Potato Salad with Haricot Verts.&lt;/i&gt;" />
