  <title>From Father to Son (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (A Brother&#39;s Word, Book 2) - Janice Kay Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Is an independent cop the best family man?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Niall MacLachlan&#39;s one priority is the law. He fought his way from the wrong side of the tracks to earn his badge and won&#39;t jeopardize it for anything. After all, trusting his family nearly cost him everything as a kid. So, no. This loner has no desire for a wife and children to call his own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So why is his entirely too attractive landlady, Rowan Staley, slipping past all his defenses?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She and her young family–complete with noisy dog–are everything Niall thinks he doesn&#39;t want. But he can&#39;t keep his distance when she turns to him for protection from a neighborhood threat. And in the end, letting her go might be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
