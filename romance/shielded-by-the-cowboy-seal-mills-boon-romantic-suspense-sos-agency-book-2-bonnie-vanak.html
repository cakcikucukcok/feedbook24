          &lt;strong&gt; The SOS Agency grants one Navy SEAL his most personal mission yet…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Home on leave at his family farm, Navy SEAL Cooper Johnson receives an unexpected assignment: to protect a beautiful socialite on the run from her abusive ex. Grieving his kid sister, a brave cop killed in the line of duty due to a faulty bulletproof vest, Coop is in no mood for work—until he meets Meg Taylor. Soon, he finds that riding the land, lovely Meg safe beside him, is a surprising comfort to his heart. But when he discovers Meg&#39;s dark past—and the evidence she possesses that her ex would kill to keep buried—it will take both the cowboy and SEAL within him to get the ultimate justice.&lt;/p&gt;
