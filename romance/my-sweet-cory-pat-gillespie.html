  <title>My Sweet Cory - Pat Gillespie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Corys father, a local farmer, recruits the help of a family friends son, Max, to help plow his field, when rain was in the forecast that day. In doing so, there was a horrible accident involving a failed safety switch on the tractor that brought the blades down on Maxs leg, when trying to remove a clump of caked on mud. Seeing this, ignoring all signs of an oncoming heart attack, Bob ran out from his truck to try and save Maxs life. During which time, as Bobs heart was giving out, he stopped long enough to make Max promise to watch over Cory, knowing how she secretly loved him. &lt;p&gt;
But then, one night, after returning to New York, following her fathers funeral, napping on her sofa, the successful ghost story writer calls out to Max. Doing so, made one man enraged, when he nearly killed her in an attempt to take what she had been saving herself for. &lt;p&gt;
Now, as a former cop, Max has to strap on his weapon to protect Cory, when Ted Harden comes after her, and tries to kill her, to keep her from being with the one she really loves." />
