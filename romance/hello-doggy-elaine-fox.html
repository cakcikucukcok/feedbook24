  <title>Hello, Doggy! - Elaine Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Keenan James has made a career out of teaching women what men &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want. He hosts a weekly roundtable, where he offers advice to the love-lorn, and now he&#39;s even been tapped to write a book&amp;#8212;though he&#39;s never been able to commit to just one girl. Unfortunately, he&#39;s recently been saddled with his mom&#39;s irrepressible pooch, a golden doodle named Barbra Streisand, and his publisher has saddled him with a co-writer&amp;#8212;a shy psychologist named Tory Hoffstra, who&#39;s determined to keep him on a short leash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspecting that Keenan&#39;s nothing but a hound, Tory joins the round-table under an alias. She&#39;s shocked that he&#39;s more than just a smooth-talking seducer . . . and that he&#39;s even more gorgeous than she had heard. As for Keenan, before long he finds himself warming up to Barbra the dog and feeling the heat with Tory . . . and learning that not even his own advice could have prepared him for finally falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
