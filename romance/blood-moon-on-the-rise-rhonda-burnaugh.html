  <title>Blood Moon on the Rise - Rhonda Burnaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blood Moon on the Rise begins a year after Michaels death and finds the family scattered across the country. Joe and Anni have settled in San Francisco, where Joe is working as a counselor, while Anni opts to stay at home with their son. Living alone in Aspen, Seraphine continues to mourn the loss of her husband and is unable to get on with her life. Meanwhile, DJs life spirals out of control, finally landing him in the hospital. As DJ crashes, Seraphine decides she must leave Aspen and returns to California to be with her friends.
As the family comes together to support each other, a mysterious stranger named Gabriel de Vilbiss magically appears, threatening to complicate their lives. Sera is both mesmerized and mystified by this man. Torn between the memory of her beloved Michael and finding she is drawn to Gabriel, Sera is catapulted into emotional turmoil. DJ, Joe, and Anni are skeptical of this handsome new arrival and vow to uncover the truth about his identity and intentions. Is this gorgeous Adonis the answer to Seras future happiness, or is he a charlatan? Can they unravel the facts before Sera falls in love, or is it already too late? Will their quest for information provide the answers they are seeking or only dredge up more questions? 
A psychological thriller that provides the reader with many surprising twists as the story unfolds. Blood Moon on the Rise casts a spell of mystery, intrigue, and romance, leading them to discover deeply buried secrets about the past that will alter the course of all their lives forever." />
