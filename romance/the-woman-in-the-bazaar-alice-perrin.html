After a brief courtship they marry and move to India. Rafella is a devoted wife and George is glad to have her for a partner, but when she strikes up a friendship with Mr Kennard, a handsome barrister, George assumes the worst. In a fit of jealous rage, he terrorizes his young wife and she escapes into the night, never to be seen again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, when he is given another chance at love with the young, outgoing beauty Trixie Munro, George must face down his dark past. He must also contend with the &amp;lsquo;woman in the bazaar&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;an increasingly persistent and bloodcurdling rumour of an Englishwoman sold into slavery&amp;mdash;a horror he fears he might have wrought on his first wife.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compelling portrait of marriage and jealousy written in fluid prose,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Bazaar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is compulsively readable and one of the finest novels of the Raj era. Once a popular writer with many bestsellers to her credit, Alice Perrin is now being rediscovered for her memorable yarns of British life in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
