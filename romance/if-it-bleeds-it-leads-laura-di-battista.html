  <title>If It Bleeds, It Leads - Laura Di Battista</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1986 and sex is everywhere, even in the workplace. Cara Angeli has just landed her first full-time job working in a local newsroom. Although it is only an entry-level position, Cara is confident that hard work and diligence will help her achieve her dream of being a television reporter. Unfortunately, Cara does not realize the lengths she will have to go to in order to reach her goal.
As she begins her job as a production assistant in a newsroom full of lecherous bosses and motley co-workers, Cara soon discovers the television news business is not as glamorous as she once envisioned. Amid the shortcomings of a womanizing news director, an insecure anchorman, and colleagues determined to stop at nothing to get the lead story, Cara doggedly climbs an unsteady career ladder. As she attempts to balance her quest for true love with her desire for professional success, only time will tell if she will be able to attain everything she has ever wanted despite a violent act and a heartbreaking loss.
If It Bleeds, It Leads shares the compelling tale of a young womans journey through the cutthroat world of television news as she explores friendship, love, and the power of her own perseverance." />
