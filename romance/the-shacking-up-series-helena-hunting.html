  <title>The Shacking Up Series - Helena Hunting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three sexy, hilarious full-length &lt;i&gt;Shacking Up&lt;/i&gt; novels by&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Helena Hunting together in one convenient package for the first time!  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shacking Up&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ruby Scott is months behind on rent and can&#39;t seem to land a steady job. She has one chance to turn things around with a big audition. But instead of getting her big break, she gets sick as a dog and completely bombs it in the most humiliating fashion. All thanks to a mysterious, gorgeous guy who kissed--and then coughed on--her at a party the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, her best friend might have found the perfect opportunity; a job staying at the lavish penthouse apartment of hotel magnate Bancroft Mills while he&#39;s out of town, taking care of his exotic pets. But when the newly-evicted Ruby arrives to meet her new employer, it turns out Bane is the same guy who got her sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hooking Up&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amalie Whitfield is the picture of a blushing bride during her wedding reception-her husband can be heard, by Amalie and their guests, getting off with someone else. She has every reason to freak out, and in a moment of insanity, she throws herself at the first hot-blooded male she sees. But he&#39;s not interested in becoming her revenge screw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amalie decides to go on her honeymoon alone, only to find the man who rejected her also heading to the same tiny island for work. But this time he isn&#39;t holding back. They might agree that what happens on the island should stay on the island, but neither one can deny that their attraction is more than just physical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making Up&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cosy Felton is great at her job--so when the hottest guy she&#39;s ever seen walks into the shop looking completely overwhelmed, she&#39;s more than happy to turn on the charm and help him purchase all of the items on his list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin Mills is using his business trip in Las Vegas as a chance to escape the broken pieces of his life in New York City but pleasantly surprised when he finds himself attracted to the sales girl that helped him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As skeptical as Cosy may be of Griffin&#39;s motivations, there&#39;s something about him that intrigues her. But sometimes what happens in Vegas doesn&#39;t always stay in Vegas and when real life gets in the way, all bets are off.&lt;/p&gt;" />
