  <title>Western Romance: the Ultimate Outlaw - Britny Coker Hana Rass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She left home at nineteen to prove to her father, and other men, that she could do anything a man could do, and better. And she did. For three years, Skye-Blue Johnston has bounty hunted alongside her friend Clyde Daniels. She has brought in more outlaws than to be expected of a woman, and has made a living off it. Clyde and Blue (as she liked to be called) rode together until his death by an outlaw she and Clyde had been after. Blue had been devastated after his death, and took off on her own to the town of Silver City, Missouri.
He was the famed outlaw, the Robin Hood of Liberty, Missouri. And he had the most feared gang of the west. For many years, Jesse James and his gang has terrorized banks, stagecoaches, and trains in the surrounding states of Missouri as a lifestyle. He has known loss, and has become a hard man for it. Having met the bounty hunter of Silver City in the Calico Saloon, his (along with his brother, Frank&#39;s and his cousin, Cole&#39;s) life is about to change.
When these two forces meet, sparks fly and an electrifying bond is born. Throughout their obstacles, and meeting Billy the Kid and Johnny Ringo, they become inseparable. The outlaw and bounty hunter beat the odds that are against them and find out in the end that Love is the Ultimate Outlaw." />
