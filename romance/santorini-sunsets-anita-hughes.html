  <title>Santorini Sunsets - Anita Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brigit Palmer is thrilled to be on the Greek Island of Santorini. She&#39;s here for her wedding to Hollywood heart-throb Blake Crawford, one of America&#39;s most eligible bachelors. Brigit&#39;s parents have rented a villa, and soon guests will arrive from all over the world for the intimate ceremony.&lt;br&gt;Brigit is a New York socialite, and she&#39;s just given up her position at a Manhattan law firm to run her father&#39;s philanthropic foundation. Things are finally falling into place. Love, career, family. Everything is going so well...until she steps into the garden and sees her ex-husband Nathaniel hiding in the rose bushes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel, a failed novelist, announces that Blake sold the rights to the wedding to HELLO! Magazine for two million dollars (donated to charity), and he is the reporter assigned to write the story. Everyone expects Brigit to have her happily ever after, her mother who taught her how to lead the perfect lifestyle, her younger sister Daisy who impatiently wishes for her own love story, and of course her fiancée. Things are supposed to work out for them. But when Brigit discovers an unsettling secret about Blake, she questions everything she&#39;s ever believed about love, and wonders if she&#39;s not better off alone.&lt;br&gt;Told in Anita Hughes&#39; spectacularly descriptive prose, Santorini Sunsets is a story about family bonds, first loves, and the question of when to let go and when to hang on as tight as you can.&lt;/p&gt;" />
