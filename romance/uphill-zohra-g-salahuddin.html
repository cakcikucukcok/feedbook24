  <title>Uphill - Zohra G. Salahuddin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Karachi University students Jamil and Yusra are deeply in love. Each nobly bred and determined to achieve independence, the young Pakistanis hastily marry against their parents wishes and leave their future precariously hanging in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their journey together is not easy as the couple forgoes all luxuries, endures humiliation, and faces discrimination. As their challenges take a toll on their lives and threaten to unravel their relationship, Jamil and Yusra must deal with well-meaning but interfering relatives and nosy but benevolent neighbors as they attempt to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. With unflinching support from Jamils best friend and Yusras grandmother, the couple attempts to maneuver out of their marital mess. But as the future waits, even Jamil and Yusra are unsure if they can achieve the happily-ever-after they have always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the posh drawing rooms of Clifton to the modest dwellings in Gulshan Iqbal, Uphill is a riveting tale of love, friendship, sacrifice, and suffering as a young Pakistani couple fights for their marriage, peace, and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
