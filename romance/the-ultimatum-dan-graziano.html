  <title>The Ultimatum - Dan Graziano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Henry&#39;s got it good. He&#39;s a semi-successful, if not yet famous novelist. He&#39;s got a good job and good buds. Best of all, he&#39;s got Layla, his long-time, live-in lover, a fast-track associate at a New Jersey law firm. Henry loves Layla and she loves him. Life is a banquet, until . . . &lt;em&gt;The Ultimatum&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a week, Henry and Layla are off to Maine for a friend&#39;s wedding. And if Henry hasn&#39;t proposed marriage by the time the bride tosses the bouquet, Layla swears they&#39;re finished. For good. Henry thinks if it&#39;s not broke, don&#39;t fix it. But Layla needs proof of his love and devotion. And she&#39;s not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So who can he turn to for advice? Jake, his despondent divorced brother? His marriage-junkie golf friend, Big John? His outsized Peter Pan pal Pete, who simply &lt;em&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; grow up? Meanwhile Layla&#39;s got her two best girlfriends, tough-talking Gloria and sensitive Susan, giving helpful, contradictory advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is ticking away on the most important decision of Henry&#39;s life. But it&#39;ll take a mad, high-speed road trip and some bizarre behavior&amp;#8212;perhaps even an impromptu kidnapping&amp;#8212;to point him in the right, life-changing direction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
