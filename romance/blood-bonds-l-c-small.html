  <title>Blood Bonds - L. C. Small</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Serena sat at her desk, she placed her mug of black coffee on the cup holder. Without coffee, Serena was no good to anybody. She had always needed the caffeine kick in the morning. Looking through the appointment book, she noticed that she had a full day ahead of her, and through this, she gave a big sigh. If only something exciting would happen to her as it did in the novels. Then she realised that they were make believe and not real.&lt;br /&gt;Switching on the computer and just double-checking that all was in order on her desk, she got up to go to the toilet before she started her day. As she entered the staff toilets, she was greeted by her friend Abbie, who had been working there roughly the same time as Serena, and they had become good friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking good, Serena! Had a good weekend? asked Abbie in a welcoming voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the normal, went to hairdressers, had a colour and cut, saw my mom, and just lounged about. Really nothing out the norm, she said sounded disappointed. How about you? she asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing with me really. Just found out that my sister is expecting her first, so quite thrilled with that and you know still looking for a man, she said, smiling and laughing at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serena went into the cubicle, and, once she had finished, she went to wash her hands. Abbie had left the toilets and returned to her desk, leaving Serena all by herself. As she looked at herself, she noticed that she was looking quite presentable for a Monday morning in her grey trouser suit and black heels. Her dark brown hair was loose and fell on to her shoulders. She applied a little bit more gloss to her lips; she did not like wearing make-up as she liked her skin to breathe, and this was the best it got. Not bad, she said to herself. She left the toilets once she had washed her hands and made her way back to the office, thinking of the work load that was waiting for her that day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
