With the political tide turning, Lawrence feels it&#39;s his best shot--along with his charisma, solid twenty-nine year marriage, and three great kids. But a buried secret from his past is about to be resurrected..  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been eight years since Gabrielle Mercedes gave up her baby for adoption.
