  <title>Keeper - Robin Lovett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some men aren&#39;t meant to be found. They weren&#39;t made to get close to. Their homes are off-limits. Touching them is forbidden. Because breaking into the fortress of a man like that can obliterate him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always hunt the truth. Ever since my sister disappeared years ago, my insatiable need for answers is never satisfied. It&#39;s what I want most of all. More than men. More than sex. Being a journalist is the only thing that&#39;s been able to get me though each day. To help me survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finding Chase Vandershall will be my biggest challenge yet. They say he&#39;s unreachable. That a man who goes that high up into the mountains doesn&#39;t want to be found. But the hard part isn&#39;t getting to him. It&#39;s making sure I stay sane. Stay away from the power of his eyes and the strength in his hands. Remember who I am and what I came for...even as my desire for my captor swallows me whole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; **&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want this Layla woman gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only a desperate person would seek me out. And only a person with a death wish would actually make it. But this woman--this smoldering, sexy as hell woman--is unlike anyone I&#39;ve ever met, even before I holed myself up on top of this cold, lonely mountain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She&#39;s learning things about me I don&#39;t want her to know. Things that if the rest of society knew, would put me in prison and leave me there to rot. And even though she&#39;s forced her way into my solitary fortress, I can&#39;t let her expose me. Can&#39;t let her tell the world the dark details of my past she&#39;s uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the longer I keep her here, the more I don&#39;t want to let her go. And the more I don&#39;t want to let her go, the more she destroys me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stranger by Robin Lovett is a dark and intriguing story about the lengths one will go to find love. A page turner from the very beginning, this story makes you question, in the best of ways, what a romance is. A five star read!&quot; - &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Jenika Snow on &lt;i&gt;Stranger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wowza!
