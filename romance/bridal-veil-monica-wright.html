  <title>Bridal Veil - Monica Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charly Ellington should be proud to wear her great-great-great-grandmothers wedding dress. Instead, the bodice is too tight, the skirt is too loose, and the dress comes with a century of expectations attached to it. As the daughter of the democratic presidential nominee, Charly is marrying Americas most eligible future senator to help her father get elected. But there is only one problem: Charly does not love Trenton Foxworth III. Worse yet, Charly wishes she was the one running for office.
Even though Charly knows she is the first to break the family history of fairy-tale love matches, she dutifully dons a period costume and prepares for her rehearsal dinner and her new life as a senators wife. But after a distressed Charly suddenly sees her great-great-great grandmothers reflection in her mirror, she touches the glass and falls through to face Charlotte Foster in the year 1885. Shockingly, Charly discovers Charlotte is not living the fairy tale she knows so well. Now in a different time and place, Charly must try to set her family history rightall while one man finally shows her what it is like to be loved for who she is, not her political connections. 
In this historical romance, a woman who finds herself on a voyage of self-discovery learns what love can be while facing a decision with the potential to change her destiny forever." />
