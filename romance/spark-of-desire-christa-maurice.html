Kevin offers her the opportunity to make her dream a reality, but both are unprepared for the flames of desire their meeting ignites. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But what&#39;s with Kevin? He flirts with her, then pushes her away. Not that she needs the complication of starting a new job with a reputation anyway. Jessica decides she&#39;ll just concentrate on her training instead of the dreamy guy who can&#39;t make up his mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Friends complicate the matter even further, wreaking havoc on Jessica&#39;s plans to stay focused solely on her goal. As Jessica&#39;s tests approach, she and Kevin must come to terms with their burgeoning love for each other. Will circumstances snuff their chances for happiness? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; WARNING: Light BDSM, kink, explicit sex&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;69,732 Words" />
