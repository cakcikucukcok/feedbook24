  <title>The Guppy and the Shark - J</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Barbara Wilson is a widow and owner of the Double-T Bar Ranch in Montana living comfortably with her daughter and two loving grandchildren. The demands of running a ranch and maintaining her reputation keep her occupied, but she longs for something more.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mike Watson is a retired widower living alone in northern Illinois. Trapped by his grief and hopelessness since his wife died of cancer, he has chosen to avoid social interactions, which worries his grown children. One day while tinkering with his van, the answer comes to him: he decides then and there to write a book and set it in the West.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mike takes a life-changing trip from home to the wilds of Montana to do research for the book and meet the locals. There, a chance encounter with Barbara changes both of their lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When the lives of these two wounded strangers suddenly align, a book project, a picnic, a storm, a rock, and secrets form the elements that bring them together. Their two families must now learn to overcome disappointment and the many obstacles that circumstance places in the path to hope.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For two lost souls in the process of healing broken hearts, nothing is sweeter than the hope of new love.&lt;/P&gt;" />
