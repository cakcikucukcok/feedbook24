  <title>Fake Engagement, Real Temptation - Joya Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Oh. My. God. Carrie Morgan can&#39;t escape her cheating ex fiancé. She goes on her Hawaiian honeymoon fantasy vacation to prove she&#39;s over him--but he&#39;s there with his mistress in tow. Good thing Carrie&#39;s annoyingly over-protective friend Blake came with her. How&#39;s she going to prove to her ex she&#39;s over him? Easy. One... Two... Three... She grabs Blake and kisses him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blake Harris isn&#39;t about to let anyone take advantage of his heartbroken friend Carrie. And that includes himself, even if she&#39;s sexy as sin in that bikini. Then she kisses him--and he&#39;s on fire. Damage done, but he can back off. Except he sees that broken look in Carrie&#39;s eyes. No. Hell no. New plan. He intends to show her ex just what he&#39;s thrown away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The kisses? For show. The heat? Part of the performance. The private practice sessions? Uh-oh. Those are starting to feel a bit too real...&lt;/p&gt;" />
