  <title>Sasebo - Mack Samples</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Sasebo&lt;/I&gt; is the story of young Mason McCabe, an enlisted sailor whose leisurely tour of duty at the U.S. Naval Base in Sasebo, Japan during the 1950&#39;s is turned upside down when he comes face to face with the realities of the Cold War. His work with classified documents brings an offer from a communist undercover organization, headed by a Nisei with a grudge against America, to buy military secrets. Mason shrugs off the early offers, but his work as a courier of top secret documents eventually gets him into a situation where he is fighting for his very life on a mountain outside Sasebo. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During the course of his tour he also becomes involved in a swing band comprised of both Japanese and Americans. The band experience brings him into contact with Laura Robbins, a beautiful young officer&#39;s wife. Even though he knows that a relationship with her could have tragic consequences, he is unable to fend off the temptation. His involvement with a Japanese bar girl further complicates the situation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mason MaCabe&#39;s adventures reveal what life was like for young servicemen in the Far East during the 1950&#39;s when America had all the money and the Seventh Fleet was the &quot;Bull of the Pacific.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;" />
