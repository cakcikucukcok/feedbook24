  <title>Arrogant Bastard - Zara Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;An exotically filthy, devastatingly beautiful story that will captivate and tease you long after the book is finished.&quot; -- Audrey Carlan, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author on &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Liar&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  I&#39;m known as the Black Widow because the desires I hide inside are pure poison. I was a different person once. Faith, a young wife, hoping to become a mother. My life was pleasant. Stable. It was hell. Until Killian Knight opened my eyes to a world of espionage and intrigue. He saw something in me, something I was too afraid to acknowledge. I didn&#39;t want to be excited by the danger. Didn&#39;t want to crave the wicked passion only he could provide. But I did want, so now I run. And I pay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  I never meant to corrupt her, but I&#39;m not sorry.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After all, I&#39;m already damned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After four years of searching and longing, I&#39;ve finally found her. Faith, the one person in the world I breathe for. She lives beneath my skin as surely as I wear proof of our transgressions inked on my body. And like the forbidden fruit that doomed us from the beginning, our end is inevitable. We lived with no regret. We loved without inhibition. We betrayed those closest to us. We killed for that love. Now...we will burn in hell together." />
