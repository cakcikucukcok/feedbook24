  <title>The Hofer family - Mr. Rosolino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are places in this life that are not made of tuff and concrete and that exist only in those hearts full of hope. The young Michael Hofer knew well that he only wanted to play with his peers, study in a public school, explore the streets of his native country, but above all, grow up as a normal person.&lt;br /&gt;
What did he ask for so much detail? Nothing for one of his age. Yet, in the most luxurious villa in Bressanone, in the province of Bolzano, the Hofer family forged the young Michael to make him a special boy and, even before his face was shown in public, the name Michael Hofer had already become legend.&lt;br /&gt;
Would fame have been enough to restore Michael lost childhood? Could success have restored his lost years in his youth?&lt;br /&gt;
But the day the doors of that prison would open was about to come." />
