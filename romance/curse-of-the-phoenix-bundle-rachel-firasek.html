  <title>Curse of the Phoenix Bundle - Rachel Firasek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book One: The Last Rising&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After paying two millennia&#39;s penance to Osiris, world-weary Phoenix Ice has had enough. Saving souls without any hope for her own redemption isn&#39;t how she imagined spending eternity. Fed up, she decides her next death will be her last. But when she sacrifices her own life for a sexy Texan in a catastrophic plane crash, she has no idea the consequences will be so great...or that she&#39;ll end up back in his life for her next assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Turner Alcott has survived the worst, finding a wife and mother for his son matters more than ever before. When the mysterious Ice comes into his life, Turner knows she&#39;s the one--but love is the last thing Ice wants. If he wants to win her heart, Turner must teach Ice how to forgive herself, and prove that love is the ultimate sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Two: The Last Awakening &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three hundred years, Arabella&#39;s life has been one meaningless death after another. In a cruel twist of fate, Osiris gifts the phoenix her mortality and long-gone voodoo magic with a warning that she must save her next soul within a week without using magic, or she&#39;ll lose her power forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex-soldier Greyson Meadows desperately wants to be freed from the nightmares and guilt that haunt him. Confronted by a waif of a woman who forces him to face the truth about his past, he runs fast and hard, fighting the need to prove himself worthy despite his perceived failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ari becomes the target of her own magical blunder, the weak will find strength and the strong will fall. One will have to give up everything so the other can have peace, but will love&#39;s magic withstand the loss? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Three: The Last Beginning &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she&#39;s always hated being a phoenix, Sadie has to admit immortality has its advantages. She&#39;s seen and done more in the last 150 years than she&#39;d ever dreamed of, but she can&#39;t get past the fact that Osiris has done nothing but manipulate her and her fellow phoenixes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or that, when her last incarnation as a phoenix comes to a fiery end, the fire slowly begins to consume her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun god Osiris is ashamed of his role as ruler of the Underworld, but he unless he can figure out how to save Sadie, that&#39;s exactly where she&#39;s going to end up. Permanently. Terrified he&#39;s going to lose her, he takes her on a hunt for The Book of the Dead, which is the only way he knows he can save her--even if it means she&#39;ll hate him forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
