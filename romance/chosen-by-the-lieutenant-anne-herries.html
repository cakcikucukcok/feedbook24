  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Chosen by the Lieutenant - Anne Herries</i></b> | Chosen by the Lieutenant had a nice premise, but I never empathized with the characters' feelings or became invested in the relationship between Amanda and Phipps. I think the problem lies with Anne Herries' detached style; there's a marked tendency to tell the audience that Miss Hamilton despaired or Phipps realized that he knew far less about his intended than he'd assumed.<br /><b><i>Chosen by the Lieutenant by Anne Herries</i></b> | Chosen By The Lieutenant (Mills &amp; Boon Regency) [Herries, Anne] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers. Chosen By The Lieutenant (Mills &amp; Boon Regency)<br /><b><i>Chosen By The Lieutenant (Mills &amp; Boon Regency): Herries ...</i></b> | Chosen by the Lieutenant is what I regard as a typical Anne Herries book. It's okay. She always has a relatively good plot, her principal characters are likeable and I'm sure she's probably much more in tune with how young Regency men and women of their class behaved and spoke than many more 'emotional' writers.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Chosen by the Lieutenant - Anne Herries</a> </h3></p><hr/>
