  <title>Forever Today - Breck Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It begins with a sealed envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chad Breckinridge is a successful attorney who is pushing fifty and is trying to find some sense in his life. After a heartwrenching tragedy, he begins to look back on his existence from his days in high school as a football star and all around popular guy, to his time fighting in the jungles of Vietnam, the hazing, party life of college, and later the struggles of marriage, fatherhood and finally having to grow up and be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy who lived most of his life, in the moment must now reflect back on it all to draw a picture of a life most profound. For all the zany adventures, and good times, and life changing events that Chad has been part of, true love was always just out of reach. Chad must come to grips with himself and discover HIS true meaning, and then, and only then, can he open the sealed envelope and find out what it all means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chads story is a story of life and of love. And as always, its not the destination that matters, but the journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
