  <title>The Ransomes: Matt, Nick and Katherine (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Sara Orwig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;PREGNANT WITH THE FIRST HEIR&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Olivia Brennan lets Matt Ransome drag her to his ranch on one condition: that he marry her and be a father to her child. But the heat between them makes ‘marriage in name only’ much easier said than done!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;REVENGE OF THE SECOND SON&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Millionaire Nick Ransome is after Julia Holcomb’s business. One steamy weekend later, Julia’s in trouble! Because Nick won’t walk away without getting what he wants. And what he wants… is her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SCANDALS FROM THE THIRD BRIDE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After Cade Logan jilted her, Katherine Ransome didn’t expect to see him again – until he bid half a million dollars for one evening with her! Cade’s betrayal had destroyed her… but could she resist him now he’d returned?&lt;/p&gt;
