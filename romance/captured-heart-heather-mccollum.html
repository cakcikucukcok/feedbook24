  <title>Captured Heart - Heather McCollum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fleeing with only her bow, horse, enormous pet wolf, and the cryptic clues hidden in her mother&#39;s medicine journal, healer Meg Boswell gallops north towards freedom, running from the man who falsely accused her mother of witchcraft. Cursed with magical healing abilities, Meg knows that if she&#39;s captured, she will die like her mother--atop a blazing witch&#39;s pyre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter winds rip across the Highlands, pressing Chief Caden Macbain forward in his desperate plan to save his clan. He&#39;s not above using an innocent woman to bargain for peace if it keeps his clan from starving. But Meg isn&#39;t who Caden thinks she is, and when she kills a man to save the clan, he must choose between duty and her life. For although he captured her to force a peace, Meg&#39;s strength and courage have captured Caden&#39;s heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Highland Hearts series can be read out of order, but is best enjoyed in order. &lt;br&gt;Highland Hearts reading order: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 Captured Heart   &lt;br&gt;#2 Tangled Hearts&lt;br&gt;#3 Untamed Hearts      &lt;br&gt;#4 Crimson Heart     &lt;br&gt;#5 Highland Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
