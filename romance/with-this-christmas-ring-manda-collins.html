  <title>With This Christmas Ring - Manda Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wallflower determined to fulfill a dying promise, the rogue she jilted years ago, and an orphaned baby are all brought together amidst the magic of Christmas in this new novella from Manda Collins. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miss Merry Parks makes a deathbed promise to a schoolfriend that her infant daughter will be taken to her absent father. There&#39;s only one problem--to find the baby&#39;s father, she&#39;ll have to consult his cousin, Viscount Wrotham, the man she jilted five years ago. The man she couldn&#39;t forget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Ponsonby, Viscount Wrotham, is stunned to find Merry Parks--looking more lovely than ever--on his doorstep with an infant in her arms. His shock soon turns to dismay when he learns his own cousin William is the man who abandoned his wife and child. As head of the family he&#39;s duty bound to see right is done. But he can&#39;t let this opportunity pass. He&#39;ll take Merry and the baby to his cousin, but he&#39;ll woo her back in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merry agrees to travel with Alex and the baby to Wrotham Castle, where the entire Ponsonby family has gathered for Christmas, but her plans to see the baby settled then leave are ruined by a snowstorm. After five years apart, Alex and Merry will spend the week getting reacquainted. Perhaps it&#39;s the spirit of the holiday, or the magic of the season, but there could be something else in the air this Yuletide...A Christmas Reunion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
