  <title>Rescued by a Ranger (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (Hill Country Heroes, Book 3) - Tanya Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She&#39;s Running From The Law…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alexandra Hunt is living a lie. In fact, that&#39;s not even her real name. But after the death of her estranged husband, Alex and her four-year-old daughter were at the mercy of ruthless people: her powerful, possibly crooked former in-laws. When they came after her child, Alex saw no choice but to flee.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Small town Fredericksburg, Texas, offers unexpected sanctuary. Until she meets her next-door neighbor, by-the-book—and devilishly handsome—Texas Ranger Zane Winchester! Single father Zane has to admit he has a thing for sweet, pretty Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet while the attraction is mutual, she&#39;s definitely hiding something. And Zane can&#39;t abide a liar. He needs to find out Alex&#39;s secrets before he can truly allow her into his and his teenage daughter&#39;s lives. But when he discovers the truth, will he help Alex—or turn her in?&lt;/p&gt;
