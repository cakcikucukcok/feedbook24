  <title>Blame It on Chocolate (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Jennifer Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Lucy Fitzhenry didn&#39;t just wake up one morning and decide to do something stupid…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when an experimental strain of chocolate that she&#39;d developed needed testing, someone had to do it. Who knew that overindulging in her creation would turn an introverted plant lover into a wild nymphomaniac? Or that a celebration with Nick, her boss, would lead to a shocking kiss…and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She blamed it on the chocolate. Her new discovery was supposed to have made her career. Not turn her practical, logical, normal life upside down and get her pregnant with her boss&#39;s baby! Though she and Nick butted heads at work, if their one night together was any indication, they were a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; match in bed. With a little luck (and chocolate!) maybe they could turn their one-night stand into the chance of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
