  <title>Falling For London - L.J. Diva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tamara Cainer has done it! She&amp;#39;s had her book picked up by a UK publisher and is on her way to a ten-day stay in London, England.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arriving in London and overwhelmed by the sights and sounds, Tamara soon finds herself in the middle of a sticky situation. After meeting the Son of God, the gorgeous Sgt Callum Stone, and falling hook, line and sinker, she&amp;rsquo;s taken into the murky depths of the river Thames by a woman trying to commit suicide &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; homicide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tamara&amp;rsquo;s injuries are so horrific her pain-filled, pill-popping days start, and saving her life for the second time, Callum realises he&amp;rsquo;s fallen for her too. Declaring his love, he takes her away to heal and deal with her issues, but new dreams plague her. Dreams of a big white spiky thing that means something &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; is going to happen. And when she sees it across the river from the club every celebrity in Britain is celebrating New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve at, she finally remembers what it means. BIG Trouble!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trouble so big it sends her flying into the Thames and puts her back into the hospital for the second time. And then along comes trouble in the form of an up and coming actor singer who&amp;rsquo;s telling &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; tall tales about the passionate affair he and Tamara are having all over Europe&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can Tamara deal with the mess she&amp;rsquo;s in the middle of and get her life back together in time for her and Callum to fall for each other all over again?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
