  <title>Drive Me Crazy - Tracy Wolff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Former rivals Quinn Bradford and Elise McKinney are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; friends, at least not anymore. In the past all they cared about was psyching each other out before concerts... until everything changed. But when Quinn--now the keyboardist for Shaken Dirty, the hottest rock band on the scene--returns to his hometown and hears about the car accident that shattered Elise&#39;s career, he&#39;s determined to make things right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elise makes it perfectly clear she wants nothing to do with an arrogant rock star, despite how bad she so clearly wants him. So Quinn hatches a plan that&#39;ll keep the stubborn world class pianist under his care...and maybe in his bed. 1 week together in his house, no chance of escape. But amid pranks both childish and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; adult, their secrets come rearing back to haunt them. And it might be more than either of them can forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Shaken Dirty series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Crash Into Me&lt;br&gt;* Drive Me Crazy&lt;br&gt;* Fade Into You&lt;/p&gt;" />
