  <title>A Study in Scoundrels - Christy Carlyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sophia Ruthven is the epitome of proper behavior. On paper at least, as long as that paper isn&amp;#8217;t from one of the lady detective stories she secretly pens. She certainly isn&amp;#8217;t interested in associating with the dashing Jasper Grey, the wayward heir to the Earl of Stanhope, and one of the stage&amp;#8217;s leading men. But when she learns Grey&amp;#8217;s younger sister Liddy has gone missing, she can&amp;#8217;t deny her desire to solve the mystery&amp;#8230;or her attraction to the incorrigible scoundrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsibility isn&amp;#8217;t something Grey is very familiar with. On the boards and in the bedroom, he lives exactly how he wants to, shunning all the trappings of respectability and society. Grey knows he should avoid the bewitching Sophia, but he&amp;#8217;s never been able to say no to what he wants. And having Sophia in his arms and his bed is quickly becoming the thing he wants the most.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Sophia and Grey&amp;#8217;s search for Liddy continues across the English countryside, can this scoundrel convince a proper lady that he&amp;#8217;s actually perfect for her or will their adventure leave them both heartbroken?&lt;/p&gt;" />
