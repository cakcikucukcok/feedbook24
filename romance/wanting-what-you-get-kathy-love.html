  <title>Wanting What You Get - Kathy Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In her delightful novel, &lt;i&gt;Getting What You Want,&lt;/i&gt; Kathy Love introduced the Stepp sisters, three unique women with wildly different ideas about love and life. Now, meet Ellie, the romantic middle sister who&#39;s about to take a chance on having what she&#39;s always wanted.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Can&#39;t Be Happening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is he flirting with me? I must be imagining things. Why would Mason Sweet, the gorgeous mayor of Millbrook, Maine, the man I&#39;ve secretly been in love with since seventh grade, flirt with me? He&#39;s the town golden boy, and I&#39;m, well, the local librarian. The Stepp sister who stayed close to home. The one who bakes brownies.  .  .then eats them all. My thighs make that whick-whick-whick sound in pantyhose. He can&#39;t possibly be flirting with me. So why is he giving me that melt-you-where-you-stand look? Why is he pulling me close? And what is he whispering in my ear.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry, could you repeat that? Now I&#39;m hearing things, because I swear Mason just asked me if I&#39;d like to.  .  .well, he wasn&#39;t asking for a book recommendation, let&#39;s put it that way. Oh my, my, my. Okay, Ellie, stop blushing like a teenaged girl. I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t mean it. Maybe I should just alphabetize something. Be the good girl everyone expects. Eat another brownie. Forget this ever happened. &lt;br&gt;So why is it I can&#39;t stop myself from saying, &quot;Yes.  .  ..&quot;" />
