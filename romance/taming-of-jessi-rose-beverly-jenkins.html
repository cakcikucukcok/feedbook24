  <title>Taming of Jessi Rose - Beverly Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No Man Could Tame Her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessi Rose Clayton would do anything to keep the family ranch from falling into the wrong hands-even agree to take on a rough-and-tumble outlaw as her protector. With his rugged, handsome face and muscular bronze body, Griffin Blake can draw a sigh from a lady&#39;s lips almost as fast as his strong, sculpted arm can draw a gun from its holster. But Jessi Rose has no intentions of falling for his charms. No, her relationship with him is strictly business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until He Came Along&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robbing the railroad is Griffin Blake&#39;s game, but he has no choice. Either he agrees to help Jessi Rose or he gets sent back to jail-so he arrives at the ranch ready to help the ornery female protect her land. But underneath Jessi&#39;s all-business exterior is a femininity she&#39;s kept hidden for far too long-making Griffin think it might be time to tame this wild Texas rose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
