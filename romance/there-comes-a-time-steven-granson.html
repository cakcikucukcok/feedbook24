  <title>There Comes a Time - Steven Granson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;South Florida 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories, after all&#39;s said and done, that&#39;s what you&#39;re left with. When you&#39;ve outlived your friends, and your child has moved on to make his own memories, and your body is no longer what it once was, and the limitless tomorrows have given way to only a few yet unused ones, and all that remains is a mountain of yesterdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there&#39;s little to do but look back and ache for what was or could have been and your every day is filled with these memories and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night now that I don&#39;t sleep I watch the clock&#39;s seconds slowly turn into minutes and then drag on before moving to the next hour. Now as I wait to join all those I once knew, I am ready.&lt;/p&gt;" />
