  <title>Just Like a Man - Elizabeth Bevarly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hannah Frost is used to being surrounded by cute, sweet, troublemakers. After all, she&#39;s the principle of Indiana&#39;s upper class private elementary school, a popular repository for kids who &quot;don&#39;t fit in&quot; at public school. But even though she&#39;s been single since dinosaurs roamed the earth, what is interesting Hannah these days isn&#39;t her worst student&amp;#14313;t&#39;s his father, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What she can put her fingers on? Michael Sawyer, aka Raptor, former FBI computer specialist, has a few good ideas. Trouble is, he&#39;s too busy trying to save the world&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;or at least the world&#39;s internet connections&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;from certain doom at the hands of an old enemy, and trying to get his imaginative son back on course at school. But there&#39;s always time for a gorgeous, oh&amp;ndash;so&amp;ndash;prim, slightly mysterious headmistress, isn&#39;t there? Michael plans to make time, and do whatever it takes to convince Hannah to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;" />
