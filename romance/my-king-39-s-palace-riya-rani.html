  <title>My King&#39;s Palace - Riya, Rani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a collection of short stories by a mother-and-daughter duo. The mother, when she was a kid, used to spend her childhood evenings sitting under the window cornice, reading Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray. Then when she grows up, she gets acquainted with Rituparno, a storyteller par excellence. Then she has a beautiful baby girl. However, like most in our times, she had to manage both home and office. Her work required her to travel, and it took her across the world. Every time she had to travel away from her daughter, she used to feel this irrational pang of pain that she could not fathom. Over time, she learns to shut out her pain by thinking of stories every time she travelled away from her daughter. The little daughter also grows up and misses her mother while she is away. The mother decides to share some of her stories with her teenage daughter. While reading those stories together, they realize that even though they have been apart many a times, they have connected through an invisible bond of stories. This book is a collection of some such stories collated on a lazy Sunday afternoon." />
