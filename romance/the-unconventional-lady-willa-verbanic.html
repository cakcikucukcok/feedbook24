  <title>The Unconventional Lady - Willa Verbanic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Judys profession of architecture was predominately a male 
profession,
and her desire to work in foreign countries was especially hard. 
It had
been a struggle but she had recently been hired to work on a 
job of a
lifetime.&lt;br&gt;
The hope to work on a project in the depth of the Brazilian rain 
forest
seemed to be in her reach, until she met the Engineer in 
charge. He
was determine Judy was not going to stay.&lt;p&gt;
Judy had not got where she was without a fight, so there is 
dissension,
excitement and an interesting challenge from the beginning. 
Who
would win? Judy knew she was a good Architect and could 
handle the
project, the owner of the company was assured she could as 
well, all
she had to do was prove it to Ben.&lt;p&gt;
I have lived most of my life in California but traveled
extensively. I have used my travel experience as well
as my personal observation of the people around
me as a base for the characters and settings in my
book. I am an avid reader of a wide selection of
subject matter. I enjoy a good romance, a mystery
or a historical novel.&lt;p&gt;
I have two children, one who lives on the East Coast one on 
the West
Coast and I visit both regularly, usually driving between the two 
and
enjoying sights on the way.&lt;p&gt;" />
