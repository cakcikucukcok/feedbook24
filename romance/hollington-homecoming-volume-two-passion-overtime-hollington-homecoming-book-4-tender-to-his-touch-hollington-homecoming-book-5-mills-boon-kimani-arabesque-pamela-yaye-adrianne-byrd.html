          &lt;strong&gt;TENDER TO HIS TOUCH&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hollington Homecoming Queen Beverly Turner is pulling out all the stops for her ten-year reunion. The trendy designer&#39;s first order of business is to let loose and have some fun. And her wish just might come true when she meets Lucius Gray. The hunky, high-powered Atlanta attorney is looking for the same thing she is: a sexy fling with no strings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lucius needs a time-out from his workaholic life, and the chic, sensual designer more than fits the bill. Like Beverly, the single father has been burned by love. But Beverly is arousing feelings that are making him long to turn their sizzling affair into a lifetime of passion. If she&#39;ll let him, he&#39;ll give her the happy ending she deserves and prove to this unforgettable woman that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; life–and love–after college….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;PASSION OVERTIME&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the homecoming festivities heating up, the last thing Kyra Dixon needs is an unwelcome blast from the past. But the PR rep has been given the plum job of helping sign hunky pro-football star Terrence Franklin as Hollington&#39;s new head coach.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kyra knows the sexy sports star…intimately. They were once engaged–until Terrence dumped her to chase dreams of glory (and groupies). Now he&#39;s back in her life–as irresistible as ever. And Kyra and Terrence have some unfinished business: the passion that&#39;s raging hotter than ever between them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After ten years of playing the field, Terrence is finally ready to settle down. Only one woman fits his fantasies of domestic bliss, but Kyra may not be ready to forgive and forget. All Terrence wants is a second chance to convince Kyra that as long as they&#39;re together, neither of them will &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; lose.&lt;/p&gt;
