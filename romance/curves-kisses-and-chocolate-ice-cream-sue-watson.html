  <title>Curves, Kisses and Chocolate Ice-Cream - Sue Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Dani&amp;#x2019;s on a mission to get her life back on track by the end of the summer. Running, rowing, aerobics and more, but perhaps all she needs are sweet treats and a second chance?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, &lt;b&gt;Dani&lt;/b&gt; fled Appledore with a broken-heart and a suitcase full of shattered dreams. Only now is she brave enough to put her past behind her and return for a summer selling homemade ice cream and getting fit by doing sit-ups by the sea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the new-look cafe is filled with old memories of &lt;b&gt;Jude&lt;/b&gt;, her teenage sweetheart-turned-sour. She thinks of him every time she swirls warm sauce onto a &amp;#x2018;chocolate-bockaglory&amp;#x2019; and even with the help of &lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt;, her gorgeous personal trainer, the urge to break her diet is everywhere she turns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jude makes an appearance at the cafe on the eve of Dani&amp;#x2019;s birthday party, history threatens to repeat itself. &lt;b&gt;Is Dani strong enough to say no? And is the love she&amp;#x2019;s been longing for much closer than she thinks?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly delicious, laugh-out-loud beach read that&amp;#x2019;s guaranteed to melt your heart. Perfect for fans of &lt;b&gt;Lucy Diamond, Abby Clements and Debbie Johnson&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;Curves, Kisses and Chocolate Ice-Cream&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Without a doubt, my new favourite book by Sue Watson&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#x2013; it&amp;#x2019;s fabulous, it&amp;#x2019;s funny, its full of ice-cream, its full of all around goodness, wrapped into one fantabulous story! &lt;b&gt;I can&#39;t express how satisfying and enjoyable I found every second of this wonderfully entertaining story&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Rachel&amp;#x2019;s Random Reads&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;This is such a &lt;b&gt;truly wonderful book&lt;/b&gt;.
