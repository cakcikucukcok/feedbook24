      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is not going well for archaeologist Sam Bellamy. She&#39;s stuck in the middle of the ocean on a salvage boat with people who want her dead. It wasn&#39;t her gift for being able to sense objects of power that got her here, rather her need to make a secret society called the Knights of the Dragon pay for killing her mentor. Sam doesn&#39;t believe in dragons, but the Knights do, and if she can get one of the sacred artifacts they&#39;re searching for away from them, she&#39;ll consider it payback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezra Easton is content to run his marine salvage company and live alone on his private island.
