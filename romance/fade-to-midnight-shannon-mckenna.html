  <title>Fade To Midnight - Shannon McKenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gone But Not Forgotten&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Davy.  .  .Connor.  .  .Sean.  .  . Three brothers who have conquered their demons, but they&#39;ve never forgotten their long lost brother, Kev, whom they believed to be dead. When the McCloud brothers discover Kev is alive, they won&#39;t rest until they find him.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beaten and tortured almost to death, Kev Larsen was found eighteen years earlier in a warehouse alley. He survived his brutal ordeal, but his memories before that night were completely erased. When he nearly dies from trying to save someone from drowning, the brain surgery he has to save his life triggers fragmented, terrifying memories. With only these memories and the name of his torturer to guide him, Kev is determined to unlock the secrets to his past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edie Parrish has always been good at not letting anyone get too close to her. If someone were to learn of her unusual gift, her life would be immediately jeopardized. But when Kev Larsen discovers who she really is, Edie has only one choice: to trust him. And soon, Edie can&#39;t resist her consuming desire for him--even though she knows she&#39;ll have to pay a price for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Kev and Edie must race against time and place their faith in each other to stop a deadly legacy.  .  ." />
