  <title>Fair Game - Taylor Keating</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Video-game designer River Weston has seen her world torn apart. The streets of Earth have filled with looting, sickness, and fighting, but River knows that she is in a unique position to help. Drawing on her Fae magic, she creates a computer-generated program called Hollow Man, designed to protect humans during battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worlds away, Guardian Chase Hawkins has finally returned to his own body after years of astral projection. His mission now that he&#39;s back: retrieve River, who is walking a dark path without even knowing it, and strip her world of the technology that has brought it to ruin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawk and his team arrive on Earth only to discover that River&#39;s new computer program endangers the world all on its own. An old human virus has resurrected and mutated with a computer virus inside of Hollow Man, and it&#39;s spreading uncontrollably. Hawk is convinced it&#39;s too late to save Earth...but River isn&#39;t ready to give up hope yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;River and Hawk find themselves on opposing sides, yet drawn together stronger than ever before. But a future with both of them in it could mean walking paths darker than either of them could ever have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
