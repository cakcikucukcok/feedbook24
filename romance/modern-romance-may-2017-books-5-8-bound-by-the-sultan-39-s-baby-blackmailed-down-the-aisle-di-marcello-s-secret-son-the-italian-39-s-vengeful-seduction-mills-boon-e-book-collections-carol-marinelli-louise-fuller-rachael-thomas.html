  <title>Modern Romance May 2017 Books 5 - 8: Bound by the Sultan&#39;s Baby / Blackmailed Down the Aisle / Di Marcelloâ€™s Secret Son / The Italian&#39;s Vengeful Seduction (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Carol Marinelli, Louise Fuller, Rachael Thomas, Bella Frances</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Four of the newest modern romances in one place!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bound by the Sultan’s Baby&lt;/em&gt; by Carol Marinelli&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A scandalous royal consequence!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One night with innocent wedding planner Gabi was not enough for Sultan Alim al-Lehan, but duty called him home. Memories of their forbidden pleasure prove impossible to forget–especially when he discovers Gabi has just returned from maternity leave!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The baby must be his, but if Gabi won&#39;t tell him, Alim will seduce the truth out of her! Commanding that she arrange his wedding, even if he&#39;s not yet picked a wife, is the ideal ruse. Alim wants her in his bed, but must decide–as a sultan&#39;s mistress or bride!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackmailed Down the Aisle&lt;/em&gt; by Louise Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;What&#39;s it to be–me, or the police?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Out-of-work actress Daisy Maddox would do anything for her brother–even sneak into a sleek New York office to return the watch he stole from billionaire Rollo Fleming.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Rollo catches her red-handed, Daisy is completely at his mercy. But Rollo needs a wife to seal a deal, and events take a wild turn–he demands Daisy become his temporary wife!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Swept into Rollo&#39;s world, Daisy&#39;s caught in an intense tangle of emotions. And with every searing kiss, Daisy&#39;s guard melts, as she discovers there are unexpected, pleasurable advantages to being blackmailed down the aisle…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Di Marcello’s Secret Son&lt;/em&gt; by Rachael Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The challenge: to leave your billionaire lifestyle behind for two weeks…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Italian tycoon Antonio Di Marcello relishes a challenge–but running into Sadie Parker while undercover as a mechanic rocks him to the core. Four years after their fevered fling stripped away his iron guard, he&#39;s confronted with the shocking consequences…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sadie gave up hope on her desperate attempts to contact Antonio. Now she has to face the day she&#39;s both dreaded and longed for! Yet Antonio&#39;s claim over her and her son is hard to resist–especially because he&#39;ll use a sensual onslaught to get what he wants!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Italian’s Vengeful Seduction&lt;/em&gt; by Bella Francis&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His tantalizing revenge!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tycoon Marco Borsatto gave Stacey Jackson her first taste of pleasure…only to devastate her with accusations of treachery. Ever since, waitress Stacey has buried any hint of vulnerability behind a cool facade–she refuses to open herself up to hurt again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except Marco isn&#39;t a man to forgive and forget! When he rescues Stacey from another man, one look at Stacey&#39;s luscious form is enough to remind him of her bitter betrayal–and their electrifying magnetism!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marco won&#39;t allow Stacey to slip through his fingers again: his touch will be his vengeance!&lt;/p&gt;
