  <title>The Impostor - Celeste Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It isn&#39;t easy moving about Society dressed like a dandy-especially when one is a ruthless spy. But that&#39;s precisely the latest mission for Liar&#39;s Club agent Dalton Montmorecy. Dalton is posing as Sir Thorogood, the elusive cartoonist whose scathing political caricatures have all of London abuzz. The true identity of Sir Thorogood is a mystery, and Dalton hopes that impersonating him will flush out the real menace before his cartoons do further damage to the Crown. Now, if Dalton could only find a way to get the irksome, yet oddly appealing widow, Clara Simpson, off his trail... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Clara meets Sir Thorogood at a ball, she&#39;s certain he is an impostor-because she&#39;s the true Sir Thorogood. Secretly penning the cartoons under the frothy nom de plume, Clara hopes to  save enough money so that she can leave her in-laws and find a new residence. Now she is determined to reveal an imposter&#39;s identity-and that means doing some undercover work herself. But pretending to be someone you&#39;re not has a funny way of making a woman do things she wouldn&#39;t ordinarily dream of-even if it drives her straight into the arms of her devilishly handsome adversary!&lt;/p&gt;" />
