  <title>The Only One (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Love has no price.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brooke Beauclere was under no illusions. To Adam Henderson she was an object of fleeting desire - upper class, stunningly beautiful, elusively tantalizing - a suitable conquest for an over-confident male with a fortune at his disposal. Oh, how she longed to teach him a lesson for his arrogant assumption that she could be purchased - at any price!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why, he was no more feeling than the high-society snobs who&#39;d once humiliated him for his working-class roots. Against all reason, Brooke was attracted to him and running from the time when she might reveal her love and risk losing Adam completely.&lt;/p&gt;
