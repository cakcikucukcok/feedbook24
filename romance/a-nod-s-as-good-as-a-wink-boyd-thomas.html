  <title>A Nod’S as Good as a Wink … - Boyd Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the early, swinging 70s in London, and Ollie is riding the wave. There&#39;s a day-job and rent to pay but that never gets in the way of the pubs and the women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does get in the way is the ever present black dog of depression: a depression that clouds his daily life with feelings of guilt, more or less about everything. And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, add a stalker to the mix, no doubt the result of something else he&#39;s guilty of, and Ollie knows he&#39;s in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he needs to get his head right, but it&#39;s not until his shrink, Kline, hypnotizes him that Ollie remembers dark events in his early years and he is able to confront his demons, inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#39;A Nod&#39;s As Good As A Wink ...&lt;/em&gt;&#39; is Ollie&#39;s tale of discovery, full of pain and humor, as he goes from relationship to relationship looking for his place in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
