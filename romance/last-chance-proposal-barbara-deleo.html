  <title>Last Chance Proposal - Barbara deLeo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Last Chance Proposal by Barbara DeLeo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A wife he needs. The woman he desires. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cy Hathaway needs a wife, fast, to win custody of his son, Jonty. He returns home to discover the childhood sweetheart he once left behind has become a vibrant, beautiful woman. Even though wanting to sweep her off her feet wasn&#39;t part of the plan...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ellie, Cy&#39;s sudden reappearance awakens a flood of memories--and resentments for the way he&#39;d abandoned her all those years ago. But she has a life now, a career. She can&#39;t simply drop everything and get hitched, even if the sight of him still makes her heart race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after Ellie meets his little boy, she can&#39;t refuse. Certain she has a grip on her old feelings for Cy, she agrees to marry her first love until he gains custody. But when did helping out a friend become something with the capacity to hijack her heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
