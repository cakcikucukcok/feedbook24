  <title>The Gift Of Twins (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired Historical) (Little Falls Legacy, Book 3) - Gabrielle Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Unexpected Holiday Blessings&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finding twin five-year-old boys on his doorstep isn’t the first surprise Reverend Benjamin Lahaye has faced lately. Emery Wilkes, the new schoolteacher the town had hired, turned out to be a very pretty woman—not the man they’d been expecting. And though the twins and Emmy are only boarding with Ben until Christmas, the arrangement feels all too natural.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emmy has moved to Minnesota to put loss behind her. Marriage would mean forsaking her position and her purpose, and Ben is an honorable man who understands her refusal to wed. But as he gets closer to tracking down the little boys’ father, Emmy realizes just how much she wants their sweet temporary family to become permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
