  <title>The Immortal Hunter - Lynsay Sands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even vampires need a vacation. But Decker Argeneau&#39;s ends abruptly when he&#39;s asked to help hunt the group of rogue vampires targeting mortals -- one that might include a defector in his own family. Before he can worry about that, though, he&#39;s got to rescue the latest victim. It&#39;s all part of the job, including taking a bullet for a beautiful doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Danielle McGill doesn&#39;t know if she can trust the man who just saved her life. There are too many questions, such as what is the secret organization he says he&#39;s part of, and why do his wounds hardly bleed? However, with her sister in the hands of some dangerous men, she doesn&#39;t have much choice but to trust him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except now Decker&#39;s talking about life mates and awakening a passion that&#39;s taking Dani beyond anything she&#39;s ever known. Being undead may not be half-bad...especially if it means spending forever with a man who would love her with his mind, body, and immortal soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
