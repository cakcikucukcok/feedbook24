          &lt;strong&gt;Missing Memories&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a John Doe washes up on the shores of Calico Bay, no one knows who he is—including him. But one thing&#39;s instantly clear to deputy sheriff Audrey Martin: the man&#39;s marked for murder. And she&#39;s the only one who can protect him from the assassins who lurk at every turn. The arrival of a team of men claiming he&#39;s Canadian Border Services officer Nathanial Longhorn only further complicates the matter. As his memories slowly start drifting back, Nathanial&#39;s determined to work with Audrey to uncover who wants him dead and why. But he&#39;s tangled in something that threatens to submerge them both. And unless Audrey can help him figure out what, this Christmas might be their last.&lt;/p&gt;
