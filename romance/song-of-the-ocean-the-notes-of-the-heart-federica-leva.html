  <title>Song Of The Ocean-The Notes Of The Heart - Federica Leva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nice, 1922. Shy and modest, Elenoire has two great loves: Adrien and her piano. When he forces her to choose between their bond and the music of her heart, Elenoire is desperate. Giving up one of them would mean dying. During a trip to Nice, the two newlyweds get lost in a village cloaked in surrealism, where they meet special characters, such as a blind painter who paints only women&#39;s nudes and an adventurer who lives in the caves on the sea, along with his cats and an old reed organ. Then the sea will bring a murderer torn apart by remorse who will teach Elenoire the thrill of passion. While Adrien seeks consolation in the arms of a beautiful violinist, she discovers in herself a strength and ardor that she did not suspect to possess. Posing naked for the painter, she confronts her own soul and rediscovers the fire of her own femininity. The woman who emerges gradually looks the same as Adrien left, but at the same time she is different. And now it is he who must be forgiven, if he does not want to lose the only true love of his life.
An intense and romantic love story, which will drag the reader into an ecstasy of notes and poetry.&lt;br/&gt;" />
