After all, she&#39;s been promised to the very lofty Duke of Hollindrake for the last four years. Now all she has to do is meet him. But what Felicity doesn&#39;t realize is that she &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; met her duke&amp;#8212;he&#39;s the altogether too handsome man who Felicity has just mistaken . . . &lt;em&gt;for her new footman&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By rights, Thatcher should immediately set this presumptuous chit straight and tell her he has no intention of honoring the arranged betrothal. But he&#39;s quickly smitten by Felicity&#39;s delightful determination, her irrepressible charm . . . and her breathtaking sensuality. Yes, she&#39;d wed him in an instant were his true identity revealed&amp;#8212;but Thatcher&#39;s vowed to marry only for love. So begins his deception and his conquest of this uncommon woman who doesn&#39;t believe in romance, but is about to find her heart and passion set aflame by the unlikely man she&#39;s sworn to resist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
