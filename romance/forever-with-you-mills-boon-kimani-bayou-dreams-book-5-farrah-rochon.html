          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;New life. New love? &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tranquil bayou town of Gauthier is the perfect place for widowed single mother Leslie Kirkland to raise her two daughters. Until she&#39;s elected president of the elementary school&#39;s Parent-Teacher Organization. Caught in a clash between the community and progressive science-teacher-turned-assistant-principal Gabriel Franklin, Leslie vows not to take sides. But it&#39;s hard to be objective when a sexy younger man is awakening such an irresistible desire.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Years ago, a teacher saved Gabriel from a one-way path to destruction, and now he is dedicated to his students and the Louisiana town he calls home. But the chemistry sizzling between him and Leslie could ignite a scandal. And when the gathering firestorm threatens both their dreams, Gabe is ready to take a stand. Can he convince Leslie that it&#39;s time to move on and make a bright future…with him?&lt;/p&gt;
