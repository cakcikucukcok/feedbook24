        &lt;p&gt;Could a summer fling lead&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;to something more…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, Joe left town to make his way&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;in Hollywood – leaving Mary Jane behind to nurse her secret crush. So why was he suddenly back in town, little twin daughters in tow, working at his dad’s garage?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All Mary Jane’s ever wanted is a husband and family. Yet, as her old crush on Joe revives itself, dare she believe that handsome, gorgeous Joe actually wants her, and for more than just a steamy summer affair?&lt;/p&gt;
