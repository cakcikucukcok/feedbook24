  <title>Twice the Bang - Delilah Devlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beau wants Pansy as his own. He&#39;s been taking it slow with the sexy sub, but when he sees he&#39;s not the only one vying for her attention, he realizes a long seduction was a mistake. So he&#39;s ready to stake his claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billy may be new to the lifestyle, and a submissive like Pansy is probably out of his league, but he&#39;ll do whatever it takes to have her, even if he has to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pansy&#39;s stuck between a rock and a hard place--or rather, stuck between a smoking-hot firefighter with ice-blue eyes and a mysterious, sexy cop. Of course, she could refuse to decide between the two and let them both pursue her, and if she&#39;s really lucky, they&#39;ll play dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each novella in the Delta Blue series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Five Ways &#39;til Sunday&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Fournicopia&lt;br&gt;Book 3: A Perfect Trifecta&lt;br&gt;Book 4: Twice the Bang&lt;br&gt;Book 5: Once is Never Enough&lt;/p&gt;" />
