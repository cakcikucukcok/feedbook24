  <title>Promises of the Heart - Nan Rossiter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first novel in a new series from&amp;#160;bestselling author Nan Rossiter tells the moving story of a couple struggling to start a family and the young foster girl with a heart condition who changes their lives forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A multi-leveled, beautifully written story that will glow in readers&amp;#8217; hearts long after the last page is turned.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Kristan Higgins, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;bestselling author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can the course that they&amp;#8217;ve set for the future handle a slight detour...?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macey and Ben Samuelson have much to be thankful for: great friends, a beautiful&amp;#8212;if high-maintenance&amp;#8212;Victorian house on idyllic Tybee Island, and a rock-solid marriage. The only thing missing is what they want the most. After her fifth miscarriage in six years, Macey worries that the family they&amp;#8217;ve always dreamed of might be out of reach. Her sister suggests adoption, but Macey and Ben aren&amp;#8217;t interested in pursuing that path...until a three-legged golden retriever named Keeper wags his way into their home and their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper Wheaton just got kicked out of another foster home and it won&amp;#8217;t be the last if she keeps losing her temper. She&amp;#8217;s not sure why she gets mad; maybe because no family seems to want a nine-year-old girl with a heart condition. She loves her social worker, Cora, but knows that staying with her forever isn&amp;#8217;t an option. Will she ever find a family to call her own?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a physician&amp;#8217;s assistant, Macey meets lots of kids. Harper Wheaton&amp;#8217;s a tough one, but Macey knows the little girl has already struggled more than most. It gets Macey and Ben to thinking about all the children who need homes. Then Harper goes missing, and one thing is suddenly crystal clear: life is complicated&amp;#8212;but love doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be. &lt;/p&gt;" />
