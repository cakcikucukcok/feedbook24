  <title>Tempt the Night - Dixie Lee Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dixie Lee Brown concludes her thrilling Trust No One series with the fast-paced tale of a damaged hero and the sexy fugitive he can&amp;#39;t help falling for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samantha &amp;#34;Mac&amp;#34; McCallister barely believes her own tale of dirty cops and murder that landed her in the hands of the sexy Jim Brady. One minute she was enjoying a ride-along in her best friend&amp;#39;s cruiser, the next he&amp;#39;s dead and she&amp;#39;s wanted for his murder. Mac never expected to be hiding out from the law, but with Jim by her side, maybe she can survive long enough to clear her name. The question is, can she survive the way Jim makes her feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Navy Seal Jim Brady works best under pressure. At least he used to. Now, fighting flashbacks from his time in Iraq, he has given up everything he knows in order to protect the innocent &amp;#8230; from himself. So working with a woman on the run from the law? Not in his plans for this lifetime. Still, something about the blue-eyed beauty tells him she&amp;#39;s not the source of the danger&amp;#8212;she&amp;#39;s running from it. Deep down he knows he&amp;#39;ll protect her no matter what. But his heart? That&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
