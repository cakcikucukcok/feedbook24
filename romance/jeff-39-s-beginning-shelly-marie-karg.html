  <title>Jeff&#39;s Beginning - Shelly Marie Karg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He stood back, behind the rest of the non-living group that he had become associated with as they followed the group of young ladies out of the club.  He knew that nothing good was going to come from this venture.  Yet, his curiosity was piqued.  There was a blonde, she was young and pretty.  Something about her made him think back to a time before he had become one of the cold people.  She looked familiar. So familiar that he wanted to reach out and touch her to feel her face and see if he could remember just what it was he sensed about her.  But he couldnt, he couldnt show compassion around the others.  He wasnt supposed to have any humanity left inside of him; he wasnt sure what could happen to him if they knew.  He detested this life he had been forced into living, if you could even call it a life.  He regretted with everything he had left to give the night he was forced to accept the change.  What he would give if he could go back.  Back to the time of warmth, back to the time he existed without the hunger, without the cravings.  Even now he only took what he needed to sustain his so called life.  If need be, he took only from the animals unless he was faced with a situation that would make him have to feed from the Human.  Please, let them spare her, at least until he had the chance to be near her.  Something about her eyes when they caught a glimpse of him took him back, back to a time when." />
