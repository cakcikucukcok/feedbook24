      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does tragedy define a person? In the aftermath of loss, can we ever hope to start over? Jason O&amp;rsquo;Brien is trying to start over. After the death of his wife, he lives a routine life boarding neurosis. Some might say he&amp;#39;s not really living, but for Jason, monotony is security. He&amp;#39;s safe now, but alone, very much alone. Until, one day a simple mistake sets him on a path causes him to question his comfortable perspective. True Garcia, a journalism major, has an assignment to write a story about a news event that occurred on the day she was born. She finds Christine Michaels, a young mother who died in an unexplained shooting. True&amp;#39;s search for more information regarding Christine Michaels&amp;rsquo; death leads her to Professor Jason O&amp;rsquo;Brien. True and Jason set out to learn what happened to a woman that touched both their lives through her death, yet their own lives&amp;rsquo; tragedies bring them together unexpected ways. Jason is brought to spiritual awareness through True&amp;rsquo;s belief in Jesus Christ and her large loving family. The mystery within his own soul is revealed as he discovers the end of his loneliness is found in a surprising new relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
