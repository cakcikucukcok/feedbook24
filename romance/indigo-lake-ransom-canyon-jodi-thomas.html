  <title>Indigo Lake (Ransom Canyon) - Jodi Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Two families long divided by an ancient feud. Can a powerful love finally unite them?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blade Hamilton is the last of his line. He&#39;s never even heard of Crossroads, Texas, until he inherits land there. Riding in on his vintage Harley-Davidson, Blade finds a weathered ranch house, an empty prairie and a dark river that cuts a decisive path between the Hamiltons&#39; land and that of their estranged neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Dakota helps a stranger on the roadside, she isn&#39;t prepared for the charisma of the man on the motorbike—or for the last name he bears: Hamilton—her family&#39;s sworn enemies, representing all she&#39;s been raised to loathe. The problem is, it looks like Blade is in town to stay, and there&#39;s something about his wolf-grey eyes she just can&#39;t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lauren Brigman feels adrift. Unhappy in work and unlucky in love, she knows she ought to be striving for more, but she&#39;s never truly at peace unless she&#39;s at home in Crossroads. If the wider world can&#39;t satisfy her, is home truly where her heart is?&lt;/p&gt;

I read it as a stand-alone book and had no trouble keeping up with it. As a matter of fact, I could not put it down. This is not a historical romance which Jodi Thomas is known for writing, but a contemporary romantic suspense.<br /><b><i>Indigo Lake (Ransom Canyon #6) by Jodi Thomas</i></b> | Bestselling author, Jodi Thomas, puts out another emotional, heartwarming "Ransom Canyon" story. "Indigo Lake" brings together two divided families by way of Harley-riding, Blake Hamilton, who never heard of Crossroads, Texas; and, Dakota Davis. Then there's Lauren Brigman, who we've grown up with. She's never happy unless she's in Crossroads.<br /><b><i>Indigo Lake: A Clean &amp; Wholesome Romance (Ransom Canyon ...</i></b> | Indigo Lake (Ransom Canyon, book 6) by Jodi Thomas - book cover, description, publication history.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Indigo Lake (Ransom Canyon) - Jodi Thomas</a> </h3></p><hr/>
