  <title>It Takes All Kinds! - C. Leon Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It Takes All Kinds&lt;/I&gt; takes a look at life without the labels. So many times people try to live their lives according to the labels that the world puts on them. That is absolutely unnecessary. The characters in this book could live next door to you or just down the street. They live their lives according to the rules that work for them. The world uses terms like interracial, bi-sexual, gay or lesbian, why can&#39;t we all just be human. That&#39;s what we all are anyway. In most cases we are all looking for generally the same things, as the United States Declaration of Independence calls them; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As one reads this book it is the hope that each reader will find someone they know, or some experience that is similar to something that they have gone through. This book will show its readers new ways of looking at things that have been explained to them by people who did not actually have a point of reference to make any explanations. It may shine a light or a bit of understanding on facets of life that many people have never even considered. &lt;I&gt;It Takes All Kinds &lt;/I&gt;will look at a few situations that could have happened at almost any point in time, with a subtle instructive insight. The circumstances that will be developed are plausible as well as intriguing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Be prepared to be captivated by the realism of the characters, amused by the comedy in their antics, excited by the pragmatism of each scenario and teased by the sensuality of the various relationships from &lt;I&gt;It Takes All Kinds; an adventure in lust, love and life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
