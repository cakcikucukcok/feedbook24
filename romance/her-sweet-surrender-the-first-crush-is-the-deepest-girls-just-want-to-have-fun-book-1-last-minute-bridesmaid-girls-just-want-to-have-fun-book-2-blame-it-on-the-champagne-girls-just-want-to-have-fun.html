          &lt;strong&gt;The First Crush is the Deepest&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You never forget your first…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sam Richards was Amber DuBois’s first crush, first kiss and first love. Until he broke her heart, took her mother’s pay-off and ran.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now older and wiser, world famous concert pianist Amber is at a crossroads in her life and yearning for something more. She dreams of another life in India. But the sweetheart who spurned her is back – hotter, richer and in need of a favour!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Glamour, romance and old heartaches re-surface, but will her first crush stand the test of time?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Last-Minute Bridesmaid&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kate Lovat, aspiring fashion designer, isn’t used to stepping out in her own glamorous gowns. But Heath Sheridan, her old school crush turned publisher extraordinaire, needs an emergency bridesmaid and a girlfriend stand-in, and offers Kate his business know-how in exchange for a weekend of pretence…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Limousines, stylish dresses and hot CEOs chasing after her – Kate is finally living her teenage fantasy! But the sparks with Heath are even greater than she could ever imagined, and soon Kate realises that you have to be careful what you wish for – because sometimes you get a whole lot more than you bargained for!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Blame it on the Champagne&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;English rose Saskia Elwood has slaved for years to turn her family estate into London’s most exclusive venue. She&#39;s not going to do anything to jeopardise its success! So considering wine magnate Rick Burgess’s business proposition would be nothing short of madness…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But, before she can catch her breath, her heart-stoppingly gorgeous new business partner has swept her off to Europe for intimate champagne tastings and once in a lifetime experiences. Saskia won’t be able to blame the sparks flying between them on the champagne for much longer!&lt;/p&gt;
