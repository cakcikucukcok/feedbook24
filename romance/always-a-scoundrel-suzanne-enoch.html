  <title>Always a Scoundrel - Suzanne Enoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Never a gentleman . . . until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Bramwell Johns, the second son of a duke, is an unrepentant scoundrel. Now that his two closest friends are disgustingly ensconced in domestic bliss, Bram is feeling strangely restless. And not even relieving London&#39;s least deserving artistocrats of their ill-gotten jewels is enough&amp;#8212;until the night he overhears an argument. It seems that Lady Rosamund Davies is about to be forced into marriage with a rogue even worse than himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose is well aware of Bram&#39;s scandalous reputation, so any reason for his sudden interest in her is suspect; more so since he&#39;s close friends with the man about to ruin her family! She has her own plan though, and Bram may be just what she requires&amp;#8212;as long as she remembers that he is only looking out for himself. As long as she remembers that his kisses and caresses don&#39;t mean anything. As long as she can keep from wondering whether she can trust a scoundrel . . . with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
