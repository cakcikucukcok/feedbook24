        &lt;p&gt;THE BRIDE OF MONTEFALCO&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ally Parker has come to Italy with questions about her past only Gino, Duc of Montefalco, can answer. Swept away to his magical country estate, Ally begins to fall in love. But the terrible sins of the past could destroy their hope for a future together! Princess Australia Natasha Telford is an everyday, hardworking Australian girl. Dante Andretti is gorgeous, charming… and an Italian prince! They couldn’t be more different. But Dante needs Natasha’s help. And in return he might make her his own princess…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HER ROYAL WEDDING WISH&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly in danger, Princess Shoshauna of B’Ranasha is whisked away to an exotic island by soldier Jake Ronan. He’s been hired to protect her and, despite the attraction, makes it clear he’s here for duty, not love. But she can dream of marrying this hardened warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
