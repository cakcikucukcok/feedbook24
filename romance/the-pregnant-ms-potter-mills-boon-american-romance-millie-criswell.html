  <title>The Pregnant Ms. Potter (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Millie Criswell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Place this quilt upon your bed and in one month you shall be wed…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pregnant and alone, Maddy Potter knew marriage wasn&#39;t in her near future–certainly not to Pete Taggart. The rude, arrogant–and she&#39;d admit, protectively sexy–rancher would never ask &lt;em&gt;her!&lt;/em&gt; Just because the handsome widower rescued her from a blizzard and she&#39;d slept under his heirloom quilt for two nights did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean anything would happen between them. Surely the quilt&#39;s legend wasn&#39;t real…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pete had reasons for maintaining his status as one of Sweetheart, Colorado&#39;s most eligible bachelors. But seeing Maddy blossom with pregnancy shook him to the soul. A woman shouldn&#39;t be alone at a time like that. And he didn&#39;t have to love her to give her his name…did he?&lt;/p&gt;
