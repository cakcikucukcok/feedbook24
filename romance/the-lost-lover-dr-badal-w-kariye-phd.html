  <title>The Lost Lover - Dr. Badal W. Kariye Phd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Let me tell you that love is a real challenge in life, and if you fall in love with someone in the urbanized town then you&#39;re completely fed up with him or her. Your next option is to go away for a while to remote areas where you seek a handsome groom or a beautiful bride for better future in your lifestyle.
My visionary mission was to find my best nomadic bride or brides if I fed up with girls and ladies in the urbanized towns while some of my close platonic girls have been trying to secure nomadic grooms all over the globe.
Why love is a real challenge in your lifestyle?
If you need to know more about the challenges in love then let&#39;s read this beloved novel in comparative romance which I walked away from the urbanized lifestyle in order to adapt authoritative nomadic lifestyle, which turns and can have ups and downs in your lifestyle.
Well, I loved you my dear queens however; I couldn&#39;t understand why women rejected polygamy?  If jealousy was the reason then why some men preferred monogamy? Let&#39;s share how love in any lifestyle can be a challenge? I encountered it, and I&#39;ve to share my experience with you.
My global readers, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, love are a silent killer if you don&#39;t find its cure as soon as you fall in love with someone.
Please you never tell to a woman that youre a polygamist even if it&#39;s part of your traditional customs.  
I believe that this beloved novel will help and liberate you to use and get the right solutions in love correctly and romantically regardless your race, religion or political views.
I love you all." />
