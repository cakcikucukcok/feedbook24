  <title>Stealing The Cowboy&#39;s Heart (Mills &amp; Boon Western Romance) (Made in Montana, Book 17) - Debbi Rawlins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Discover the Made in Montana miniseries—where all your cowboy dreams come true!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kylie Richardson has always known she wanted a family. So much so that she waited years for her rodeo-riding boyfriend to make it big and settle down. Then she discovered that he was a lying cheat—so she’s started a new life in a new town.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kylie is shocked when Landon Kincaid, her ex’s best friend, shows up in Blackfoot Falls. There was always an attraction between them, but neither of them ever acted on it. The spark is still there, but can she take a chance on another rising rodeo champ? Kylie doesn’t want to come second to the rodeo again, so it’s up to Landon to prove that she’s first in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
