  <title>Meet the Earl at Midnight - Gina Conkle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Phantom of London. Enigma Earl. The Greenwich Recluse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Half of his face, shadowed by gold and brown whiskers, showed male perfection, but the other half, a bizarre pattern of scar lines and puckered flesh. Truly, staring at his face was akin to seeing a painting of two men, split down the middle. Lydia recoiled as much from the hot anger flashing in his eyes as from astonishment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HE&#39;S A MYSTERIOUS RECLUSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lord Greenwich is notoriously elusive.

And no one is more surprised than Miss Lydia Montgomery when she is betrothed to the earl in order to save her family from penury. But if Lydia wants a chance at happiness, she&#39;ll have to set aside her fear of Lord Greenwich and discover the man hiding behind the beastly reputation... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Phantom of London.
