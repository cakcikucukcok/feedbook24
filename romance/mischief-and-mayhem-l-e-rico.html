      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Mayhem, Minnesota, home of the Knitty Kitty, The Little Slice of Heaven Pie Shop, and O&#39;Halloran&#39;s Pub--owned by the four young women known as the Whiskey Sisters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the wake of her divorce, Jameson O&#39;Halloran has gone man-vegan. And this is one diet she&#39;s determined to stick with. Even when her long-lost ex-brother-in-law shows up looking like two scoops of double dutch dipped in chocolate... She&#39;s not giving in. Been there and still wearing the messy T-shirt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been a decade since Scott Clarke left his family and his hometown, never to return. But when tragedy strikes, he finds himself dragged back to the land of gossip, judgment, and the one woman he absolutely, positively, without a doubt can never have. His brother&#39;s ex is off-limits. He just needs to keep repeating that to himself until it sinks in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Whiskey Sisters series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Blame it on the Bet&lt;br&gt;* Mischief and Mayhem&lt;br&gt;* Mistletoe in Mayhem Boxed Set&lt;/p&gt;" />
