      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Take it Like a Vamp by Candace Havens Vampire Nick Christos might&#39;ve been born in the Middle Ages, but the good old days seem tame compared to the last eight years he&#39;s spent ruling the Supernatural Council. His only respite is with his cute neighbor Casey Meyers, a woman he wants more than any undead man should. Sure, he&#39;s forced to take a cold shower after every encounter, but there&#39;s no way he&#39;ll test his own strength by getting too close to a human, and he&#39;s not willing to risk her life--not with bloodthirsty family on the prowl out to ruin Nick&#39;s life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When said Nick&#39;s kin shows up, the innocent Casey is caught in the middle of a centuries old fight, and Nick&#39;s biggest fear is realized. Now, instead of keeping his hands off his neighbor, he&#39;ll risk everything to save the human he&#39;s come to love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
