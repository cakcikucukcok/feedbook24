  <title>The Marriage Charm - Linda Lael Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The women of Bliss County have a pact&amp;#151;to find husbands. The right husbands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;One already has: Hadleigh Stevens, who married rancher Tripp Galloway a few months ago. Now Melody Nolan thinks it&#39;s her turn. Melody has recently found success as a jewelry designer, and her work is the focus of her life. She&#39;s not exactly unhappy, but she wants more. She&#39;s always been attracted to Spence Hogan, the local chief of police, but she&#39;s convinced that Spence, a notorious charmer, isn&#39;t what you&#39;d call husband material.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Spence is a good cop who isn&#39;t scared of anything&amp;#151;except love. And he&#39;s done everything he can to preserve his reputation as a womanizer&amp;#151;a reputation that keeps marriage-minded women, including Melody, at bay. And yet&amp;#133;there&#39;s something about Melody he can&#39;t forget. Something his heart can&#39;t ignore." />
