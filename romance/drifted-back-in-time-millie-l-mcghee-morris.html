Emily, a young slave, is purchased by the loving Hoover family, who raise her as part of the family. But is she prepared for the expectations made upon her by both Master Hoover and Madam Hoover? Will she be able to provide a future for her children, a future that enables each to decide whether to pass for white or be true to themselves and their heritage? This story of love and sacrifice is told through the eyes of Tyara Nordstrom, a descendent plagued by the nightmares of her familys past who journeys back to learn the truth of her origins, ultimately forced to face her own fears. &lt;em&gt;Drifted Back in Time&lt;/em&gt; presents a unique perspective of life in the nineteenth century, when one drop of blood could condemn you to a life of servitude&lt;/p&gt;" />
