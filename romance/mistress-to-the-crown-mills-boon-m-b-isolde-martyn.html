  <title>Mistress to the Crown (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Isolde Martyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Royal Mistress &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Lambard was to become known as the notorious whore, &#39;Jane Shore&#39; — lover of King Edward IV. The day Lord Hastings came into her husband&#39;s shop, Elizabeth saw a vital opportunity to separate herself from her dull, impotent husband, William Shore. The handsome stranger might be her only chance to partake in the dance of desire and annul her marriage. She did not, however, foresee her introduction to the King of England, nor her future at his side…and in his bed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From this unlikely alliance, Elizabeth is granted severance from Shore, and flourishes due to the Yorkist King&#39;s admiration. But her new position comes at a terrible price — her family shun her, the people of London label her a harlot and the White Queen&#39;s family are powerful enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So long as King Edward and Hastings stay close, Elizabeth is safe. But her beloved Ned falls ill and Richard III’s supporters gather. Can Elizabeth’s beauty keep her out of trouble? Or will it lead her to the hangman’s noose?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Rich and vivid… Passion, drama, glamour and wit turn this story of a woman who challenges her world into an unforgettable experience.’ –ANNA CAMPBELL &lt;em&gt;International bestselling historical romance author&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
