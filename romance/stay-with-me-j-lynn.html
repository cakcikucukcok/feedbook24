She&amp;#8217;s never been kissed, never seen the ocean, never gone to an amusement park. But growing up, she witnessed some things no child ever should.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; She still carries the physical and emotional scars of living with a strung-out mother, Mona&amp;#8212;secrets she keeps from everyone, including her close circle of college friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the safe cocoon Calla has carefully built is shattered when she discovers her mom has stolen her college money and run up a huge credit card debt in her name. Now, Calla has to go back to the small town she thought shed left behind and clean up her mom&amp;#8217;s mess again. Of course, when she arrives at her mother&amp;#8217;s bar, Mona is nowhere to be found. Instead, six feet of hotness named Jackson James is pouring drinks and keeping the place humming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexy and intense, Jax is in Calla&amp;#8217;s business from they moment they meet, giving her a job and helping her search for Mona. And the way he looks at her makes it clear he wants to get horizontal . . . and maybe something more. Before Calla can let him get close, though, she&amp;#8217;s got to deal with the pain of the past&amp;#8212;and some very bad guys out to mess her up if she doesn&amp;#39;t give them her mom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
