      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The brand new, never-before-published novel in #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller Lora Leigh&#39;s deliciously sexy Bound Hearts series, where one woman must accept--or reject--the love of a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOO HOT TO HANDLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Her name is Summer, as beautiful and occasionally fierce as her name suggests. Her past has just come back to haunt her, and suddenly she&#39;s not sure who she can trust. Her longtime confidantes  Falcone and Raeg seem to have Summer&#39;s best interests at heart. . .but it&#39;s clear that their desire for her still burns between them. Can they find a way to keep Summer safe--or will a bitter rivalry stand in their way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falcone and Raeg need to work together, now more than ever, if they intend to protect Summer from an old enemy who knows her dangerous secret. When Summer&#39;s identity as a sweet, Southern socialite gets out, the two men must find a way to draw out the ruthless assassin on her trail. . .and keep their illicit romance with her under wraps. But some passions are so intense they can&#39;t remain hidden. What are Falcone and Raeg willing to risk for the woman they both crave like no other, in &lt;i&gt;Intense Pleasure, &lt;/i&gt;the next &lt;i&gt;Bound Hearts &lt;/i&gt;novel from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Lora Leigh.&lt;/p&gt;" />
