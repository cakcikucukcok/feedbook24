  <title>Love Me to Death - Marissa Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Medical research scientist Elena Arcos has always lived her life under the radar. When she is shot in a convenience store robbery, Elena finds herself rocketed into supernatural insanity courtesy of a sexy immortal law enforcer. He&#39;s convinced she&#39;s some kind of freaky half-vampire thing and that her deceased dad was the real deal: a blood sucking monster. Yeah, right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikolai Itzov never anticipated battling the urge to kiss the offspring of his father&#39;s murderer. As a Slayer, an elite law enforcer descended from Azrael himself, his orders from the Underveil General are clear: Kill her or die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikolai and Elena find themselves in a life and death battle to stop a plot designed to lift the Underveil and enslave humans. With her analytical mind and his centuries of training, they might be able to foil the plot with their lives and maybe their hearts intact. But in order to succeed, he must help her become the very thing he hates the most: an Undead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
