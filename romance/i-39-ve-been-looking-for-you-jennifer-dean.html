  <title>I&#39;ve Been Looking For You - Jennifer Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the past ten years, MAX EVANS has grown used to not getting attached. So, of course, Portland, Maine will be no different than any other town, her single father has uprooted her from throughout the years. That&amp;rsquo;s until she meets EMILY WILLIAMS, a smart and straight-laced girl, who brings out an unexpected longing in Max that she was unaware she needed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their rocky first meeting, the girls forge an easy friendship that blossoms and breaks down the guarded walls they have both have built. But complications arise when Max begins to fall in love with Emily, who is, not only taken but straight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Max doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize is that Emily feels her own stir of attraction for Max. An attraction that leads her to pursue, what she only assumes is a lustful curiosity. But, as if lying dormant, a new heartbeat pulses unexpectedly to life beneath the surface of her teenage lust. She&amp;rsquo;s in love with Max. But being in love isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy. Especially for Emily, who has only known one part of her sexuality her whole life. And the fear of her exposure is what begins to limit and strain the new connection between the girls. A fear that will leave Emily to fight against society&amp;rsquo;s approval in order to win back Max&amp;rsquo;s trust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, once the two girls are openly together it brings up another issue that neither can control. Unknown to either, JASON, Emily&amp;rsquo;s ex-boyfriend, stuffs drugs into Max&amp;rsquo;s locker before anonymously ratting her out to the principal. An event that tears the girls apart only weeks after publicly coming out as a couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with evidence piled up against Max, the two girls are left helpless once Max is sentenced unfairly to ten years for drug possession. And though it eases the pain to have Emily visit, Max decides the girl she loves can have a better life without her. So instead of holding her back, she lets her go, breaking her own heart in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Emily never gives up hope of finding a way to prove Max&amp;rsquo;s innocence. A hope that follows her into her first year of college. And after five months she is given a lucky break when she encounters a run in with Jason. The chance encounter leads her to discover how his jealousy of her new relationship had impulsively led him to plant the felonious amount of drugs into Max&amp;rsquo;s locker. But if she thought the betrayal ended there she was mistaken. Because as she plans a brave attempt at gaining a confession, to take to the police, she learns the one who holds the biggest secret is her best friend, ALLISON.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her plan was the same for Emily but help, from the most unexpected person, comes in the form of Max&amp;rsquo;s father, Henry. Thanks to a previously received letter from Emily he was able to form a plan to follow Jason, leading to a spontaneous rescue of Emily. The only problem is that while Henry successfully disables Allison and her corrupt police partner, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to prevent the bullet already released from Allison&amp;rsquo;s gun. A bullet that puts Emily into a coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later Max is finally released from prison after serving seven months of her ten-year sentence. But her bittersweet reality is tarnished by the news of Emily&amp;rsquo;s coma. Luckily after two weeks of patience and guilt, her deepest wish comes true as Emily wakes up and the two are reunited. Finally, they are free to be together without any obstacles or consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
