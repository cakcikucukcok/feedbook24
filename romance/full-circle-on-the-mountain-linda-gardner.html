  <title>Full Circle on the Mountain - Linda Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Do you believe a personal destiny exists for each of us? If it were possible to catch a glimpse of that destiny, would you have the courage, faith and strength of heart to follow it? What would be the cost, and what would have to be lain on the altar of sacrifice?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;FULL CIRCLE on the MOUNTAIN &lt;/I&gt;answers those questions with a powerful and insightful journey into one womans personal destiny.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Claudette Elizabeth McAllister grew up a young woman, in rural South Carolina in the fifties, the daughter of a farmer and his bakery shop attendant wife. She was an ordinary girl, with ordinary dreams of going to college and pursuing a career in accounting. Destiny, however, used those dreams to choose another path for her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;A presumed &quot;chance meeting&quot; with handsome, educated, and wealthy, Johnny Richardson would change her life and set her on a course with destiny which would not rest until she came &lt;I&gt;full circle &lt;/I&gt;with it some twenty years later.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;In the early sixties, fate, in disguise as a life-threatening experience drives her back to her hometown. There she must face the reality of a son born out of wedlock, the tragic accident that killed her best friend and the realization that her life was somehow being orchestrated by forces beyond her control. Forces that continually required her to sacrifice and endure what seemed impossible for the human spirit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;FULL CIRCLE on the MOUNTAIN&lt;/I&gt; is a journey along her path of people, places and events which would not only direct and shape her destiny, but weave its threads deeply into an entire family, unaware they too were a part of the great tapestry of this simple woman.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot; A rare and powerful combination of: entertainment, insight, wisdom and truth.&quot; Henri Forget, free-lance editor.&lt;/P&gt;" />
