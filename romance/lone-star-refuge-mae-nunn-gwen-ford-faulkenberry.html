  <title>Lone Star Refuge - Mae Nunn, Gwen Ford Faulkenberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;He&amp;#39;s willing to risk it all&amp;#133;is she?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Stella Jane Scout has never met a cowboy as handsome as Joiner Temple. Or as aggravating. His Thoroughbred Argentinian stallion and professional polo player pedigree don&amp;#39;t impress her one bit. At heart, he&amp;#39;s still a footloose cowboy from Kilgore, and a reckless one at that. But her father hired him as a ranch hand for her riding school, so she&amp;#39;ll have to rein in Joiner&amp;#39;s wild streak and teach him to put safety first. At the same time, Joiner seems determined to bring out Stella&amp;#39;s long-buried free spirit. If she can give him a place to call home, maybe he can teach her how to live." />
