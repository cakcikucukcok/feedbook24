  <title>10 Rules to Sex Up a Blind Date - Heidi Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;#WorstDatesEver&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a nasty breakup, Tally Gladstone has no interest in anything serious. But she&#39;s dipped her wary toe back into dating with a few blind dates–all bad…or worse. The only good thing to come out of it is a sizable following on social media. Her latest date is doomed from the get-go–he isn&#39;t even straight. But at least he knows someone who meets her every very exacting wish&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;#EpicHotLover?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;American-in-London Brent O&#39;Neill is everything she wants–on paper. He&#39;s hot, sexy and emotionally off-limits. Tally can play all she likes without getting burned. He&#39;s so good in bed he&#39;s addictive. But her millions of social media followers want disaster, not boring-ever-after. They might get their way yet–how is she going to walk away before her heart is in tatters?&lt;/p&gt;
