  <title>Leaving Everest - Megan Westfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Between the adventure, superb writing, and the heart-warming romance, I fell hard. A definite must read!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Rebecca Yarros, author of the Renegades Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-year-old Emily Winslowe has had an adventurous upbringing. Daughter of a Himalayan mountain guide, she has climbed Mount Everest and other peaks most Americans only dream of. But for all her mountaineering prowess, she&#39;s lacking some key experiences. Namely, guys. Especially one guy in particular--Luke Norgay, her childhood best friend who she hasn&#39;t seen since he left for college in the United States two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke unexpectedly reappears as a guide just in time for the Everest climbing season. He&#39;s even more handsome than she remembers, and that something that had been building between them during their last season together is back in front of them, bigger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, there&#39;s a detail about Emily&#39;s past that Luke doesn&#39;t know. It&#39;s the reason she ended up in the Himalayas in the first place...and the reason she must make it to the summit of Mount Everest this year. It&#39;s also the reason she would never consider following him back to Washington after the climbing season ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, they&#39;ll have to survive the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
