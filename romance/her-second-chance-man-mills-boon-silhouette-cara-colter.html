  <title>Her Second-Chance Man (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Cara Colter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Brian Kemp didn&#39;t put much faith in happy endings, but when his orphaned niece&#39;s puppy got sick, the hard-nosed cop turned to the one woman capable of performing miracles….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Back in the day, Jessica Moran had been plain, plump and unpopular–and very much in love with golden-boy Brian. Now she was all grown up, hauntingly beautiful and doing just fine…. Until her high school heartthrob showed up on her doorstep with his sad-eyed niece and injured pup in tow. But Jessica knew better than to give her heart to the man who&#39;d made her stop believing in happily-ever-after long ago…. Didn&#39;t she? He&#39;d asked her to heal the pooch, but maybe she would heal his brooding heart, as well!&lt;/p&gt;
