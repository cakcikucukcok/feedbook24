  <title>The Secret - Linda Sealy Knowles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Secret
News spread like wildfire throughout the whole county that the most eligible bachelor was getting engaged to his beautiful, spirited young sister. How could a brother and sister get married? Everyone knew that they werent blood relatives, but they had grown up together since Hope was only a small child of three.
Will
A rugged young rancher with coal-black hair and crystal-blue eyes had always been bossy, over-protective, and affectionate at times when it came to Hope, his young shadow and later the one to whom he confided his secrets. Will was ready to settle down, fall in love, and start a family. But who would have thought that he would have chosen the spirited young beauty with big brown eyes sparkling with mischief? It was rumored that he had waited for years for his young sidekick, Hope, to grow up.
Hope
A young beauty with golden hair and big brown eyes, Hope had loved Will all of her lifeas a big brother. He was her best friend, protector, enemy, and hero. She had loved him and looked up to him all her life. Will challenged her ever-inappropriate behavior for a young lady while she fought him with all the stubbornness that she could manage. Why would this feisty, exquisite young woman want to settle down with Will, who was more like a real brother to her than a lover?" />
