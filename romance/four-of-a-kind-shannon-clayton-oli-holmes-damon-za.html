  <title>Four of a Kind - Shannon Clayton, Oli Holmes, Damon Za</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever had one of those days where everything that could go wrong does? Deborah Hayes is dealt that exact hand when disaster strikes at an event she&#39;s managing, giving her publicity for all the wrong reasons, not to mention breaking up with her English boyfriend. And the trouble doesn&#39;t just end there, but when Deborah starts to investigate she can&#39;t help but feel like the universe was trying to warn her. Determined not to miss any future &#39;signs&#39; and desperate to attract some good luck, she embarks on a journey of divination, dipping her toes into all sorts of spiritual disciplines, Feng Shui, Palm Reading, Tarot Cards...  After scoring an amazing account at work, things look to be on the up, particularly after meeting her gorgeous Irish neighbour. But sometimes the signs are harder to read than we think, and when the latest up and coming sexy Scottish movie star, and a cute Kiwi guy, both take a shine to her, she&#39;s even more desperate for guidance to help her choose.  Bordering on obsession, Deborah gets caught up in asking questions, looking for signs, and searching for hidden meanings and clues.  Can she make the right choice or is she looking for something that has been right in front of her all along?" />
