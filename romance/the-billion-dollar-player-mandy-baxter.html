  <title>The Billion Dollar Player - Mandy Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Billion Dollar Player &lt;/i&gt;by Mandy Baxter, Jase Blackwell, starting tight end for the Dallas Cowboys, is a pro when it comes to football--and to women. Never one to shy away from a challenge, &quot;Billion Dollar Blackwell&quot; is finally able to get the cute waitress he&#39;s had his eye on out for a little fun. But when their steamy encounters inspire Jase to play better than he ever has before, he has to wonder if this exciting woman is more than just a good luck charm... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avery Lockhart doesn&#39;t understand why a pro football player would want to go out with her. Incredibly wealthy and undeniably sexy, Jase Blackwell is everything she thinks she&#39;s not. Getting a little closer to this enigmatic billionaire, however, proves too much for Avery to resist. But as their passion heats up, so does Jase&#39;s game play, and soon, the rumors start to fly. Is Avery only being kept around to ease Jace&#39;s pre-game superstitions? Or, like she believes, does their connection run deeper...?&lt;/p&gt;" />
