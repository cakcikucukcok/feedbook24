&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edisto Island was where it all came apart. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can the Bennett girls ever be whole again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, they were the happiest family under the sun, crabbing and fishing and painting on beautiful Edisto Island in South Carolina&amp;rsquo;s lowcountry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then everything went wrong, and twenty years later the Bennett family is still in pieces. Mary Ellen still struggles to understand why her picture-perfect marriage came apart. Daughter Meg keeps a death grip on her own family, controlling her relationships at a distance. And eldest daughter, Julia, left it all behind years ago, forging a whole new life as an artist and academic in Manhattan. She&amp;rsquo;s engaged to an art dealer and has no intentions of returning to Edisto. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then an emergency forces Julia back to Edisto to care for her three young half-siblings. She grudgingly agrees to stay a week. But there&amp;rsquo;s something about Edisto that changes people. Can Julia and her fractured family somehow manage to come together again under that low-hanging Edisto moon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A rich, endearing, can&amp;rsquo;t-stop-reading book about what matters most, the power of love to transform the human heart.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Dorothea Benton Frank, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;best-selling author, &lt;em&gt;Porch Lights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
