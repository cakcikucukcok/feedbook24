  <title>If I Only Had a Duke - Lenora Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=center&gt;After four failed seasons and a disastrous jilting, Lady Dorothea Beaumont has had more than enough of her family&amp;#8217;s scheming. She won&amp;#8217;t domesticate a duke, entangle an earl, or vie for a viscount. She will quietly exit to her aunt&amp;#8217;s Irish estate for a life of blissful freedom. Until an arrogant, sinfully handsome duke singles her out for a waltz, making Thea the most popular belle of the season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P align=center&gt;The duke ruined her plans and he&amp;#8217;ll just have to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P align=center&gt;Dalton, Duke of Osborne, is far too heartless for debutantes or marriage&amp;#8212;he uses dalliances and public spectacle to distract from his real purpose: finding the man who destroyed his family. When his search leads to Ireland, the last thing he needs is the determined, achingly innocent Thea, who arrives in the dead of night demanding he escort her to her aunt. His foolish agreement may prove his undoing. The road to the Emerald Isle is fraught with unforeseen dangers, but the greatest peril of all might just be discovering that he has a heart...and he&amp;#8217;s losing it to Thea.&lt;/p&gt;" />
