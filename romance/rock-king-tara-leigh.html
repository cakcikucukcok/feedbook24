  <title>Rock King - Tara Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The most famous rock star in the world has finally found the one, but secrets from his past threaten to ruin both their lives in this &quot;heart-pounding romance&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Fresh Fiction&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Shane Hawthorne has it all. At least, that&#39;s what the headlines say about me. I have millions of fans, awards, more money - and women - than I know what to do with. But what you don&#39;t see is the wreckage I&#39;ve caused. The memories and pain I can&#39;t escape, even when I pour them into music and spin them into gold. &lt;br&gt;  I tried to forget. To lose myself in booze and groupies. It didn&#39;t work. It hurt me and - worse - it hurt my band. That&#39;s the last thing I want to do, so I&#39;m cleaning up my act... starting with Delaney Fraser. &lt;br&gt;  Gorgeous, smart, drama-free, and even nice - Delaney is the perfect &quot;girlfriend.&quot; When I&#39;m with her I don&#39;t have to pretend. It&#39;s like she sees the real me. And I can see a future with her. But that&#39;s dangerous. Because the truth is, Shane Hawthorne doesn&#39;t actually exist. He&#39;s a shield to hide who I really am. Fraud. Runaway. Addict. Murderer.&lt;br&gt;  And it&#39;s impossible to love a lie, right?" />
