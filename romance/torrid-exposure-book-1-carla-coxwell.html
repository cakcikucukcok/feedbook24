  <title>Torrid Exposure - Book 1 - Carla Coxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 1 of the Torrid Exposure New Adult Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Billionaire New Adult Romance Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
April is determined to make it on her own, but when Bennett comes knocking at her door, a whole new problem arises.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
April is finished with school and ready to build a career. Coming from a well-to-do family, she has decided to reboot her life completely. The first step? Removing herself from her family&amp;#39;s will and any chance of inheriting her father&amp;#39;s business. With family scars too deep to mend, April craves a fresh start.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step two? Pursuing her dream of being a full time photographer. Prospects for freelance photography are fierce but April is determined to make it completely on her own. After moving in with her best friend, Emily, she looks forward to making a dent in her new world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But the past is harder to shake than April ever would have imagined. At the center of it all is Bennett, an old family friend who is the heir to a billionaire media mogul company. Bennett and April haven&amp;#39;t been able to stand each other since they were kids. But as the world shifts, the two of them discover the past might be the key to their future.&lt;br /&gt;
