  <title>Save Me from Tomorrow - Richard A. Capogrosso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Out into the world goes the narrator from &lt;I&gt;Save Me From Tomorrow&lt;/I&gt;, who at different times calls himself Sal, Nick or Jake, names of his favorite characters in American fiction. He goes out in search of adventure and experiences like those of his literary heroes, Kerouac, Fitzgerald and Hemingway.&lt;/p&gt;
At age twenty-three he gives up his unexceptional job in Manhattan and plans to explore the highways and byways of America. Then a chance meeting with an old friend and the appearance of a beautiful and intriguing girl named Val cause him to alter his plans and shift locations to London.&lt;/p&gt;
Working in the somewhat seedy yet vibrant world of a London pub, he encounters an eclectic assortment of Londoners and American expatriates, each with stories and secrets of their own. His story quickly becomes intertwined with theirs as he continues his pursuit of Val and seeks to live the fantastic life he imagined. When the lives of his fellow travelers begin to converge, the consequences of his quest become all too real.&lt;/p&gt;" />
