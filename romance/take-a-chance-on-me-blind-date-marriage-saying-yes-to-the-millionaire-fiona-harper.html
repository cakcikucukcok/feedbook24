  <title>Take a Chance on Me: Blind-Date Marriage / Saying Yes to the Millionaire - Fiona Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Every love story starts with daring to take a chance…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rock star’s daughter Serena’s turned her back on her unconventional upbringing, and longs to settle down. Jake is a highly successful and focused businessman. He’s worked hard to escape his roots, and now lives by one rule: never get married! By all rights their blind date should be a disaster, but Jake’s never been very good at following rules…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When cautious Fern is challenged by a friend to say yes to every question, she never expects to spend four days with dreamy explorer Josh doing a charity treasure hunt. Josh never stays in one place—or with one woman—for long. But Fern is challenging that rule. Could she be the treasure he’s been looking for all along?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Two sparkling rom-com stories from the author of Make My Wish Come True &amp; Kiss Me Under The Mistletoe&lt;/strong&gt;
