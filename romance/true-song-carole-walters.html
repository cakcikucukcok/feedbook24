  <title>True Song - Carole Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;True Song&lt;/i&gt; is an allegory dramatizing the faithful journey of the Church as she is challenged to abandon herself sacrificially in pursuit of her beloved Bridegroom, Christ. Conveyed with fable-like simplicity, it is the tale of a songless sparrow named Married whose heart is awakened to a new hope.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Follow the enraptured Married as she is lured away from the stifling isolation of her husband, Loneliness, and into the swampy unknown, on the promise that she is to become the bride of the charming and magnetic Song Sparrow, Prophet. &lt;i&gt;But how is this possible?&lt;/i&gt; she wonders. &lt;i&gt;For I am already Married.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Caught in a scandalous affair, Married follows the course of the river through perilous twists and turns, desperately dependent on the guidance of Counselor and her companion in longsuffering, Faith. Learn how Married, through her adventure filled with astonishing surprises, gains insight into the wonderful mysteries and fulfillment of her marriage to Loneliness, and the significance of her two chicks, Meaning and Purpose. From the silence of the river, she emerges and returns home to River Acres Park with her True Song, proclaiming Counselors faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience the blessing of Gods unlimited ability to transform love and marriage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
