  <title>Serena&#39;s Lovers - Ellen De Rossi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Serena Mariposa Paloma De Vinci lives the jet-setting life-literally. An international air hostess for American Airlines, she has seen it all from her base at New York City, but nothing in her career could have possibly prepared her for what awaits on her next visit to Rome. Leonardo, her father, a handsome and vivacious Catholic priest, adores his beautiful daughter. He has a fun surprise for her: a bubble-gum-pink Mini Cooper convertible. But that is not the most intriguing surprise of the visit.   At his office in Vatican City, he introduces her to Father Alejandro Sebastian De Mateo, his private secretary. He is everything she&#39;s ever desired in a man-tall with long, blond hair and the most intensely green eyes she&#39;s ever seen. Her thoughts immediately turn to dark, decadent, and delicious sin when she looks at him. He is beautiful beyond imagination, charming, sexy, special, and utterly unavailable.   Will their steamy romance have a happy Hollywood ending-or will reality trump the fantasy?" />
