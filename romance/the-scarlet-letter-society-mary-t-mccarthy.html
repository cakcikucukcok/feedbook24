  <title>The Scarlet Letter Society - Mary T. McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This is what &lt;I&gt;really&lt;/I&gt; happens after &#39;I Do&#39;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meet Maggie, Eva, and Lisa, founders of The Scarlet Letter Society. Named as such due to their infidelities, physical and emotional, the &amp;#147;SLS&amp;#8221; is these women&amp;#8217;s refusal to be shamed like Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne&amp;#8217;s classic tale of forbidden longing. Maggie is twice-divorced and juggling three lovers &amp;#151; including her first ex-husband. Eva is trapped in a loveless marriage and has turned to her young intern and a seductive French chef for satisfaction. Lisa dreams of one day becoming a mother, but her husband has more romantic interest in her footwear than he does in her. Once a month, these women meet at their local bookstore to discuss love, life, and literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Through their friendships and liaisons, they attempt to gain insight into the curveballs life has thrown their way, and how each of them can find emotional and sexual fulfillment. A witty, insightful, and steamy novel about a group of women who have chosen to forge their own paths, and must deal with the ramifications of their past and present choices, The Scarlet Letter Society is for anyone who&amp;#8217;s found their fairy tale isn&amp;#8217;t quite what Disney had in mind.&lt;/div&gt;" />
