  <title>King of Hearts - Eileen Putman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Not for nothing is Gabriel Sinclair known as the King of Hearts. His wit beguiles, his charm seduces, and he&amp;rsquo;s never met a woman he couldn&amp;rsquo;t captivate. He&amp;#39;s at home on the sea but nowhere else. As for family? He has seen enough madness in his own to last a lifetime. He shuns hopeless causes, deeper emotions, any whiff of permanence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widowed Louisa Peabody tolerates no man&amp;#39;s touch. Her past has shown her men are seducers and abusers. She devotes herself to helping women in need, but her clumsy efforts often end in disaster. After she accidentally saves Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s life, she persuades him to help her stage a daring rescue from a prison hulk in the Thames.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it&amp;rsquo;s a devil&amp;rsquo;s bargain: Can she protect herself from that wild, reckless fire in his eyes? Can he care for anyone but himself?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The League of Rogues series features daring English lords who risk all for their country. Hardened and deadly, they have no use for love&amp;mdash;until it ensnares them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;" />
