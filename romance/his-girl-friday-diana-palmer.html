  <title>His Girl Friday - Diana Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller Diana Palmer comes a reader-favorite story of a woman attempting to do the impossible: tame the roguish man she loves from afar…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There has only ever been one man for young Danetta Marist…but he&#39;s the one she can never have. That&#39;s gruff, handsome boss Cabe Ritter, whose mere glance makes her spine tingle and her heart race. And then there was that heart-stopping kiss in his office. But Danetta believes in marriage and happily-ever-afters. And everyone knows Cabe is a terrible womanizer…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deep down, Cabe is no playboy. Long ago, he put up a facade to protect himself from any woman–like his alluring secretary–who wanted a commitment from him. Cabe knows that young, fresh and deliciously tempting Danetta has a lot to learn about love. But now that he has held her in his arms once, he decides that he&#39;ll be the man to teach her…for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
