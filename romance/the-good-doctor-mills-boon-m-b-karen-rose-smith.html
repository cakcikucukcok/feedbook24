  <title>The Good Doctor (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Karen Rose Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Peter Clark would never describe himself as a jaw-dropping catch–despite being one of San Antonio&#39;s most respected neurosurgeons. So why is beautiful New York neurologist Violet Fortune looking at him as if she would like to show him her bedside manner? Not that he minds…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;it&#39;s been a long time since he&#39;s met a woman who could ever hope to compete with his work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being with Peter helps workaholic Violet ditch her self-doubt and discover what it feels like to be in the arms of a man who understands the depths of her commitment to medicine. But while that dedication helps heal, it also has the power to force Violet and Peter apart. And suddenly Violet must decide if Texas is truly her home.&lt;/p&gt;
