  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Wolven - Deborah LeBlanc</i></b> | The wolven were different in that their transformation usually occurred when they reached an intense emotional state, be it anger, fear, even sexual arousal. As a wolven matured and learned to control the range of his or her emotions, the mutation trigger became more controllable, the transformation more a matter of will.<br /><b><i>The Wolven - Deborah LeBlanc</i></b> | The Wolven by Deborah LeBlanc is the last novel in The Keepers Trilogy and definitely a fabulous way to end the series. Shauna has inherited the Keepers job when her parents died in the last species war, so she became the keeper of the werewolves. Danyon and Shauna have met before on meetings, but never really got together.<br /><b><i>The Wolven (The Keepers Trilogy #3) by Deborah Leblanc</i></b> | Award-winning and best-selling author, Deborah LeBlanc, is a business owner, a licensed death scene investigator, and an active paranormal investigator.
