  <title>Maggie&#39;s Sweet Bliss: Book 1 In the Maggie Temples Romantic Mystery Series - S. F. M. Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maggie Temples has lived in the small town of Brattenburg, New York, for most of her life. Working part-time at her family&#39;s bakery, Sweet Bliss, while teaching Art at the local community college. Maggie thinks life will continue on in the same old, boring way. That is until one fateful Saturday morning, when a man from Maggie&#39;s past shows back up in Brattenburg. Luke Beckett breezes back into Maggie&#39;s life. Maggie feels the same flutter in her stomach every time she sees Luke, just like she did back in high school. She doesn&#39;t want to rush into anything with Luke, but fate seems to have a different idea for Maggie and her long lost love. Of course, Luke comes back to Brattenburg, and Maggie, at a time when all hell seems to break loose in the small town on the Delaware." />
