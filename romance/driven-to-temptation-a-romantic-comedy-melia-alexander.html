  <title>Driven to Temptation: A Romantic Comedy - Melia Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never wanted it to end.&quot; --NYT Bestseller Marie Harte&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aidan Ross might be an engineering genius, but people skills? Not this soldier&#39;s forte. Thankfully, a trusted friend is accompanying him to a make-or-break tradeshow...but then a bubbly redhead hops into his truck, claiming to be his new road trip buddy. She&#39;s a gorgeous distraction he can&#39;t afford. Or ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delaney Harper comes from a family of engineers--&lt;i&gt;male&lt;/i&gt; engineers. With several impressive projects under her belt, she&#39;s on a mission to prove she can hang with the big boys, too. But cracking the sexy, closed-off CEO is tougher than she expects...and hotter than she could have imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the tempting woman disrupting his carefully planned schedule, Aidan can&#39;t focus on the road, much less their upcoming presentation. The future of his company is riding on this trip, and if they&#39;re to land a huge account, he has to keep his head--and his heart--in the game...&lt;/p&gt;" />
