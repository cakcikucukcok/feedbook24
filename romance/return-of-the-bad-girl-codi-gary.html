  <title>Return of the Bad Girl - Codi Gary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad girls don&#39;t forgive.&lt;br /&gt;Bad girls don&#39;t forget.&lt;br /&gt;Bad girls don&#39;t fall in love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caroline Willis may be known for causing trouble, but she is NOT about to become homeless. So when she learns that her perfect apartment has been double-booked&amp;#8212;to a dangerously hot bad boy&amp;#8212;Caroline&#39;s bad-girl reputation comes out in full force. He may be sexy as sin, but she&#39;s not afraid of him &amp;#8230; or his panty-melting smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rock Canyon&#39;s got room for only one bad attitude&amp;#8212;and Gabe Moriarty was here first. Still, starting over means playing it smart, so while sharing his new apartment is less than ideal, it&#39;s worth getting his dream business off the ground. Not to mention that it means shacking up with a sexy wild child. Caroline may be giving him the cold shoulder, but Gabe always was good at starting fires &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caroline vows to keep things professional with Gabe, but as close quarters begin to ignite the sizzling chemistry between them, she&#39;s left wondering: Bad boy plus bad girl equals nothing but trouble &amp;#8230; right?&lt;/p&gt;" />
