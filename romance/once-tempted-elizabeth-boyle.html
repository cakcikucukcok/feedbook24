  <title>Once Tempted - Elizabeth Boyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A notorious rake, the Marquis of Bradstone stole young Olivia Sutton&#39;s heart...and then ruined her life. For seven years she has been forced to hide her past behind a false identity. And now the dashing scoundrel has returned a different man: more handsome, more serious, more desirable...and far more dangerous thanthe cad who brought scandal and shame into Olivia&#39;s world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapture Found&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Robert Danvers is living a lie&amp;#8212;but for a noble cause. Masquerading as his cousin, the late marquis, Robert&#39;s secret mission for the crown has led him straight to the beautiful, scheming seductress he believes was responsible for his brother&#39;s death. But there is a gentle innocence about this Olivia that belies her murderous reputation&amp;#8212;and a passionate sensuality that makes him yearn to hold her forever in his arms. His loyalty to his mission tells him that surrender would be the worst sort of betrayal&amp;#8212;yet once tempted, how can a man resist, when his heart tells him here is his one true love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
