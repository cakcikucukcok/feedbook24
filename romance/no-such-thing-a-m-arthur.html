      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-two-year-old Alessandro Silva knows that returning to tiny Perch Creek to help his foster mother was the right thing to do. With no degree and a delinquent&#39;s reputation, he&#39;s lucky to have landed a job waiting tables. But not everyone is happy he&#39;s back, and the only thing keeping his move home from being a total bust is his boss&#39;s hot brother.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Jaime Winters spent most of his life watching the world go by, first from a series of hospitals and then from behind big stacks of textbooks. Studying is easier than facing the fact that years of heart failure means he&#39;s still a virgin at twenty-three. Until the new waiter in his sister&#39;s diner awakens desires he&#39;d long ago given up on.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;The last thing Alessandro wants is to fall for someone as fragile as Jaime. And Jaime may have a new heart, but he&#39;s scared of what giving it to another person would mean. Their no-strings-attached, instructional approach to sex keeps emotion safely at bay, until a secret from Alessandro&#39;s past forces them to confront their feelings in the present&amp;#133;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;67,000 words" />
