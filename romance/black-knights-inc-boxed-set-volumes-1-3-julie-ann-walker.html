        &lt;p&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;Hell on  Wheels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;ExMarine  Nate Weller is an expert at keeping his cool, which is how he keeps his  feelings for Ali Morgan in check. Sweet, sexy Ali is his best friend&#39;s  sister...and totally off limits. Ali&#39;s never seen anything sexier than Nate  straddling his custom Harley-or the flash in his eyes when she tells him she&#39;s  in trouble. With Nate, her life is in his capable hands--but her heart is  another story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;In  Rides Trouble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble  tends to find Becky Reichert. Like the day ex-SEAL Frank Knight showed up,  wanting to use her shop as a cover for his special ops team. Becky prides  herself on being able to weld and shoot just as well as the big boys. But while  munitions and mayhem are Frank&#39;s way of life, the last thing he needs is Becky  in the way. Yet it&#39;s just his luck when she ends up in a hostage situation.  Come hell or high water, he will get her back...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;em&gt; Rev It  Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ex-SEAL Jake &quot;the Snake&quot; Sommers was known for striking  quickly, quietly, and lethally. That&#39;s also how he broke Michelle Carter&#39;s  heart. It was the only way to keep her safe-from himself. Four years later,  Jake wants another chance, but Michelle has never forgiven him. But when her  brother ticks off a mobster, she must do the unimaginable: place her life in  Jake&#39;s hands. And once she does, he&#39;ll never let her go...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the  facade of their tricked-out motorcycle shop is a covert team comprised of the  most elite ex-military specialists. &lt;em&gt;New  York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Julie Ann Walker has thrilled readers with her sexy  Black Knights, Inc. romantic suspense  series.
