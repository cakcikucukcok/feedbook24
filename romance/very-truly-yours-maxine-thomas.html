  <title>Very Truly Yours - Maxine Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Buddy Madsen set her husband goals too high. Th e man who wins her heart
must gain her familys approval, be a good provider, love her unconditionally, and, most
of all, share her strong faith. David Willoughby, the handsome New York architect who
guest lectures her class, does not meet those goals. But Buddy is attracted to him. She
petitions God to guard her heart, and they go their separate waysshe to the security of
family, he to a marriage that promises social prominence and career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their next meeting several years later, Buddy recognizes positive changes in David.
He has given up his philandering ways. She is delighted with the changes she sees in
him. Perhaps they can develop a permanent relationship after all. Perhaps David can
avoid the devastating consequences of his previous lifestyle. Or perhaps, for them, its
just too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through every phase of their relationship, Buddy and David must choose between
what is right and what is acceptable, what is honorable and what is selfish. But they are
not perfect, and their desire to be together often drives them to take paths that could
sideline their future, and their faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
