          &lt;strong&gt;More Than The House Is Under Construction!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A penthouse condo, the corner office–life was easy for Aaron, the youngest McKade brother, who by his own admission sometimes rode on the coattails of his wealthy family. Until his grandfather exiled him to a job building homes in the barrio of south central L.A., that is. Not knowing the difference between a nail and a screw made things tough–but not nearly as tough as figuring out Jennifer Alvarado, the curvaceous Latina in charge of the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite her suspicion that he&#39;d never done an honest day&#39;s work, Jennifer decided to give Aaron a break. Yet even after the mystery rookie had worked overtime to prove his newfound sense of responsibility, she wasn&#39;t ready to lower her guard. Because Jennifer had learned the hard way that love without trust was a house without a foundation…and too easy to tear down.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The McKade Brothers&lt;/strong&gt;
