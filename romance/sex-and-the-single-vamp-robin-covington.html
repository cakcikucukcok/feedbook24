He&#39;s only loved one woman in over three hundred years- CiCi- and she chose another. So when she shows up in his office asking for help, he finally has the chance to lay that demon to rest. He&#39;ll help her, but for a price-a night in his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;?Adrenaline, mischief, and a little late-night B&amp;E light the passion that even a couple of lifetimes couldn&#39;t put out. But Deacon has a secret and when Cici is suddenly mortal, his deception might be the only way restore her immortality. Can love bridge the gap between a heartbeat and forever?&lt;/p&gt;" />
