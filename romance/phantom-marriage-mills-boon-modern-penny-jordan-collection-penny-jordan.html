  <title>Phantom Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She had weathered life&#39;s storms alone.&lt;/em&gt; Tara had been only seventeen when she&#39;d given herself to James. She had borne him twins in secret, inventing a short-lived marriage to protect her fatherless children and to hide her shame.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The years had brought Tara added wisdom, though time hadn&#39;t dulled the pain of James&#39;s rejection or the aching pleasure of their remembered passion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meeting him again was a shock, but Tara was determined never to let him know the price she had paid in silence for her first and only love.&lt;/p&gt;
