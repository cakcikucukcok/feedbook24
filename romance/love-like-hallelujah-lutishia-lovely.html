      <meta name="description" content="With infidelity behind them, Tai&#39;s marriage to her pastor husband, King, is stronger than ever. Even when King&#39;s ex-lover, Tootie, comes back to town, Tai keeps her cool.  .  .until she hears Tootie has a teenage son no one knew existed--a son who could be King&#39;s. Tai is determined to know who the boy&#39;s father is, and enlists the help of her best friend Vivian to find out the truth. But what they discover is more than either of them ever wanted to know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivian must also deal with the return of her husband&#39;s former assistant, a woman who believes that if it wasn&#39;t for Vivian, she would have been first lady of Kingdom Citizens Christian Center. Millicent&#39;s back too, just in time for the marriage of Hope and Cy, the man she thought she&#39;d be marrying. So what happens when love feels more like harried hell instead of hallelujah?
