  <title>Promise to Defend - Diana Gardin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;No one does Romantic Suspense like Diana Gardin. I was rooting for Ronin and Olive from the very first page.&quot; -- Susan Stoker, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author  &lt;br&gt;A sexy and suspenseful standalone in the Rescue Ops series.&lt;br&gt;  By saving her, he might just save himself...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m broken. I have been for seven years. Ever since my wife was murdered while I was deployed overseas. I was protecting our country, but I should have been protecting her. I haven&#39;t looked at another woman since--but then Olive Alexander crossed my path. She stirs up feelings I thought were long dead. So when her house is ransacked after she receives a threatening message, I know I have to step in and keep her safe. I failed my wife, but I won&#39;t fail Olive. Unfortunately, Olive isn&#39;t exactly ready to accept my help...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  With her sexy-as-sin pencil skirts and sleek ponytails, Olive clearly doesn&#39;t let anything--or &lt;i&gt;anyone--&lt;/i&gt;mess up her perfectly ordered life. But years spent working as a special ops soldier has taught me how to read people... and I know Olive is hiding something. When my covert mission for Night Eagle Security collides with Olive&#39;s past, I&#39;ll have to get her to open up--or risk losing her. And losing Olive is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an option. If she&#39;s in danger, I&#39;ll defend her...even if it costs me my life.&lt;br&gt;" />
