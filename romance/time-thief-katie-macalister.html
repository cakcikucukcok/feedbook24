  <title>Time Thief - Katie MacAlister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
Outcast due to their ability to manipulate time, shunned by the mortal and immortal worlds alike, a Traveller&amp;rsquo;s life is anything but easy.&lt;br /&gt;
Traveller Peter Faa is a member of the Otherworld&amp;rsquo;s Watch tracking down a murderer, and unfortunately, the clues all seem to point toward his own estranged family. Any of his cousins could be guilty, but finding which one is tricky when they&amp;rsquo;re all experts in the art of stealing time.&lt;br /&gt;
After surviving a lightning strike, Kiya Mortenson is determined to get just one thing in her life right. And if that means taking a job as nanny to five pugs who live in a campsite in the Oregon wilderness, then so be it. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that the job comes with some pretty spectacular male eye candy, including her new boss&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous black sheep grandson. If only she didn&amp;rsquo;t keep having this strange sense of deja vu&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
When Peter discovers that his own family is stealing time from Kiya, all bets are off. While she may drive him crazy at times, it&amp;rsquo;s clear to him that it&amp;rsquo;s not just lightning that&amp;rsquo;s creating some serious sparks between them. And he&amp;rsquo;s not going to let secrets, lies, or a devious murderer keep Kiya from where she belongs: at his side.&lt;br /&gt;
