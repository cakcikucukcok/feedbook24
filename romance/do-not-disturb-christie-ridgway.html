      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You can choose your friends, but you can&#39;t choose your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigative reporter Angel Buchanan dug up a whopping surprise: The late &quot;Artist of the Heart&quot; Stephen Whitney -- famous for his family values -- was the father who&#39;d abandoned her when she was four. And there&#39;s nothing like the reading of a will to bring people out of the woodwork, especially relatives you never knew you had...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Such as the grieving widow and her sexpot twin sister...and a hunky man Angel is thrilled to learn is not any kind of cousin at all. He&#39;s C.J. Jones, the legendary lawyer determined to keep her quiet about her late, not-so-great deadbeat dad&#39;s secret life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angel knows he&#39;ll try to woo her into submission, but how can she resist? The setting: Tranquility House, a remote retreat containing plenty of private rooms and romantic hideaways. But how far will C.J. go to get what he wants? And, for that matter, how far will Angel?&lt;/p&gt;" />
