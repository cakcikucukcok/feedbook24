  <title>Houston, We Have A Problem - Erin McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Use As Directed, For As Long As It Takes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Houston Hayes has never had trouble maintaining his professional distance.  .  .until he meets resident Josie Adkins. Every time she drops a chart in his presence, he&#39;s treated to a view that makes him extremely interested in her bones. Jumping them, that is. For a man who prides himself on control at all times, this is a problem.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All her life, Josie has wanted to be a surgeon. But how can she do that while she&#39;s suffering from the debilitating Dr. Hayes Induced Dropping Medical Equipment Syndrome? And then Dr. Hayes prescribes a cure: one night of sheet-burning passion to erase the tension for both of them. But only one night.  .  .he won&#39;t need more than that.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Josie has her mission--a chance to prove to the arrogant Dr. Hayes that one night with her will never be enough. And soon, both doctors may be falling into a desire deeper than any they&#39;ve ever known.  .  ." />
