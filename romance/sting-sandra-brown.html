  <title>Sting - Sandra Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A savvy businesswoman and an assassin struggle to outwit the FBI -- and each other -- in this #1 &lt;i&gt;NYT &lt;/i&gt;bestselling story of sizzling romance and shocking deception from &quot;a masterful storyteller&quot; (&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Jordie Bennet and Shaw Kinnard lock eyes across a disreputable backwater bar, something sparks. Shaw is a man who gives off a dangerous vibe that makes other men stand back and women take notice. No one feels this more strongly than Jordie, a woman who doesn&#39;t belong in a seedy dive on the banks of a bayou. But here she is . . . and Shaw Kinnard is here to kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As Shaw takes aim, Jordie is certain her time has come. Instead, Shaw has other plans. He abducts Jordie, hoping to get his hands on the $30 million her brother has stolen. But he isn&#39;t the only one: Jordie&#39;s brother made a deal with the FBI, but his ruthless boss will stop at nothing to find the money first. Now on the run from the feds and a notorious criminal, Jordie and Shaw must rely on their wits to stay alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Miles away from civilization and surrounded by swampland, Jordie and Shaw play each other against their common enemies. Jordie&#39;s only chance of survival is to outwit Shaw, but he suspects her from the start. Was she in on her brother&#39;s scam, or is she an innocent pawn in this deadly vendetta? And just how valuable is her life to Shaw, her remorseless and manipulative captor? Burning for answers -- and for each other -- this unlikely pair ultimately make a desperate move that could be their last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With nonstop plot twists and the sizzling sexual tension that has made Sandra Brown one of the world&#39;s most beloved authors, &lt;i&gt;Sting&lt;/i&gt; will keep you on the edge of your seat until its final pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;" />
