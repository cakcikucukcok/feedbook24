  <title>Wet Games in the Elevator - Lolly Pope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
After attending a meeting for his company, Drew drives back to the hotel swearing at the weather and his full bladder. He has a reason for not using the bathroom, though. He is horny and plans to have some wet fun in his room. What he didn&amp;rsquo;t expect was get caught by an electrical problem in the elevator with a young woman who also needs to use the bathroom. And it&amp;rsquo;s not long before she has a wet accident right there in the lift.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Drew&amp;rsquo;s mind had just begun fantasizing again when the elevator stopped, its lights blinking a few times. Livia jerked and pulled herself in a corner, catching the holding bars on each side and whimpering. He just looked up at the lights wondering what in the world was going on. There had never been a blackout before at the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fuck! The power&amp;rsquo;s out!&amp;rdquo; he sighed, then he looked at her. &amp;ldquo;Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t be scared, love! It will only take a few minutes!&amp;rdquo; Drew rubbed her arms, not daring to hug her yet. Livia nodded, wide-eyed and pale as a sheet. &amp;ldquo;Are you claustrophobic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just scared of falling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Guess you won&amp;rsquo;t be up for bungee jumping, then.&amp;rdquo; he joked and she laughed, relaxing a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nope.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll be okay, you&amp;rsquo;ll see!&amp;rdquo; Drew added seriously, thinking about his bladder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just to spite them, a male voice spoke through the intercom and told them the situation. &amp;ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm. We are aware of the problem and will try to fix it as soon as possible. However, it may take our handymen around two hours.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Two hours?&amp;rdquo; Livia wailed panicked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two fucking hours? Drew sighed inwardly, his hands still on her arms, rubbing. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna piss in my pants!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, man, I knew I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had that third Cosmopolitan!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She bit her lower lip. Drew looked at her suddenly understanding her fear. So she had a full tank, too. Well, his day just got better, &amp;lsquo;cause if there was something better than fucking, that would be piss fuck. That was the main reason for not unloading his precious gold at the bathroom in the building where they had had the meeting. He preferred enjoying a long session of masturbating and pissing in the shower. He did that a lot. If he could add a woman to that combination, it would be fantastic. The problem was, Livia hadn&amp;rsquo;t said anything about piss fucking." />
