          &lt;strong&gt;An Improper Affair&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As business mogul Ryan Sperling was closing in on his target – his father! – the charismatic bachelor encountered a woman who was unforgettable and forbidden! Could he walk away from his father’s mistress’s daughter?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Married to His Business&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matthias Barton’s dependable assistant was leaving to work for the competition before he realised the betrayal, shock and jealousy he was feeling sprang from personal feelings. He would win her back – by any means necessary!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;In Bed with the Devil Millionaire &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jack arrived at Hunter’s Landing to find his best friend’s shy little sister had become a breathtaking woman intent on luring him into her bed…right across the hall. Would Jack keep a decade-old promise?&lt;/p&gt;
