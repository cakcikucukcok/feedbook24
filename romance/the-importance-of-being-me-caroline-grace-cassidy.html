  <title>The Importance of Being Me - Caroline Grace-Cassidy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Courtney&#39;s husband leaves her for Mar-nee - a local beautician years younger - she&#39;s upset but nowhere near as devastated as she thought she&#39;d be. Her marriage to David hasn&#39;t been great for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that he&#39;s gone, Courtney and her fifteen-year-old daughter, Susan, are left on their own at home. But Susan is a complete daddy&#39;s girl and likes to spend all her weekends in the new modern apartment that Mar-nee owns. Susan still thinks David is the greatest father on earth and Courtney has no intention of ruining that illusion for her daughter. In addition, Susan and Mar-nee have a fantastic relationship. In fact Susan says, they are as close as &#39;sisters&#39;, and constantly refers to the fact that &#39;Mar-nee just gets her.&#39; And, of course, Susan and Mar-nee Snapchat their every waking moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Susan then decides to spend the whole summer with her dad and Mar-nee, Courtney is devastated. She needs a change, and some time for herself. With her grandmother&#39;s legacy, she decides she needs a complete change of scene, on her own, and a work assignment in Cornwall looks like the perfect solution. At least for the summer it&#39;s a new location, new people and a project to keep her busy. Then, when she bumps into a client she&#39;s worked with but never actually met, it&#39;s like being hit by a bolt of lightning. But can she ever have what she wants most in the world: a whole new relationship with the most important person in her life - her daughter?&lt;/p&gt;" />
