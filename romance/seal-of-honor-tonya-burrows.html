  <title>SEAL of Honor - Tonya Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a good thing Gabe Bristow lives and breathes the Navy SEAL credo, &quot;the only easy day was yesterday,&quot; because today, his life is unrecognizable. When his prestigious career comes to a crashing halt, he&#39;s left with a bum leg and few prospects for employment that don&#39;t include a desk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until he&#39;s offered the chance to command a private hostage rescue team and free a wealthy American businessman from Colombian paramilitary rebels. It seems like a good deal--until he meets his new team: a drunk Cajun linguist, a boy-genius CIA threat analyst, an FBI negotiator with mob ties, a cowboy medic, and an EOD expert as volatile as the bombs he defuses. Oh, and who could forget the sexy, frustratingly impulsive Audrey Van Amee? She&#39;s determined to help rescue her brother--or drive Gabe crazy. Whichever comes first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the death toll rises, Gabe&#39;s team of delinquents must figure out how to work together long enough to save the day. Or, at least, not get themselves killed. Because Gabe&#39;s finally found something worth living for, and God help him if he can&#39;t bring her brother back alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the HORNET series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* SEAL of Honor     &lt;br&gt;* Honor Reclaimed     &lt;br&gt;* Broken Honor     &lt;br&gt;* Code of Honor     &lt;br&gt;* Reckless Honor     &lt;br&gt;* Honor Avenged&lt;/p&gt;" />
