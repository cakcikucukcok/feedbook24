      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Liam Wolfson, the professional assassin, is dead. His new persona, Jack Hammerson, lives in a small town in Colorado, happy helping out as many of the townsfolk as he can. It&#39;s his way of working toward some kind of redemption for his sins. Until one night when an amnesiac woman falls into his arms, calling out his old name... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kara remembers nothing about her previous life, only brief glimpses of an old lover and their time together... but she knows her fate is entwined with Liam&#39;s. Then there&#39;s the familiarity with all things Valkyrie and Valhalla. She worries she might be going crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liam has worked hard to hide all traces of his old life, but Kara rips old wounds open as their old feelings for each other come rushing back. But it&#39;s not just Kara who&#39;s come to town looking for answers. When mercenaries arrive looking for Liam, he&#39;ll need Kara to remember what she&#39;s capable of if either of them is going to survive...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Odin&#39;s Bastards series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Her Alpha Viking&lt;br&gt;* Warrior Nights&lt;br&gt;* Warrior in Love&lt;/p&gt;" />
