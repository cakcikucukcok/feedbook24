  <title>The Sins of Our Parents - Anne Drover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jeffrey Coleman and Alison Goodrich, both college juniors when the story begins, are members of two wealthy and influential families from 
Biltmore Forrest, North Carolina.
    	Jeffreys mother traces her family lineage back to ancestors who came to America on the Mayflower and some who were proud participants in the Civil War. Jeffreys dad, a North Carolina state senator, believes his destiny is to become president of the United States. His friend Alisons dad is the successful political force behind him.
   	The lifelong close relationship between Jeffrey and Alison fills the story with wonderful insights into their spiritual and intellectual growth.  Both are determined to help make the world a better place and move beyond what they consider to be the selfish lives their parents have lived. 
     	While Alison remains in Cambridge, Massachusetts, attending Harvard, Jeffrey spends his junior year at Kings College in London, England, where he meets and becomes intimately involved with Ala, a beautiful young woman from Saudi Arabia. Thus begins Jeffreys unwitting journey amid an intricate terrorist plot aimed at wreaking havoc on the United States. The resulting terrorist trial lays bare many of the family secrets of both Coleman and Goodrich family members.
     	This books twists and turns finally draw readers toward an ending that is surprising, poignant, and hopeful." />
