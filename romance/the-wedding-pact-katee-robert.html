  <title>The Wedding Pact - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Katee Robert continues her smoking-hot series about the O&#39;Malleys-wealthy, powerful, and full of scandalous family secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Carrigan O&#39;Malley has always known her arranged marriage would be more about power and prestige than passion. But after one taste of the hard-bodied, whiskey-voiced James Halloran, she&#39;s ruined for anyone else. Too bad James and his family are enemy number 1. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Hallorans vs. O&#39;Malleys-that&#39;s how it&#39;s always been. James should be thinking more about how to expand his family&#39;s empire instead of how silky Carrigan&#39;s skin is against his and how he can next get her into his bed. Those are dangerous thoughts. But not nearly as dangerous as he&#39;ll be if he can&#39;t get what he wants: Carrigan by his side for the rest of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
