  <title>From a Distance - Vernon Bargainer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a Distance is a love story where boy and girl struggle to cope with psychological forces affecting young lovers today. Though their first meeting is filled with intrigue and sweet innocence, their fairytale soon gives way to reality, and the real world proceeds to threaten their love?indeed their lives. It is the tale of a shattered dream and a young womans search to find her purpose in the menacing world around her. It is a harsh test of the powers of confessed, though struggling, love against formidable obstacles. Through it all, the young lovers depend heavily on Mother Nature to give them solace and provide communion and healing for their day-to-day wounds.&lt;br /&gt;In the story, a young bride, Sarah Grace, runs away from tragedy on her wedding night. Days later, she is in hiding in the home of her aunt and uncle where she tries to reckon with her situation and regain her wits. Ultimately, she seeks respite through daily visits to the peaceful meadow near her hideaway. There, she plots a course for regaining her freedom and vows never again to allow romantic love to enter her life.&lt;br /&gt;Early one morning, a young man would stand at the top of the meadow, enraptured by the vision of a woman lolling in the tall grass some 200 yards away. Somehow, he would feel her pain. He would just stand there, immobile, absorbed in her essence. One day they would meet and their love would grow as if destined for eternity. Little did they suspect that by and by, the magic of their fairytale beginning would collapse and they would walk a long, tough, weary road together?one which would take them to the brink of doom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
