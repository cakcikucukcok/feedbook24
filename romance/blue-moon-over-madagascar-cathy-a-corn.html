  <title>Blue Moon over Madagascar - Cathy A. Corn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lilith Devlin is shocked when a faery appears in her Pittsburgh garden and asks her to write a faery novel and perform a mysterious mission. Though the faery promises love, shes paralyzed by fear, for her life of working as a bookstore manager and living in seclusion with her cat will change. She balks until circumstances force her to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away, she flies to Ireland, where Old World faeries fascinate her with their ways. While there, she meets and is strongly attracted to New York editor Adam Kramer, who expresses keen interest in her faery novel. Her romantic hopes are waylaid, however, by his wedding band and female companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, she and Adam land in Antananarivo, Madagascar, to prevent slaughter of endangered lemursthe faery mission. Mystery and romance abound as Lilith and Adam search for lemurs, battle nasty characters, and allow island moonlight and breezes to transport them to a world of passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Moon over Madagascar, first in the Lilith and the Faeries series, can be used as a fictional faery 101, helping you to connect with the faeries and invite them into your life. The next two novels are Smell the Plumerias, set on the Big Island of Hawaii, and Faery: The Final Frontier. &lt;/p&gt;
