  <title>A Christmas of Miracles - Marteeka Karland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Colorado Mountains, a single mom needs to find her Christmas joy, but her salvation may lie with the very man who broke her heart so many years ago.   Christmas always holds surprises... When Lia walks through the door of Aiden&#39;s bed and breakfast, he can&#39;t believe his luck. He&#39;s loved Lia since before he knew what love was.  Not all surprises are welcome... Though Lia knew she was heading straight into Aiden&#39;s arms when she entered the town of Mountain View, Colorado, she had nowhere else to go. The reality of seeing him, however, was a special kind of hell.  A white Christmas and a couple of miracles... With the help of family she never realized loved her so much, maybe Christmas can be turned around. And maybe her heart will break all over again." />
