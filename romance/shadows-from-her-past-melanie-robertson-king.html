  <title>Shadows from Her Past - Melanie Robertson-King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Returned to her life in the year 2010, Sarah Shand discovers she is a patient in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and has been for months. Unable to come to terms with the situation, she insists she belongs in 1886 at Weetshill with her husband the Laird, Robert Robertson, and adopted daughter, Jenny.  Robert, breaks through the time-space continuum and visits Sarah in his future. He pleads with her to return to the past but his cryptic messages only confuse her.  Medical student, David Robb, himself a descendant of the Robertsons of Weetshill, befriends Sarah. Fascinated with her stories of the past, after her release from the hospital, he takes Sarah to meet his parents, the current owners of the mansion and surrounding land.   This year, the winter solstice and lunar eclipse occur on the same day. Will a trip to the stone circle during this combination of events create the magic Sarah needs to return to 1886 and her family there? Or will she remain in the present and make a life with David?" />
