  <title>On the Plus Side - Alison Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Big girls don&#39;t cry--they go after what they want--in this &quot;fresh, fun, adorable&quot; (Lori Wilde) romantic comedy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thanks to her bangin&#39; curves, Valerie Carmichael has always turned heads -- with the exception of seriously sexy Logan Mathis. Just Valerie&#39;s luck that the object of her lust-filled affection is also best friends with her overprotective brother. But Valerie&#39;s determined to get Logan&#39;s attention . . . even if it means telling a &lt;i&gt;teeny&lt;/i&gt; little lie to get a job at his new bar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Logan can&#39;t remember a time when Valerie didn&#39;t secretly fuel all his hottest fantasies. Now the curvaceous she-devil is working behind his bar, tempting him every damn night. It&#39;s only when he finds Valerie&#39;s naughty things-to-do list that Logan decides to break every rule in the book -- by making each red-hot deed a reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  No one warned them that they were going to fall this hard. And no one warned them that sometimes the smallest secrets can have the biggest consequences." />
