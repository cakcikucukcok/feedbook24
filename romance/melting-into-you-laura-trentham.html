  <title>Melting Into You - Laura Trentham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alec Grayson returns home to Falcon, Alabama, to rebuild his life after a knee injury ended his NFL career. As the Falcon high school quarterback coach, Alec&#39;s love for the game is reignited.  Meanwhile, he puts his hard-partying past and the betrayal of the people he trusted most behind him, and adopts a hard demeanor. That is, until a spitfire artist with soulful eyes and a body that haunts his dreams gets under his skin and threatens to crack his armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilliana Hancock is forced to leave her struggling-artist lifestyle in New York and return to Falcon after her father&#39;s unexpected death leaves her a decrepit family mansion. Determined to use her skills to turn the home into a successful bed and breakfast, Lilliana is stopped at every turn by the town contractor, who happens to be Alec, the gorgeous and arrogant jock to whom she lost her virginity in college. Except Alec doesn&#39;t remember, which infuriates her. Too bad she can&#39;t forget the way his body felt against hers or how his heated gaze follows her...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will they be able to put their pasts behind them for a future together?&lt;/p&gt;" />
