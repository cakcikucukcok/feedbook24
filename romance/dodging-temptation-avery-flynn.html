      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can&#39;t hide from love...or revenge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dodge Loving wants revenge...and he&#39;s about to get it. On the cusp of closing a multi-billion-dollar luxury resort deal, Dodge can&#39;t afford for anything go wrong. But then a fiery redhead shows up, the paparazzi hot on her trail, and throws his world into chaos. He has to get rid of her. Immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Conner just wants to be left alone, but after slapping her cheating senator ex-husband during a televised press conference, she&#39;s a hot commodity. The ultra exclusive resort in Wyoming seems like the ideal place to hide-and work-so there&#39;s no way she&#39;s letting the Type-A jerk who runs the place fire her.&lt;br&gt;Despite the animosity sparking between them, Dodge and Harper can&#39;t keep their hands to themselves. This thing between them can&#39;t happen. It won&#39;t. But his mother has other ideas...and she&#39;s willing to do whatever it takes to make sure Harper and Dodge fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
