  <title>The Wedding Party - Robyn Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;After her divorce, Charlene Dugan vowed never to get married again—a promise she has kept for twenty-five years.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until the fateful day she finds herself uttering the well-known phrase—let’s get married! Almost immediately Charlene’s seemingly perfect life begins unraveling at the seams. Daughter Stephanie&#39;s own relationship is about to disintegrate, and she might be just a teensy weensy jealous of her mom.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And Charlene seems to be spending more time with her ex-husband than with her fiancé, Dennis. What’s more confusing is that Dennis doesn’t seem to mind too much. In fact, he sees the wedding consultant more often than Charlene does.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The wedding party is now officially out of control. They&#39;re calling for rain and the bride has cold feet. This isn’t exactly what Charlene had in mind. But maybe it&#39;s not too late to finally decide on who and what she really wants.&lt;/p&gt;
