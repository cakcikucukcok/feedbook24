A lovely message in today's world.<br /><b><i>Her Notorious Viscount (Stoneworth, #1) by Jenna Petersen</i></b> | Her Notorious Viscount was a light and enjoyable read that I would definitely recommend for a lazy weekend afternoon. As an author, Petersen lines up with other historical romance writers like Julia Quinn and Karen Hawkins. Read more. 2 people found this helpful.
