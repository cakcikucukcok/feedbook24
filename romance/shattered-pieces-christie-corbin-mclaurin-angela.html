      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Struggling to mend a broken soul can be more painful than leaving it shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just ask Tori Blair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To most people, Tori has the perfect life. She has a great job, great friends. But looks can be deceiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind closed doors, she battles the demons haunting her from a previous relationship. No matter how hard she tries to break away from the past, it keeps holding her down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandler Ashby thought joining the army to follow in his dad&amp;rsquo;s footsteps was what he wanted. After realizing military life wasn&amp;rsquo;t for him, he left and became a firefighter. A new career in a new city was exactly the fresh start he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a chance encounter reunites him with the high school sweetheart he left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He soon realizes that the carefree girl he once loved is now a woman fighting to overcome fear and anxiety caused by another man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Chandler be able to save Tori from her demons, or will they both go down in the fight?&lt;/p&gt;" />
