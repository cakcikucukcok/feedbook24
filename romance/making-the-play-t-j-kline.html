  <title>Making the Play - T. J. Kline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T.J. Kline launches a brand new series with the charming story of a NFL player who finds love when he least expects it&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant McQuaid has dedicated his entire life to his football career. Now an injury threatens his place on the team and he&amp;#8217;s forced to return home to rehabilitate. But when he meets his &amp;#8220;biggest fan,&amp;#8221; a precocious, blue-eyed, hearing impaired boy named James&amp;#8212;and his beautiful mother, Bethany&amp;#8212;Grant begins to question whether football is the future he still wants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethany Mills has been doing just fine since her husband walked out on them&amp;#8230; and she definitely doesn&amp;#8217;t need another man to disappoint her&amp;#8212;or her son. But when James runs into his hero at the park, Bethany admits there is a void in her son&amp;#8217;s life that she just can&amp;#8217;t fill. Her attraction to the handsome football star is undeniable, but a man in the limelight is the last thing she wants for herself, or James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant doesn&amp;#8217;t want to subject Bethany to the chaos of dating a professional athlete. But the more time he spends with her and James, the harder it is to resist making a play for her heart&amp;#8230; &lt;/p&gt;" />
