  <title>Asking for Trouble - Amy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After three years in Credence trying to fade into the background, Della Munroe is sick of being invisible. She&#39;s ready to take back control. To live a little. Hell, she&#39;s ready to see what this dating fuss is all about. And if that means she has to download Tinder and date every guy in Colorado, then she&#39;s up for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After her first disastrous attempt, she decides navigating online dating would be better with a wingman, and there&#39;s no better person for it than Tucker Daniels. After all, he is a man. And he owns a bar, which practically makes him a relationship expert. He&#39;s also her older brother&#39;s best friend. Yes, she may have the teeniest tiny inconvenient crush on him, but he&#39;s always had her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tucker Daniels would rather eat broken glass than watch Della go out with a bunch of douchebag dudes only out for one thing. Unfortunately, he&#39;s never been able to say no to her, and before he knows it, Tucker&#39;s not only vetting her dates--he&#39;s teaching her to drive, helping her move out, and buying her a puppy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Della wants him to tutor her in more intimate arts, he freaks out. Because this little sister is strictly off-limits, and saying yes to Della is asking for a whole lot of trouble. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Credence, Colorado series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Nothing But Trouble&lt;br&gt;* The Trouble with Christmas&lt;br&gt;* Asking for Trouble&lt;/p&gt;" />
