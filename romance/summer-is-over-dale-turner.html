  <title>Summer Is Over - Dale Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SYNOPSIS OF SUMMER IS OVER
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sara is a single mother of a soon to be teenage daughter, Jarra. Although it is nearly thirteen years since her hippie restless husband left her when she was pregnant with Jarra and has never contributed to her upkeep, or kept in touch, she has never been able to forget the love they shared or allow another man into her heart.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Sara feels like there is a brick wall stopping her from loving again, and although she has had a few boyfriends and now Glen, a young Doctor, who she works with and she knows she cares for, she finds it hard to let him into her heart.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Unexpectedly Jarra discovers her fathers email address and Sara agrees to let her contact him and then invite him to stay with them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Marsh stirs all the old memories and feelings up in her, and tells her to live for today and not worry about good jobs and good educations for her daughter.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      Will she follow Marsh and be hurt again or will she see sense and let Glen into her heart." />
