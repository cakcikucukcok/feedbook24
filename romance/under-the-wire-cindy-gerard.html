  <title>Under the Wire - Cindy Gerard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Manny Ortega is a man without a country, and he has one woman to thank for it. She was his first and only true love, and when she left, she took more than his heart--she took his life as he knew it. Hardened and honed sharp as a knife by years as a special forces soldier and police detective, Manny is ready for a fresh start at his friend Ethan Garrett&#39;s security firm. But the past isn&#39;t ready to let him go...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily Campora never imagined what would happen to Manny after she walked away from him that night in the sultry Nicaraguan heat--or how he&#39;d hated her for it every day since. Seventeen years later, Lily knows everything, and she must put her fear of Manny&#39;s rage aside to beg for his help. His forgiveness may be too much to hope for...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrust into action on a mission that will transport them to a country rife with political turmoil and civil unrest, Manny and Lily must find a way to work together. And now, amidst the dangerous beauty of a landscape reminiscent of Manny&#39;s homeland, passion will ignite once more...&lt;/p&gt;" />
