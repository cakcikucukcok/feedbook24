  <title>72 Hours - Bella Jewel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A red-hot, pulse-pounding thrill ride by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bella Jewel! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all part of his sick game. A game he&#39;s been planning for an entire decade. Now everything is perfect: One woman and one man have been selected. They used to be a couple--and they can no longer stand one another. They are the perfect victims. He doesn&#39;t intend for the game to be easy. He wants to push them to the brink of insanity, to make his hunt real. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara and Noah have been captured and dumped into a massive wooded area. There&#39;s only one rule in this fatal game: They will have 72 hours to find a way out before a sadistic serial killer begins his hunt . . .But what he never could have expected was the explosive passion that ignites between the two ex-lovers--one that makes them strong. Fierce. And determined to do whatever it takes to escape--and to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;72 Hours &lt;/i&gt;by Bella Jewel is a sexy, page-turning thrill ride!&lt;/p&gt;" />
