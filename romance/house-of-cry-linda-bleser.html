      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this page-turning magical adventure in the spirit of &lt;em&gt;The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells&lt;/em&gt;, a secret room in a new house transports a woman to alternate realities of her life&amp;#8212;spiritual voyages of discovery that offer unexpected answers about her family, herself, and her true destiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Jenna Hall&amp;#8217;s thirteen birthday, her mother committed suicide, a tragedy that continues to haunt the young woman twenty years later. Now, on her thirty-third birthday, Jenna&amp;#8217;s pain over her mother&amp;#8217;s death and abandonment is tempered by her hopes for a brighter future&amp;#8212;of a happier life in the new home she&amp;#8217;s buying with her beloved sister, Cassie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While touring the house, Jenna finds a secret room&amp;#8212;a portal that magically transports her to an alternate reality in which her mother is still alive. It is the first of many alternate existences Jenna will experience in which she discovers a different version of herself and the people she knows, both the living and the dead. Accompanying her on these mystical journeys is her ever-present guardian angel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traveling through these alternate realities, Jenna uncovers a long lost sibling, learns about her mother&#39;s past, reconnects with a childhood best friend, and meets her soul mate. Ultimately, she discovers newfound courage, confidence, forgiveness, and love&amp;#8212;for herself, those around her, and those who are gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enchanting and thoughtful, &lt;em&gt;House of Cry&lt;/em&gt; explores the consequences of our daily choices and the power they have to shape our lives, reaffirming our faith in restoration and the possibility of personal transformation. &lt;/p&gt;" />
