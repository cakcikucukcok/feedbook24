  <title>Four Weddings and a Fireman - Jennifer Bernard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It takes a certain kind of man to stand out among the Bachelor Firemen of San Gabriel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefighter Derek &quot;Vader&quot; Brown is one of a kind&amp;#8212;six feet of solid muscle with the heart of a born hero. It&#39;s that protective streak that has him pursuing a promotion to Captain to pay for his mother&#39;s home care. And it&#39;s why he intends to figure out why his sometime girlfriend Cherie Harper runs hot as hellfire one minute and pushes him away the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherie&#39;s got it bad. Vader sweeps her off her feet&amp;#8212;literally&amp;#8212;and their chemistry is combustible. There&#39;s just the little problem of a nightmare from her past she was desperate to escape. And then her sister Trixie arrives, causing havoc for Cherie and the male population of San Gabriel. Cherie doesn&#39;t want her past to complicate Vader&#39;s life or his career. But there&#39;s nothing like a firefighter to break through all your defenses, one smoldering kiss at a time . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
