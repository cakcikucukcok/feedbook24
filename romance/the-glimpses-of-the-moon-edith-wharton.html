  <title>The Glimpses of the Moon - Edith Wharton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in the 1920s, „Glimpses of the Moon” details the romantic misadventures of Nick Lansing and Susy Branch, a couple with the right connections but not much in the way of funds. They are in love and decide to marry, but realize their chances of happiness are slim without the wealth and society that their more privileged friends take for granted. Nick and Susy agree to separate when either encounters a more eligible proposition. Their conditional marriage begins to falter as Susy grows jealous of her husband’s attentions to a wealthy young woman and Nick becomes increasingly disgruntled by the moral compromises arising from his wife’s social negotiations. An expertly drawn portrait of two young lovers, caught between bright-eyed passion and the bitter allure of wealth." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Glimpses of the Moon - Edith Wharton</i></b> | The Glimpses of the Moon by Edith Wharton opens with the Susy Branch, an American socialite, coming up with a clever idea to live as a wealthy woman. She proposes to a struggling writer, Nick Lansing and tells him that they can live in rich houses for a year as a honeymoon gift from her moneyed friends while he works on his first novel.<br /><b><i>The Glimpses of the Moon: Wharton, Edith: 9781519275769 ...</i></b> | The Glimpses of the Moon was Edith Wharton's first novel published after The Age of Innocence, her Pulitzer Prize winner. So, even though I had never heard of it, I read it because she was so at the top of her game at the time that I thought it might be a wonderful rediscovery.<br /><b><i>The Glimpses of the Moon by Edith Wharton - Goodreads</i></b> | The Glimpses of the Moon, set in the early 1920s, is one of Edith Wharton's lesser-known but hugely entertaining novels, and again Wharton reeled me in right from the get-go. Social position &amp; money v. poverty; true v. useful friends; expediency v. self-respect; love v. practical arrangements.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Glimpses of the Moon - Edith Wharton</a> </h3></p><hr/>
