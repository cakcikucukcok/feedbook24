  <title>The Montoros Dynasty (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Janice Maynard, Katherine Garbera, Andrea Laurence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;The Montoros Dynasty&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minding Her Boss’s Business by Janice Maynard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diplomat Alex Ramon’s Miami mission is to convince the exiled Montoros to give up their American life and return to Alma’s throne. But his trusted aide Maria Ferro is flirting with a potential prince and Alex is actually jealous! So jealous, he might sabotage his goals so he can take Maria to his bed. But Alex doesn’t know that Maria has a crush of her own – and it isn’t on the playboy prince…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrying A King’s Child by Katherine Garbera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destined to become king of his family’s ancestral homeland, hotshot Miami businessman Rafe Montoro needs a break. A night with Key West bartender Emily Fielding is just the ticket – until weeks later, when she shows up pregnant! Will Rafe have to choose between love and country after all?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seduced by the Spare Heir by Andrea Laurence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infamous playboy Gabriel Montoro has been announced as heir to the throne – and he’s asked ex-model Serafia Espina to school him in social etiquette. But it’s soon clear that Gabriel’s intentions are entirely against royal protocol&lt;/p&gt;
