  <title>Billionaire in Her Bed - Regina Kyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Steamy with a side of sass - I loved The Billionaire in Her Bed!&quot; - &lt;i&gt;NYT&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author, Jennifer Probst &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Real estate mogul Eli Ward hasn&#39;t had the best of luck lately-someone keeps stealing projects out from under him. So, with his new project, he&#39;s keeping a low profile. Plus, he&#39;s anticipating a fight from the somewhat eclectic folks currently living in the building. What he wasn&#39;t anticipating was that the fight would be led by Brooke Worthington, the woman who absolutely rocked his world one unforgettable night. She might be the only woman in the city who doesn&#39;t know who he is, which is refreshing...and tempting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Graphic designer and part-time bartender Brooke Worthington is not interested in following her family&#39;s plan for her. But she is interested in sharing a drink...and more...with a sexy stranger in a suit when her shift ends. The last thing she expects is to run into him again a few days later at a neighborhood meeting. Eli is hot, really hot, but she can&#39;t afford distractions now that she has to save her building from some greedy real estate billionaire. Only, staying away isn&#39;t as easy as she thought, especially when she learns exactly who Eli really is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
