      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey &lt;/em&gt;meets &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;-&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews &lt;/em&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Against the Ropes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ray wraps his arms around me and holds me tight as if something terrible has happened and he doesn&#39;t want to let me go. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full Contact. This is how Ray speaks when his emotions overwhelm him. I melt into his stillness. His body is hot and hard, his breath warm on my neck. He smells of leather and sweat, sex and sin. Nothing can tear me away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you can&#39;t resist the one person who could destroy you...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sia O&#39;Donnell can&#39;t help but push the limits. She secretly attends every underground MMA fight featuring The Predator, the undisputed champion. When he stalks his prey in the ring, Sia is mesmerized. He is dominant and dangerous and every instinct tells her to run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every beautiful thing Ray &quot;The Predator&quot; touches he knows he&#39;ll eventually destroy. Soft, sweet and innocent, Sia is the light to Ray&#39;s darkness-and completely irresistible. From the moment he lays eyes on her, he knows he&#39;s going to have to put his dark past behind him to win her body and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redemption Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Against the Ropes &lt;br&gt; In Your Corner &lt;br&gt;Full Contact &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Sarah Castille&#39;s Redemption series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Smart, sharp, sizzling and deliciously sexy.&quot;-Alison Kent, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Powerful.
