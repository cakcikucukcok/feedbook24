  <title>Kindergarten Cupids (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Vivienne Wallington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;It was betrayal of the worst kind. Her husband. His wife. A clandestine affair that had torn apart their families and left them to pick up the pieces–after a tragic accident revealed the scandalous truth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Widow and widower. Neither wanted anything to do with each other, but their sons had been best friends…before….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, Mardi Sinclair was financially strapped with a son and grandfather to care for, and Cain Templar was struggling as a single dad. Out of the needs of their young sons, they married. But would their own adult yearnings force them to realize that perhaps this union was the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; love of a lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;
