  <title>At the Spy&#39;s Pleasure - Tina Gabrielle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find thrills and sexy chills in Scandalous&#39;s latest historical romance...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Every gentleman has his secrets...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;London 1821&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years of marriage to a selfish man who preferred gambling to his young bride, Jane, the widowed countess of Stanwell, now seeks what she was long denied-a satisfying lover. Naturally, a lady needs a list of eligible candidates, which doesn&#39;t include the dangerously handsome (if far too arrogant) Gareth Ramsey...until he steals a sinful kiss from Jane&#39;s all-too-willing lips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reputed as an arrogant barrister, Gareth&#39;s real occupation is as a spy in the service of His Majesty, and his suspect is on Jane&#39;s list of possible lovers. With her life in danger, there&#39;s no safer place for Jane than with him-and in his bed. But Jane is as distracting as she is infuriating, and keeping her by his side while he pursues his mission might just endanger them both...&lt;/p&gt;" />
