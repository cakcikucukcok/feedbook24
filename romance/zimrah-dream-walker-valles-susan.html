  <title>Zimrah Dream Walker - Valles Susan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Married to the man of her dreams and finally about to be adopted by the father who raised her, Zimrah should be completely satisfied with her life. But one thing still plagues her...the mystery of where she comes from.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
As she and her husband, Theophilus, journey to Jerusalem to make her adoption official, they meet quite a few people along the way: bandits, a centurion, a mystery man from Nazareth, a Pharisee named Saul, and a woman who may hold all the answers Zimrah has been searching for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
As she learns about her past, Theophilus is focused on building their future. But when they settle into their new home, Zimrah struggles to feel at peace, cut off from anything familiar and unable to hear Yahweh&amp;#39;s voice. The Tormentors have returned, and not even her music can pull her out of the darkness. The only light she sees is in following the stories of the man from Nazareth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
When he appears to her in a dream, calling her to follow him, she will have to choose between remaining in the city of darkness with Theophilus or following Yeshua into the unknown. Theophilus faces challenges of his own, and when Zimrah&amp;#39;s songs of prophecy and praise begin to stir up the people of Capernaum, he may not be there to rescue her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Her music has captured the attention of the Pharisees, who will stop at nothing to silence her. As the tide begins to turn against Yeshua, Zimrah, armed with only her lyre, and with the help of her angels, must once again find the courage to follow Yahweh, even if it costs her everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
