      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seduce Me at Sunrise&lt;/i&gt;, the second book in the Hathaways series by beloved author Lisa Kleypas. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kev Merripen has longed for the beautiful, well-bred Winnifred Hathaway ever since her family rescued him from the brink of death when he was just a boy. But this handsome Gypsy is a man of mysterious origins--and he fears that the darkness of his past could crush delicate, luminous Win. So Kev refuses to submit to temptation...and before long Win is torn from him by a devastating twist of fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, Win returns to England...only to find that Kev has hardened into a man who will deny love at all costs. Meantime, an attractive, seductive suitor has set his sights on Win. It&#39;s now or never for Kev to make his move. But first, he must confront a dangerous secret about his destiny--or risk losing the only woman he has lived for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
