  <title>Recaptured Dreams - Justine Dell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ten years, the Atlantic Ocean, and several rungs in society have kept Xavier Cain from having Sophia Montel. Now twenty-seven, he&#39;s spent his entire adult life building a fashion empire that could finally prove his worth to her family. When fate reunites him with Sophia at London&#39;s premiere fashion show, one problem lodges in Xavier&#39;s path: Sophia doesn&#39;t remember him.  The only obstacle that has kept Sophia from Xavier is a horrific car crash that erased her memory at seventeen. She&#39;s spent the last ten years fighting to reclaim a sliver of her past that her mother refuses to help her remember. When Sophia meets Xavier at the London show, however, all her fantasies come to life in one night of passion. Discovering he is the missing link, she is determined to find all the pieces to their love story and her memory.  Xavier wants forever. Sophia wants her memory. If they take this chance, they&#39;ll have to start over. How far are they willing to go to get what they want? And when the past catches up to them, can they handle the truths it has hidden?" />
