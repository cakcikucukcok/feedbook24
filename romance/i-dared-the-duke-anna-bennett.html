  <title>I Dared the Duke - Anna Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DARE TO FALL IN LOVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Savage, the Duke of Blackshire, is known throughout the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; for three things: the burn scars on his neck, his ornery disposition, and the trail of broken hearts behind him. None of which would concern Miss Elizabeth Lacey in the least--if she weren&#39;t living under his roof. As his grandmother&#39;s companion, Beth is all too concerned with the moody and compelling duke. Incensed by his plans to banish the sweet dowager duchess to the country, Beth refuses to do his bidding. If Alex wants her help, he&#39;s going to have to take her dare...and grant her three wishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Alex adores his grandmother, which is precisely why she must leave. A string of unfortunate incidents has him worried for the safety of everyone around him--including the dowager&#39;s loyal and lovely companion, Beth. But the notorious wallflower isn&#39;t as meek as she appears, and as their battle of wills heats up, so does Alex&#39;s desire. He&#39;s dangerously close to falling in love with her...and revealing secrets he&#39;d rather keep hidden. How can he convince her that his darkest days are behind him--and that, for the first time in forever, his heart is true? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Dared the Duke &lt;/i&gt;continues Anna Bennett&#39;s Regency-era romance series, The Wayward Wallflowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&#39;t miss the &lt;i&gt;Wayward Wallflower &lt;/i&gt;books by Anna Bennett! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My Brown-Eyed Earl (Book 1) &lt;br&gt;I Dared the Duke (Book 2) &lt;br&gt;The Rogue is Back in Town (Book 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Reviewers are saying: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; &quot;Sharply drawn characters, clever dialogue...simmering sensuality.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A new favorite among romance enthusiasts!&quot; - &lt;i&gt;BookPage &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;I Dared the Duke&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Will truly win readers&#39; hearts.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews Top Pick &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;I Dared the Duke &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Bennett brings new life to traditional Regency stories and characters. &quot; - &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;I Dared the Duke&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
