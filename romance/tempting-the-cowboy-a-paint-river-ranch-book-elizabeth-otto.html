      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tempting the Cowboy: A Paint River Ranch Book by Elizabeth Otto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After taking a job on a quiet Montana dude ranch, ex-cop Rylan Frederickson finds herself surrounded by unbelievably sexy cowboys. Too bad the one she wants is her boss...and the single dad of a four-year-old. It doesn&#39;t matter anyway, because after a recent tragedy, there&#39;s simply no more room in her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Letting a new woman into their life is the last thing Cole Haywood wants for him and his daughter, Birdie. But as Rylan&#39;s presence at Paint River Ranch breathes new life into his family he can&#39;t ignore his growing attraction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the sparks between them turn into fireworks in bed, Rylan&#39;s torn between the family she&#39;s lost and the one she may have found. Now she must decide if something that feels this good is worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;" />
