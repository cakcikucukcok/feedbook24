  <title>Fallen Angel (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (The Anne Mather Collection) - Anne Mather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Mills &amp; Boon are excited to present The Anne Mather Collection – the complete works by this classic author made available to download for the very first time! These books span six decades of a phenomenal writing career, and every story is available to read unedited and untouched from their original release.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;An unexpected complication!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jason Tarrant doesn’t want a teenage boy foisted upon him. And he wants it even less when the boy turns out to be artless – and decidedly female – Alex Durham. His estancia in South America is definitely no place for someone as naïve and beautiful as Alex. And when an irresistible attraction develops between them, the situation is soon completely out of hand!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Could it be anything other than sheer infatuation? And was there any way they could avoid real disaster?!&lt;/p&gt;
