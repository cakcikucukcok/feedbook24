  <title>Night Games - Crystal Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over time, the Magickals have learned to live in the company of humans and keep their extraordinary abilities a secret.  But despite their vigilance, one lurks among them who will stop at nothing to obtain his dark desire.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A cop with the Seattle P.D., Selina Grayson is committed to both her job and her privacy. Few know that she&#39;s a centuries&#39; old elf with a tragic past that continues to haunt her. Yet her body still craves the exquisite ecstasy of sex that is her birthright--and a night of complete sensual abandon is just what she needs.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Special Agent with the FBI Magickal Crimes Unit, Jack Laramie is one of the few Normals who know Magickals exist. He&#39;s wary of their power, but one touch from Selina ignites a fire within his blood. Hot with desire, he&#39;s ready to succumb to her erotic spell. But working a serial killer case together isn&#39;t quite as pleasurable--especially when the killer has a taste for humans like Jack. Now one wrong move could put out their heat for eternity.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for the novels of Crystal Jordan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;There are books you read and those very special ones you devour.  .  .&lt;i&gt;Carnal Desires&lt;/i&gt; is definitely one of the latter. This is definitely an author to watch.&quot; --Kate Douglas, author of &lt;i&gt;Wolf Tales &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The author is a master world builder and the abundant sex scenes complement the plot and characters. One cannot help but fall in love with these large, dangerous, hot cats!&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times &lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;On The Prowl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING! This is a REALLY HOT book. (Sexually Explicit)&lt;/b&gt;" />
