  <title>Maybe I Do - Nicole McLaughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Nicole &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;McLaughlin is a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; wonderfully fresh voice in contemporary romance--sweet, sexy, and immensely satisfying.&quot;--Lauren Layne,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;She doesn&#39;t believe in fairy tales.

Maybe whiskey is the secret ingredient that will bring them together--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and give true love a shot?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wedding photographer Charlotte Linley loves her work--even though she hates weddings. Sure, she still holds a grudge after being left at the altar by her high-school sweetheart. But today Charlotte is just happy to have complete control over her career, which is flourishing. Especially since she joined forces with one of the three gorgeous owners of The Stag, a boutique distillery that has become Kansas City&#39;s hottest wedding venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dean Troyer, bitter after the end of his own marriage, knows that Charlotte is the real deal--beautiful, talented, and successful. He may flirt with her every time she comes to The Stag but Dean is determined to keep his professional distance. . .particularly now that she&#39;s helping him with his own sister&#39;s wedding. The only problem? The more time Dean spends with Charlotte, the deeper their connection grows. Is this a rom-com cliché or could it be that these two jaded souls in the wedding business have finally found their real-life happily ever after?&lt;/p&gt;" />
