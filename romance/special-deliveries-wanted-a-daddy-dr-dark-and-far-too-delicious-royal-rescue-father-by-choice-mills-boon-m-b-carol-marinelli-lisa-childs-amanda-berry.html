  <title>Special Deliveries: Wanted: A Daddy: Dr. Dark and Far Too Delicious / Royal Rescue / Father by Choice (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Carol Marinelli, Lisa Childs, Amanda Berry</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Dark and Far Too Delicious&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jasmine Phillips is proving that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; life after divorce and it’s busy! There simply isn’t room in the E.R. nurse and single mum’s day for an attraction to Dr Jed Devlin.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jasmine’s re-built her heart, as well as her life, but can she risk it crumbling again in the hands of this oh-so delicious doc? Living in the same town, working at the same hospital, the temptation is getting harder to resist…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Royal Rescue&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hidden away for more than fourteen years, Thea James was presumed dead by most—killed in the fire that burned the royal palace. But Ronin Parrish knows the truth…and so does the person who murdered Thea’s father, the king. Ronin takes his new duty as Thea’s bodyguard seriously. After all, she’s the only one who can clear his father of the king’s murder. It doesn’t matter that the princess’s beauty and strength draw him to her. To a commoner like him, she can never be more than a mission. Now he’s in a race to restore the princess to her rightful place on the throne before the unknown killer prematurely ends her reign.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Father by Choice&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A family was the last thing workaholic Brady Ward had ever planned on. So after eight years abroad, he was shocked when a blast from his passionate past walked into his office—and informed him that he was a daddy. Now he was faced with a choice: to keep climbing the ladder of success, or build a life with the daughter he left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maggie Brown wanted their little girl to know her father, but bringing a man as ambitious as Brady into their lives is a huge risk, one she wasn&#39;t sure she should take for Amber or herself. Because even after eight years, he still got her heart racing like no one else. Yet would he really give up the corporate lifestyle in the big city for life in a sleepy small town? Maybe if he realized that family was a gift that only came along once in a lifetime….&lt;/p&gt;
