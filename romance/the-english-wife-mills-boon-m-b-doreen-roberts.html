  <title>The English Wife (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Doreen Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He left her a cottage in England…and a photograph with the words &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; written on it…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marjorie Maitland was used to a certain routine–she&#39;d built her life around the safety of predictability. Then the unexpected happened–her husband died. But grief was not the only emotion that overwhelmed her. The mystery her husband left behind puzzled her–a deed to a cottage in England. Where had that come from? And who was the woman in the photograph? Margie knew trouble when it knocked on her door.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The old Margie, safe in her suburban home, would have avoided this potentially humiliating situation. But things were changing. The new Margie had to unravel this tangled web and get to the truth. And that meant a trip to England to find out if her entire life had been a lie…or to discover the best parts of the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
