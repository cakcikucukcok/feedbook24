  <title>Christmas On His Ranch: Maggie&#39;s Dad / Cattleman&#39;s Choice (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Diana Palmer</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Maggie&#39;s Dad&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hot-tempered rancher Powell Long had once stolen Antonia Haye&#39;s heart. But small-town lies tore their young love apart, forcing Antonia to flee.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Years later, she&#39;s returned to find Powell raising a daughter alone. Fatherhood hasn&#39;t tempered his wild side, or his feelings for the one woman he&#39;s always wanted–Antonia.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not even her pride could make her ignore the eager pull of her heartstrings. And taking a chance at a future family with Powell was simply too irresistible….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Cattleman’s Choice&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Carson Wayne had come to Mandelyn Bush with the ultimate request: he needed her to teach him how to treat a lady. No doubt he&#39;d asked the right person—Mandelyn was as polished and feminine as Carson was rough and reclusive. And she was the only person who could reason with him during one of his barroom brawls.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was too intriguing a challenge to turn down. Mandelyn was curious about what lay beneath the outlaw&#39;s hard shell. She suspected that the renegade was really a caring and sensitive man.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But what she hadn&#39;t counted on were her own feelings for this irresistible rebel.&lt;/p&gt;
