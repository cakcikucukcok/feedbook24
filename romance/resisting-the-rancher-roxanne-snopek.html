  <title>Resisting the Rancher - Roxanne Snopek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She&#39;s his best friend&#39;s sister, but he&#39;s ready to break all the rules...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Country veterinarian Celia Gamble is in trouble. A misunderstanding from her past is rearing its ugly head and the only person she can turn to is Jonah Clarke--her family&#39;s lawyer and, as it turns out, her brother&#39;s best friend and her childhood crush. She always wanted Jonah to see her as a bona fide woman, but as a woman who&#39;s being blackmailed for seducing a married man? Not on her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah is happy to help Little CeeCee Gamble, if only she&#39;d come clean about why she&#39;s being blackmailed. But with his best friend Zach&#39;s wedding on the horizon, and Zach&#39;s fashionista fiancée Desiree giving CeeCee a makeover, the little duckling Jonah remembers is turning into a definite swan. And the unwritten law on sisters is clear--hands off. Jonah must resist or lose the only true family he&#39;s ever known.&lt;/p&gt;" />
