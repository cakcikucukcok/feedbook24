  <title>If Santa Were a Cowboy - Melissa Cutler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friends turn into something more when they work as Santa and his elf helper in this charming Christmas story from Melissa Cutler.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Savage loves Christmas at Briscoe Ranch Resort, when he gets to take a break from being a back country guide to play Santa in the resort&#39;s lobby and talk to kids about toys. The last thing he expects is his high school crush to come waltzing in as his new assistant photographer, wheeling a suitcase that&#39;s more naughty than nice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Walker is a disaster. All she&#39;d wanted was to spice up her life by saying &#39;yes&#39; to every opportunity, which is when the universe started pelting her with &#39;no&#39;s.&#39; So when she comes across a job listing for a holiday photographer working with the sweet, scrawny boy whose advances she&#39;d laughed off in high school, she jumps on the chance to turn her bad Karma around by giving Paul a second chance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, Paul&#39;s anything but scrawny anymore, and his cowboy swagger throws her grand plans for a loop--especially when he tempts her with a red hot proposition of his own. Kelly&#39;s in way over her head, but as she gets  swept up in the magic of Briscoe Ranch&#39;s holiday charms--and Paul&#39;s--could Kelly&#39;s year of &#39;no&#39;s&#39; be leading up to the &#39;yes&#39; of a lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;" />
