He&#39;s willing to do whatever it takes to infiltrate the lair of his arms-dealing enemy--and rescue the mother he never knew. To do this, he&#39;ll need more than his father&#39;s fortunes or his brothers-in-arms.He must find a way to kidnap his enemy&#39;s daughter for leverage. There&#39;s just one problem: She is also one of Wolf&#39;s closest friends--and the only woman he&#39;s ever loved...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Olivia de Santis has been waiting for Wolf to take her in his arms and make her dreams come true. But she never imagined that he&#39;d sneak into her bedroom one night...and take her as his hostage. Olivia knows she should resist him--and stay loyal to her own family. But how can she deny the burning justice of Wolf&#39;s mission, and the blazing desire in his eyes--even if giving into the heat of the moment can put her in grave danger? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jackie Ashenden&#39;s novels are:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Sexy, emotional.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--Laurelin Paige, &lt;i&gt;New YorkTimes&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Tantalizing . . . explosive.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review) on &lt;i&gt;Mine to Take&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
