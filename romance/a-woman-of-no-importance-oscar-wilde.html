  <title>A Woman of No Importance -  Oscar Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oscar Wilde&amp;#39;s audacious drama of social scandal centres around the revelation of Mrs Arbuthnot&amp;#39;s long-concealed secret. A house party is in full swing at Lady Hunstanton&amp;#39;s country home, when it is announced that Gerald Arbuthnot has been appointed secretary to the sophisticated, witty Lord Illingworth. Gerald&amp;#39;s mother stands in the way of his appointment, but fears to tell him why, for who will believe Lord Illingworth to be a man of no importance?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oscar Fingal O&amp;#39;Flahertie Wills Wilde was an Irish playwright, poet and author of numerous short stories and one novel. Known for his biting wit, and a plentitude of aphorisms, he became one of the most successful playwrights of the late Victorian era in London, and one of the greatest celebrities of his day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Several of his plays continue to be widely performed, especially The Importance of Being Earnest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the result of a widely covered series of trials, Wilde suffered a dramatic downfall and was imprisoned for two years hard labour after being convicted of &amp;quot;gross indecency&amp;quot; with other men. After Wilde was released from prison he set sail for Dieppe by the night ferry. He never returned to Ireland or Britain, and died in poverty." />
