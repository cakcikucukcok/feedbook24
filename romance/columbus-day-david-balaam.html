  <title>Columbus Day - David Balaam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It’s a well-paced story of life and hope after loss and despair. An ordinary man living an ordinary life until he loses it all, or so he thinks.
George Morton has lost everything. His wife, Aimee, was killed by a drunk driver.
Deciding there is nothing left for him in England, George buys an old farmhouse in Spain.
He meets the attractive Maria, and her not so agreeable papa, Vincente.
He settles down to a new way of life, but not forgetting his lovely Aimee. 
Someone however is not forgetting him. Oliver Barnes of Barnes &amp; Barnes International Bankers, whom George worked for. Oliver is convinced George has the banks money and is determined to retrieve it.
As George becomes closer to Maria, she too wants to start a new chapter in her life, either with or without her father&#39;s consent. 
World Music is paramount in George&#39;s life, and he sets about rediscovering these senses once more, and enjoying adventures along the way, which all culminate on Columbus Day" />
