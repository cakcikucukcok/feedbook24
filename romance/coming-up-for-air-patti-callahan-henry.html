  <title>Coming Up for Air - Patti Callahan Henry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the coast of Alabama, there is a house cloaked in mystery, a place that reveals the truth and changes lives...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellie Calvin is caught in a dying marriage, and she knows this. With her beloved daughter away at college and a growing gap between her and her husband - between her reality and the woman she wants to be - she doesn&#39;t quite seem to fit into her own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everything changes after her controlling mother, Lillian, passes away. Ellie&#39;s world turns upside down when she sees her ex-boyfriend, Hutch, at her mother&#39;s funeral and learns that he is in charge of a documentary that involved Lillian before her death. He wants answers to questions that Ellie&#39;s not sure she can face, until, in the painful midst of going through her mother&#39;s things, she discovers a hidden diary - and a window onto stories buried long ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ellie and Hutch start speaking for the first time in years, Ellie&#39;s closed heart slowly begins to open. Fighting their feelings, they set out together to dig into Lillian&#39;s history. Using both the diary and a trip to the Summer House, a mysterious and seductive bayside home, they gamble that they can work together and not fall in love again. But in piecing together a decades-old unrequited-love story, they just might uncover the secrets in their own hearts...&lt;/p&gt;" />
