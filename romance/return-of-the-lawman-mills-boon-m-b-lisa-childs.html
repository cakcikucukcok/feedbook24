      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Dylan Matthews had left Winter Falls a young man rocked by tragedy; he returned a seasoned big-city cop with a dangerous case to solve and scars that were still too tender to share.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lindsey Warner couldn&#39;t deny that she still wanted Dylan–had never stopped wanting him. But she was a woman now, a successful investigative reporter, and she hadn&#39;t come home to relive the past. No, if she was going to survive another encounter with Dylan Matthews, then she&#39;d have to stick to getting her story and getting out…before she got in over her head.&lt;/p&gt;
