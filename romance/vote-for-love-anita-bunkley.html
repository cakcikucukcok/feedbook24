And signing businessman-turned-politician Dwayne Hunter could &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; launch her agency into the big time. But Dwayne is giving her a run for her money. The arrogant, charismatic candidate for Texas state senate acts like he doesn&#39;t need anyone! Trina knows she&#39;s got to soften his harsh edges. She &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; knows she&#39;s playing a dangerous game&amp;hellip;especially when Dwayne unleashes his potent blend of take-charge masculinity and tender sensuality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Though the price of politics may be her heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dwayne learned about love the hard way and isn&#39;t ready to trust another woman. But Trina&#39;s not just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; woman. With her by his side, he knows he could go far&amp;mdash;on and off the campaign trail. But mixing politics and passion could derail his career&amp;hellip;especially when the power plays&amp;mdash;and scandals&amp;mdash;start flying. And now a secret in Trina&#39;s past is casting the ballot against them. Unless Dwayne can wage a new campaign: to vote her in as his running mate for life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
