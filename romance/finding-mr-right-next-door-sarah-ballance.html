  <title>Finding Mr. Right Next Door - Sarah Ballance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Lexi Dean, burning down her kitchen was disaster enough. Agreeing to move in next door with her totally off-limits best friend, Matt Freeman, until her house is livable again? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utter madness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They&#39;ve always been close, but this is ridiculous. If she&#39;s not bumping into him at the refrigerator, he&#39;s at the front door giving her date the third degree. And slipping between his borrowed sheets? That&#39;s about as distracting as listening to his shower run, because suddenly all she can think about is rivulets of water cascading down is spectacular body--the one he seems to be going out of his way to make sure she notices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that it matters. He can flaunt his firefighter abs around her all he wants. They already share everything--their jobs, their friends, their backyard, even their dog--and that means only one thing: Lexi is not going to risk losing any of it by dipping a single toe in the temptation that is Matt Freeman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lexi may not know how to handle a fire extinguisher, but this is one fire that just might burn them both if they&#39;re not careful...&lt;/p&gt;" />
