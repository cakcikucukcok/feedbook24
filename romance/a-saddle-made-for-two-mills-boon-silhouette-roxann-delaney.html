  <title>A Saddle Made For Two (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Roxann Delaney</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;JUST ONE KISS…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cowboys! Ellie Warren had met enough arrogant men on the rodeo circuit to last her ten lifetimes. She had plans–and they didn&#39;t include a hard-bodied, blue-eyed distraction named Chace Brannigan. But with just one kiss from the bronc-riding champion, Ellie knew her lonely heart threatened her neatly laid plans….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Ellie slipped from his protective embrace, Chace had an overwhelming feeling of needs aching to be fulfilled. But he had promises to keep, and a woman had no place in them. Yet something about Ellie&#39;s solitary goals made him long for things unspoken. Perhaps together they could design a saddle made for two…?&lt;/p&gt;
