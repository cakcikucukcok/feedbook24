  <title>Snowbound with Mr. Wrong - Barbara White Daille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Worst. Day. Ever. After Lyssa Barnett&#39;s sister tricks her into reprising her role at Snowflake Valley&#39;s annual children&#39;s party, she doesn&#39;t think anything can be worse than squeezing into her too-small elf costume. Then tall, dark, and way too handsome Nick Tavlock shows up to play Santa...and an unexpected storm leaves them snowbound in the isolated lodge.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Nick wants is to spend a cozy Christmas Eve with a trio of kids and the woman who dumped him. But as much as Lyssa frustrates him, he can&#39;t stop thinking about her. And soon, he&#39;s fighting very un-Santa-like thoughts of kissing a certain sexy Miss Elf under the mistletoe. As Nick starts to fall for Lyssa all over again, he knows it will take nothing short of a miracle to have Lyssa inhis arms on Christmas Day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Snowflake Valley series is a STANDALONE story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;* Snowbound with Mr. Wrong&lt;br&gt;* One Week to Win Her Boss&lt;/p&gt;" />
