  <title>The Roman Phalera - Robbi Perna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twins Paolo and Carlo Cavaleri are inseparable and share everything as they’ve done for their entire lives. When tragedy strikes, the other must continue alone. Carlo buries himself in his work as a wine broker, his grief submerging the other facets of his life. Then the Fates intervene, setting the stage for the twins to share one last adventure. Carlo wakes up in the middle of a Roman battlefield with Paolo as his comrade in arms. As rational man, Carlo knows it’s only a dream, but it teaches him one of life’s basic truths. As long he keeps Paolo alive in his memories, they will both fulfill their destinies. Not even the antagonism between Carlo and Andiana Allegretti, the daughter of the mysterious owner of an abandoned vineyard near his parent’s winery, can dim the experience. Will Carlo’s destiny include Andiana...or must he find another path? A bronze and silver Roman phalera may hold the answer." />
