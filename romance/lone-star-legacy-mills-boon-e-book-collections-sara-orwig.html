        &lt;p&gt;LONE STAR LEGACY&lt;br /&gt;5 super Mills &amp; Boon Desire novels by bestselling author Sara Orwig. 5 sexy, hot-blooded Texan men for your pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RELENTLESS PURSUIT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A cool million to help a withdrawn child?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Widowed teacher Ava is touched that the girl’s guardian, Texas billionaire Will Delaney, cares so deeply. Now Ava is trying – unsuccessfully – to resist the gorgeous tycoon. Will wants her in his bed. But only for the summer. Unless she can teach him to open his guarded heart to love.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE RELUCTANT HEIRESS&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The illegitimate daughter of a late Texas billionaire, Sophia stands to inherit a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But she doesn’t want a penny! It’s up to Garrett to convince her to accept the inheritance. If she doesn’t, her half-brothers will lose theirs. But in trying to persuade her, he accidentally falls for the proud beauty. Now the truth may cost him his heart…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MIDNIGHT UNDER THE MISTLETOE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She didn’t look like any secretary Zach had ever met.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He needs a live in assistant while he recuperates from an injury. But when Emma Hillman arrives at his Texas ranch with her suitcase, he knows he’ll have to work hard to resist her. She’s sexy and efficient, but way too family oriented for a risktaking globetrotter like him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ONE TEXAS NIGHT…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One night of seduction…and the next morning Jared Weston could never see his best friend’s little sister again. But that didn’t mean he’d stop wanting her… Years later, when the billionaire tycoon hires her, Allison Tyler is all grown up and hotter than ever. But she wants forever; he wants right now. And she’s still off-limits. What’s a hot-blooded Texan to do?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HER TEXAN TO TAME&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hiring a hot blonde to do the cooking? Probably not the smartest decision Texas rancher Ryan Delaney has ever made, especially when the temptation proves irresistible. While Jessica is clear from the start that their affair can’t last, Ryan isn’t about to let his heart’s desire just slip through his fingers…&lt;/p&gt;
