Sue thinks its about time for Ken to pop the question, but her dreams dont seem to make a blip on his radar. Ken is ready to take Sue to a barbershop Christmas concert; shed like a romantic evening alone with her beau. Theyre at the theater when all hell breaks loose &lt;p&gt;
Sue and Ken decide to part ways. Shes given him enough chances, and its time for her to hit the road.
She links up with her friend from Hawaii, Lani. With dreams of spending Christmas in a town like &lt;/i&gt;Its a Wonderful Lifes&lt;/i&gt; fictional Bedford Falls, the two women head to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Sue gets a job as a radio DJ and prepares for a new
life, away from Ken.&lt;p&gt;
Ken thinks Sue and Lani are in southern California, and in an effort to get as far away from his ex as
possible, he plans a road trip of his own. He wants to end up at his Uncle Phil and Aunt Bettys place
in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.&lt;p&gt;
Filled with twists of fate, trips to jail, and bone-chilling weather, &lt;i&gt;Christmas Road Trip&lt;/i&gt; dares to ask  is there such a thing as destiny?" />
