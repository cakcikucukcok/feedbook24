  <title>Just Around The Corner (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Tara Taylor Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Phyllis Langford is everybody&#39;s friend and nobody&#39;s lover. Until she succumbs to the unexpected temptation of Matt Sheffield–and soon after, discovers she&#39;s pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matt&#39;s a loner, a man who hides from the possibility of love and family. Just as well, in Phyllis&#39;s opinion, since she doesn&#39;t want or need anything from him. Not one single thing. But Matt can&#39;t quite leave it at that….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matt and Phyllis arrive at an agreement–he&#39;ll help her out. That&#39;s all. He&#39;ll drive her to the doctor, take care of her household chores. But this agreement gradually leads them to a bigger involvement in each other&#39;s lives, and by New Year&#39;s Eve, they&#39;re ready for the biggest involvement of all: marriage. Which is a good thing, because as it turns out there are &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; babies waiting just around the corner. Happy New Year, Phyllis, Matt and twins-to-be!&lt;/p&gt;
