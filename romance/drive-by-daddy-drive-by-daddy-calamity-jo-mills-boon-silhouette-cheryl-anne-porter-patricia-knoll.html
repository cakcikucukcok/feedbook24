  <title>Drive-By Daddy: Drive-By Daddy / Calamity Jo (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - CHERYL ANNE PORTER, Patricia Knoll</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Drive-By Daddy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;A funny thing happened on the way to the delivery room&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Professor Darcy Alcott prided herself on being able to take care of herself. But that was before she ended up stranded on the side of a desert road–in labor! Just when she really neeeded a hero, a drop-dead gorgeous cowboy wearing a white hat–really–came to her rescue. He delivered her baby…and stole her heart. But could she convince him not to drive off into the sunset–at least not without her?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Calamity Jo&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;There&#39;s a new man in town and she&#39;s hot on the case …&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jo Quillan could smell a story a mile away, and a famous detective in her midst smelled really ripe! Plus, if she could get an exclusive on whatever sexy Case Houston was investigating, it could be her ticket out of Hicksville. But Jo was an accident waiting to happen, so Case knew right away she was on his tail–standing on it, practically. And all he wanted was a vacation! Still, she was maddeningly attractive, and she was right that something&amp;#133&lt;em&gt;unusual&lt;/em&gt;…was up in Calamity Falls.&lt;/p&gt;
