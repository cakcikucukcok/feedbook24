  <title>The Billionaire Bundle - Michele de Winton, Rachel Lyndhurst, Nina Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Boss and her Billionaire - Michele De Winton&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Investment billionaire Dylan Johns always gets what he wants. He is used to giving orders--not taking them--until he&#39;s forced to go on hiatus from his investment company. To bide his time and carry out an old dream, he takes a job on a cruise ship--and ends up taking orders from his gorgeous, but frigid, new boss. He is determined to loosen her up with a fun onboard romance, but their no-strings fling turns serious and Dylan is forced to confess his lies. When the affair threatens to shatter Michaela&#39;s own career dreams, she finds herself caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blackmailed by the Italian Billionaire - Nina Croft &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Olivia Brent is happy with her quiet life in the country, until the loss of her home forces her to search for her estranged father. When she meets the stunningly gorgeous and enigmatic billionaire Luc Severino, her world is turned upside down. Jimmy Brent&#39;s daughter was the last person Luc ever wanted to be with, but she&#39;s the key to finding her father, the man Luc has wanted revenge on for over ten years. He&#39;s willing to use any methods available, including blackmail, to persuade Olivia to help him find Jimmy and put the past behind him. And if blackmail doesn&#39;t gain her total cooperation, then perhaps a little seduction will...&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Spanish Billionaire&#39;s Hired Bride - Rachel Lyndhurst&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blackmailed to marry against his will, Ricardo Almanza needs a wife before he&#39;s thirty, and time is running out. Helen Marshall can&#39;t believe she&#39;s considering Almanza&#39;s outrageous proposal, but she must help clear her parents&#39; debts or they face financial ruin. The small print on the marriage contract changes to read three months as his wife in every way--including in the bedroom. Has she gotten in too deep, or will she need a new contract addendum, extending their marriage forever?&lt;/p&gt;" />
