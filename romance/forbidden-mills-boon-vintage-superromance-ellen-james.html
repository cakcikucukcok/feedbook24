      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana Morgan&lt;/strong&gt; has said to hell with security, her ex-lover and her old life. Now she&#39;s out for adventure, eager for the unpredictable and determined to prove she doesn&#39;t need a man.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just as well, as her instincts warn her that it&#39;s dangerous to need anything at all from the ill-tempered leader of this expedition. &lt;em&gt;Or&lt;/em&gt; his thirteen-year-old sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Petrie&lt;/strong&gt; enjoys his difficult reputation. It keeps people at bay. So why isn&#39;t it working with Dana or even that young kid, Daniel, his faithful, if unwanted, assistant?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While Dana tells Nick to his face that he&#39;s a &quot;royal pain,&quot; privately she has to admit he&#39;s the most exciting man she&#39;s ever met. Unfortunately, Nick swears tehre&#39;s no room in his life for love. And that goes double for Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dana&#39;s taking the chance that they&#39;re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
