  <title>Bar Stories - John R. Hodgson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;James Trip Bonham, Jr. was born rich. He grew up with his family in the swanky Holmby Hills of California. He went to college and had no idea what he wanted to be. After all, he didnt need to work; he was a trust-fund kid. In college, though, Trip found unexpected direction, and his direction was drinking. He found comfort in the stories of fellow bar flies. He felt at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to the dismay of his high-class parents, Trip becomes a bartender. He soon goes a step further and buys a bar of his owna dive in the small town of Sunset Beach. He thrives off the stories of his favorite drunks. He finds purpose as a compassionate, listening ear. As a bar owner, Trip arguably drinks too much, but hes not a drunknot yet, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His life could have gone on like this, late nights and hung-over mornings, but then he meets Holly, and things start to change. Holly is a do-gooder, and shes serious about having a positive effect on the world. Trip isnt sure he deserves her, but as his love grows, he realizes he might have to change. He might have to leave the bar and make some stories of his own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
