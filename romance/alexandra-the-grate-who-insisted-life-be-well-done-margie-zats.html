From students pilfering cutlery to a supervisor whose shriek can only be heard by the neighborhood dogs, it can be said that everything is going relatively well&amp;mdash;although not smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hungry to satisfy the emptiness of her broken marriage and yearning to feel desired, she agrees to be the face of a new cooking show&amp;mdash;and to spend time with the school&amp;rsquo;s handsome CEO, Ted Hudson.
