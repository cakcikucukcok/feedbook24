  <title>The Perfect Wife - Victoria Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perfect wife should be beautiful, trusting, and absolutely agreeable&amp;#8212;or so the Earl of Wyldewood thought. But in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Victoria Alexander&#39;s intriguing tale, he finds that marriage is about more than mere appearances . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Earl of Wyldewood meets Sabrina Winfield, he thinks he&#39;s found the ideal match. Graceful and genteel, the elegant blonde will look simply exquisite displayed on his arm. And a lady like Sabrina will undoubtedly occupy her time with proper matters, leaving him free to pursue his own pleasures . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beneath Sabrina&#39;s delicate beauty lies the most infuriatingly stubborn, wildly  adventurous woman the earl has ever met. She&#39;s nothing like the perfect wife he had imagined. And before long, all he can think of is quieting her biting wit (with his kisses), putting an end to her outlandish schemes (with his own carefully planned seduction), and doing everything in  his power to become the perfect husband.&lt;/p&gt;" />
