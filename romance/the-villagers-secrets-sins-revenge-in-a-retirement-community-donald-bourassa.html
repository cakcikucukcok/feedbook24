  <title>The Villagers: Secrets, Sins &amp; Revenge In A Retirement Community - Donald Bourassa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;People are still talking about the winter of 2015 and the murder of Phil Gagnon. No one remembers that winter more vividly than Assistant Chief Raymond &amp;ldquo;Ray&amp;rdquo; Barrett. The night Phil Gagnon was murdered started out no different than any other Friday night. Ray had stumbled home about eleven o&amp;rsquo;clock after spending the night at &lt;em&gt;Bottoms Up,&lt;/em&gt; a typical small town bar, in the Town of Oxford&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; located on the outskirts of The Villages. Chief Barrett would be the last to admit he&amp;rsquo;s a functioning alcoholic. He spends his off duty hours hanging out at Bottoms Up&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;his home away from home, with drinking his constant companion. But the murder turns Ray&amp;rsquo;s life into more than a blur of working and drinking. He comes face to face with four couples whose lives are turned upside down by the Gagnon murder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each couple&amp;rsquo;s lives are examined, revealing the secrets, sins and desires for revenge seething through these four couples. Will the murder expose deep-rooted pressures each married couple is hiding? Read about who was abused as a child, who hid the real father of her child, how a mother and father deal with a child&amp;rsquo;s suicide, and who finds happiness loving a person of the same sex. Are there such things as happy endings? All this found in the sleepy community called The Villages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book is perfect for book clubs, complete with book topic questions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
