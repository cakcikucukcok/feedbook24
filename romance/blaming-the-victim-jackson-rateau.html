  <title>Blaming the Victim - Jackson Rateau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dorven Marc Forest lived in the United States for 25 years. After being
stunned by a fortuitous coincidence that made him a millionaire, he
was informed that he had the AIDS virus.
Condemned to live with this fate, he became a calm and deliberate madman
and acted accordingly.
Returned to Haiti, his forgotten homeland, he will accomplish his sadistic
mission of infecting a legion of young girls around Port-au-Prince.
Upon his arrival at Toussaint Louverture International Airport, he met the
splendid Adlina who accept his friendship. Will she be a targeted victim
to be sacrifi ced on the altar of horror?
The arrival of Lopold in her life will provide the answer to that, on behalf
of Gods grace in human being; the power of love defying the impossible.
In the melee, the origin of the AIDS, the virus produced at the Fort Detrick
Laboratories, is revealed." />
