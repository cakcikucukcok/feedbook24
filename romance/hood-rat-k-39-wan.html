  <title>Hood Rat - K&#39;wan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;National bestselling author K&#39;wan presents a story of four women fighting to survive in the urban jungle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yoshi&lt;/i&gt; is young, fine, and larcenous. She lives her life playing on men&#39;s hearts as well as their pockets. She learns the hard way that all that glitters isn&#39;t gold.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Billy&lt;/i&gt;, a former high school basketball star, has been looking for love. Then she meets someone new and her whole world is turned upside down and she will never be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reese&lt;/i&gt; is an around-the-way chick, trying to keep up with the Joneses. There&#39;s a revolving door on her bedroom as she tries to find the love she always felt was missing. Her promiscuity leaves her pregnant from a one-night stand and Reese is faced with the task of breaking an age-old cycle, passed down from mother to daughter in her family, and standing on her own.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rhonda&lt;/i&gt; is twenty-something with three kids, by three men, and riding the system all the way to the bank. To her, work is a dirty word; between the multiple checks she gets from the government, and the games she plays with men, she&#39;s living the life of a ghetto superstar. The game soon turns ugly when one of her &quot;sponsors&quot; snaps and decides to get some payback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harlem has never seen four friends as scandalous as these. The neighborhood will never be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
