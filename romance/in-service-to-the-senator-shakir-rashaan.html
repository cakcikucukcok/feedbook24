  <title>In Service to the Senator - Shakir Rashaan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes, politics make the strangest of bedfellows&amp;hellip;and enemies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrell Warren is a rising star within the ranks of the Democratic Party. Buoyed his former heroic exploits in Desert Storm, the two-term senator has ascended quickly, currently being vetted as a part of the party&amp;rsquo;s presidential ticket in the upcoming election cycle, entering rarified air as an African-American politician. He&amp;rsquo;s charismatic, devilishly handsome, and possesses both the pedigree and the type of bipartisan support that could have him sitting in the Oval Office as Commander-in-Chief in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even his unconventional marriage to the stunning Kianna Warren doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to sway the public, as rumors from media circuits continue to swirl around their alternative proclivities. After all, who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to surrender and be in service to the powerful, irresistible statesman? He has managed to claim the American public&amp;rsquo;s imagination, providing the catalyst as the face of the wave of the future of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are forces at work that wish to derail the inevitable, and they will stop at nothing to ensure that Senator Warren is discredited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kianna&amp;rsquo;s unexpected abduction takes him off the campaign trail, as the mysterious organization taking credit for her abduction has made one rather extraordinary demand&amp;mdash;one that threatens to revert American foreign policy back to the previous century&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Cold War&amp;rdquo; history. The ultimatum is clear&amp;mdash;either comply with the demands, or his wife will be killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Service to the Senator&lt;/em&gt; is the latest explosive tale from best-selling author Shakir Rashaan, where a race against the clock might mean the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
