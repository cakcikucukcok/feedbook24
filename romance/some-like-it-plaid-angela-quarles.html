Despite all that, Connall can&#39;t stop wanting to convince his wife to get naked, and he&#39;s starting to wonder if he&#39;s been bewitched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the more he gets to know her, the more he starts to think she&#39;s just what they needed. If only he survives her next demand...&lt;/p&gt;" />
