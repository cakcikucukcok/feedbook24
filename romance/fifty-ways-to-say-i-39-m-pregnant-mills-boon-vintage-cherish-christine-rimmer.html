  <title>Fifty Ways To Say I&#39;m Pregnant (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Christine Rimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;There must be fifty ways to say I&#39;m pregnant!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So why couldn&#39;t Starr Bravo think of at least one? Maybe because though she&#39;d been in love with rancher Beau Tisdale since she was sixteen, they&#39;d agreed that this &quot;summer of love&quot; was just that. That when September rolled around, they&#39;d go their separate ways–she to her glamorous job in New York City, he back to ranch life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now–too late–she knew that the life she wanted was right here, with Beau and their unborn child. And she needed to get the words out–&lt;em&gt;Beau, I&#39;m pregnant&lt;/em&gt;–before their baby did it for her! So why couldn&#39;t she just tell him?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe because there were three words she was longing to hear from him &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
