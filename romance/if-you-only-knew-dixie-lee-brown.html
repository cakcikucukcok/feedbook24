      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The next sexy, suspenseful installment in Dixie Lee Brown&#39;s Trust No One series . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautiful but deadly, Rayna Dugan is a force to be reckoned with&amp;#8212;even in heels.But when her plans for the evening suddenly involve defending her life against a criminal empire, Rayna knows she needs backup. The choice she made to leave Ty and her old mercenary team in Montana starts to seem like a bad call. She&#39;s been running from her feelings for the tough, rugged man, but Rayna needs Ty now more than ever. Yet when &lt;em&gt;Ty&lt;/em&gt; becomes the new target, his help could mean his death . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex-cop Ty Whitlock has spent the last six years waiting for his past to catch up with him. When it finally does, he isn&#39;t expecting the woman he loves&amp;#8212;the one who walked out on him&amp;#8212;to be caught in its web. He knows she&#39;s moved on, but he can&#39;t help wanting another chance with the petite beauty. Ty&#39;s got only one choice: find Rayna and keep her safe. But that&#39;s the easy part. Once he finds her, can he convince her to stay?&lt;/p&gt;" />
