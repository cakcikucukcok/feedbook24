&lt;p&gt;Monty has a goal to travel to the moon. He meets Olivia, a girl, and falls in love with her at first glance, causing him to change all of his plans. Now, Monty&#39;s plan is to marry Olivia, and take her on a &lt;i&gt;Honeymoon on the Moon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Olivias family finds out Monty is a man who drives around a truck and trailer for living, looking for scrap metal to pick up, they are against the marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has to meet and survive her brutal family, make her his bride, and convince her to board the rocket, if he wants to make it to the moon in six days, landing on Saturday, August 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, at 2:00 PM. &lt;/p&gt;" />
