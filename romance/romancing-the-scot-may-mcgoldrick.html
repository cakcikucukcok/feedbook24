  <title>Romancing the Scot - May McGoldrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this stunning series starter by USA Today bestselling author May McGoldrick, meet the new generation of Penningtons...five brothers and sisters of passion and privilege.  Enter their aristocratic world...where each will fight injustice and find love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hugh Pennington--Viscount Greysteil, Lord Justice of the Scottish Courts, hero of the Napoleonic wars--is a grieving widower with a death wish. When he receives an expected crate from the continent, he is shocked to find a nearly dead woman inside. Her identity is unknown, and the handful of American coins and the precious diamond sown into her dress only deepen the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grace Ware is an enemy to the English crown. Her father, an Irish military commander of Napoleon&#39;s defeated army. Her mother, an exiled Scottish Jacobite. When Grace took shelter in a warehouse, running from her father&#39;s murderers through the harbor alleyways of Antwerp, she never anticipated bad luck to deposit her at the home of an aristocrat in the Scottish Borders. Baronsford is the last place she could expect to find safety, and Grace feigns a loss of memory to buy herself time while she recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugh is taken by her beauty, passion, and courage to challenge his beliefs and open his mind. Grace finds in him a wounded man of honor, proud but compassionate. When their duel of wits quickly turns to passion and romance, Grace&#39;s fears begin to dissolve...until danger follows her to the very doors of Baronsford. For, unknown to either of them, Grace has in her possession a secret that will wreak havoc within the British government. Friend and foe are indistinguishable as lethal forces converge to tear the two lovers apart or destroy them both.&lt;/p&gt;" />
