  <title>It Happened In Paradise: Wedded in a Whirlwind / Deserted Island, Dreamy Ex! / His Bride in Paradise (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Liz Fielding, Nicola Marsh, Joanna Neil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wedded in a Whirlwind&lt;/strong&gt; by Liz Fielding&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miranda Grenville is a survivor—a rare beauty who&#39;s fiercely independent. While trekking in a remote island paradise, Manda is caught up in an earthquake. Stuck deep underground in an ancient temple, she finds she&#39;s not alone. Sexy adventurer Nick Jago is trapped with her. Now Manda is forced to depend on someone. She knows she shouldn&#39;t trust him, but something deep inside of her is falling for this rebel….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deserted Island, Dreamy Ex!&lt;/strong&gt; by Nicola Marsh&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being shipwrecked on an idyllic deserted island for reality TV show Stranded sounded blissful. Until I discovered my Man Friday for the week was Jared Malone (aka he-who-broke-my-heart!).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I mean, of course I&#39;ll be fine. I don&#39;t feel anything for him anymore. Female viewers might swoon over Jared&#39;s tanned gorgeousness, but I know he&#39;s just an arrogant, overmuscled heartbreaker!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cameras are rolling, so I&#39;m off to the beach to face Jared. I just hope I look okay in this bikini!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His Bride in Paradise&lt;/strong&gt; by Joanna Neil&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A&amp;E specialist Dr Alyssa Jones breathes a sigh of relief as she looks out over the waving palm trees and white sandy beach – at last, in the Bahamas, she can heal her broken heart. A holiday fling with the deliciously handsome doctor living upstairs could be just the remedy she needs – if only she can keep in mind that it’s temporary…&lt;/p&gt;
