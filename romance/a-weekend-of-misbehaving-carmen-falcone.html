  <title>A Weekend of Misbehaving - Carmen Falcone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When fantasy becomes reality...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing nanny Alice Sommers needs is to be caught skinny-dipping by her sexy, cranky-pants boss--in his pool. Her sister owes a crap-load of money to a slimy loan shark and Alice &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; needs this job if she has any hope of saving her family. Fortunately, her boss is richer than sin and needs &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; just as much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art dealer Lorenzo Baldi will lose his prestigious career if his anarchist father&#39;s paintings are revealed to the art world. He&#39;s determined to persuade the paintings&#39; eccentric owner to sell them to him, even if to pull it off, he&#39;ll have to blackmail his daughter&#39;s nanny--a woman with the sexy curves of a Botticelli masterpiece--into being his fake fiancé. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gorgeous island of Capri inspires some &lt;i&gt;major&lt;/i&gt; misbehaving. But even as the loan shark breathes down Alice&#39;s neck and the paintings move closer to the art scene, Lorenzo drops one more bomb that will change &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
