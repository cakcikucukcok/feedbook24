  <title>The Inheritance (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Janice Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A mystery inheritance–with strings attached!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Roslyn Baines can&#39;t believe what she&#39;s hearing. A great-aunt–someone she&#39;s never even heard of–has left her a large estate in rural Iowa on condition that she give up her career in Chicago for a year and live in the house. Otherwise, the alternate beneficiary–Jack Jensen–will inherit the place.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Well, maybe he should. After all, he helped take care of it for years, while Roslyn didn&#39;t even know this side of her family existed; her grim-faced grandmother never discussed relatives. But Roslyn&#39;s curiosity draws her to Plainsville, Iowa, and once there, Roslyn–with help from Jack–uncovers the painful reasons behind her grandmother&#39;s silence.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, also thanks to Jack, she&#39;s beginning to feel comfortable in the home of her ancestors. Trouble is, if she stays, Jack loses his inheritance. If she leaves, she may never see him again. And that&#39;s a risk she can&#39;t bear to take.&lt;/p&gt;
