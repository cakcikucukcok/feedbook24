  <title>Covering All the Bases - Jody Holford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Talk about a wild day... As if being summoned to the deathbed of a grandfather she didn&#39;t know existed wasn&#39;t enough--Isla Bennett meets the man of her dreams. Spends an amazing day playing tourist around Nashville with him. And then finds out she&#39;s inherited the Nashville Slammers major league baseball team. Oh, and her new dream man? He&#39;s the Slammers&#39; star power hitter. Isla just went from &lt;i&gt;amazing first date to holy heck I&#39;m your boss&lt;/i&gt; in the span of a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liam Cruz can&#39;t believe how refreshing it was to spend a day with someone who &lt;i&gt;didn&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; know his batting average, the size of his last contract, or heck, even that he&#39;s a baseball player. Now Isla&#39;s thrust into the spotlight, and though she&#39;s more than capable of handling herself professionally, he takes it upon himself to teach her everything he can about the game that is his whole life. But they&#39;ll have to keep it on the DL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because doing what&#39;s best for the team means they can never be together--and that might be the toughest play of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the For Love of the Game series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Covering All the Bases&lt;br&gt;* Catching Her Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
