Since she was six years old, she&#39;s seen the world around her unraveling, as if someone is pulling a thread from a sweater and it&#39;s all slowly coming undone. When she ignores it, it goes away, so that&#39;s what she does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter her arrogant-but-hot professor Asher Green. He knows all about her special brand of crazy. In fact, he might be just as nuts as she is. Asher insists that the dead from a parallel dimension are trying to possess the living in this one. And since Addison seems to be the only one who can see these &quot;wraiths,&quot; she just might be the key to saving the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison wants nothing to do with Asher or his secret society, The Mortal Machine. But as their animosity grows, she finds it harder and harder to ignore the chemistry between them. And when she discovers that Machine laws forbid her from touching him, she realizes that&#39;s &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; she wants to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop the wraiths. Break the rules. Save the world. All in a day&#39;s work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Normal was overrated, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;" />
