  <title>Dark Matter - Cameron Cruise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;There are those among us whose mental capacity is so evolved that they are able to tap into abilities that are beyond this world. Often diagnosed as autistic, these medical marvels have led quiet lives, ignored by science.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One by one, these special &quot;Indigo children&quot; are disappearing and turning up dead. Now a boy handcuffed in a basement awaits his turn while two predators fulfill a mission for a madman.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Caring for her own autistic brother, FBI agent Carin Barnes is driven to find the missing boy and hunt down his abductors–psychic twins Adam and Evie. At the command of their father, the pair are collecting children for torturous experiments he believes will lead to the evolution of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But in order to succeed, they need one powerful element…something that Carin and her brother possess…matter that elevates some minds to the highest levels of intelligence–and drags others to the deepest pits of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
