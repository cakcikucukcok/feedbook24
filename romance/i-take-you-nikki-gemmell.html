  <title>I Take You - Nikki Gemmell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From internationally bestselling author Nikki Gemmell comes a tantalizing story of love within marriage&amp;#8212;and alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under her Chanel suit and designer lingerie, Connie Carven is no longer the typical banker&#39;s wife. When Cliff&#39;s horrible skiing accident shifts the balance of their relationship, Connie becomes a willing submissive to her husband&#39;s every desire. Cliff is eager to explore new, and troubling, avenues of passion. Connie, ever the dutiful wife, follows wherever he leads. While at first she enjoys a perverse sense of freedom within the ever-tightening bonds of her marriage, Cliff&#39;s dark desires soon consume her entirely. She finds herself surrendering to an act that will forever remind her that she belongs to her husband alone&amp;#8212;to be unlocked only by him, whenever he pleases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is also this act that awakens Connie from the numbness that has taken over her life. And when she encounters someone new in the communal garden of her Notting Hill home, she discovers the thrill of true intimacy . . . and the price of risking everything for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of the bestselling phenomenon &lt;em&gt;The Bride Stripped Bare&lt;/em&gt; and the exquisite &lt;em&gt;With My Body&lt;/em&gt;, Nikki Gemmell brings erotic writing into the twenty-first century. In &lt;em&gt;I Take You&lt;/em&gt; she looks to the classic &lt;em&gt;Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&lt;/em&gt; for inspiration, reimagining D. H. Lawrence&#39;s celebrated tale as a brutally honest and deeply sensual modern love story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
