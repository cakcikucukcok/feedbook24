  <title>Kristin&#39;s Awakening - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Young and beautiful, Kristin lives with her wealthy dad, and giving in to her secret desires, she seduces him on her twenty second birthday. Neal briefly resists his urges to be with his daughter, but quickly realizes she&amp;#39;s on a mission, and powerless to stop Kristin&amp;rsquo;s advances, they enter into an incestuous affair. Growing even closer, neither wants the affair ever to end, and Kristin begins making plans to spend her life with her dad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A friend of mine fucked you, Kris?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her throat arid as desert sand, Kristin nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Tell me the asshole&amp;rsquo;s name &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll kill the S.O.B.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No. It was my fault &amp;hellip; and I ended it after getting with him a few times.&amp;rdquo; Kristin drained half of her Margarita. &amp;ldquo;But being with him taught me something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that, Kris?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Only older men satisfy me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then why&amp;rsquo;d you end it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have my eye on somebody else, dad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Who?&amp;rdquo; Neal took a sip of scotch. &amp;ldquo;I hope he&amp;rsquo;s not another friend of mine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You know him, but he&amp;rsquo;s not a friend.&amp;rdquo; The alcohol taking effect, her face flush, Kristin placed her hand high on Neal&amp;rsquo;s thigh. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted him for years &amp;hellip; and since his stupid wife left him for a woman, it&amp;rsquo;s only gotten worse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shit. Kris, are you saying &amp;hellip; fuck, I can&amp;rsquo;t even utter the words.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know it&amp;rsquo;s sinful.&amp;rdquo; Kristin&amp;rsquo;s fingers grazed Neal&amp;rsquo;s erection, and tilting her head, she purred, &amp;ldquo;But I want you, daddy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, my God, baby girl. I dream of you every night. Kris, you&amp;rsquo;re the reason I don&amp;rsquo;t date &amp;hellip; no woman measures up. And the escorts just control my urges. But we can&amp;rsquo;t do this&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m your father.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, we can.&amp;rdquo; Kristin wrapped her fingers around Neal&amp;rsquo;s cock, massaging it softly. &amp;ldquo;Daddy, this monster tells me you want to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fuck. You&amp;rsquo;re killing me.&amp;rdquo; Neal placed his hand on Kristin&amp;rsquo;s thigh. &amp;ldquo;God help me. Promise you won&amp;rsquo;t hate me forever, baby girl?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I could never hate you. Finish your drink and pay the bill.&amp;rdquo; Kristin leaned close and nibbled her dad&amp;rsquo;s ear. &amp;ldquo;I love you, daddy. Take me home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Neal placed a wad of cash in the leather folder, and sliding from the booth, tugged Kristin behind him. Standing on trembling legs, Kristin curled her arm through his, leaning into Neal as they walked through the restaurant, both oblivious to the other diners. Outside, Kristin felt wetness seeping onto her inner thighs and stepping into the F150, let her dress slide higher on her legs. His eyes darkening when he hopped in, Neal glanced at Kristin. &amp;ldquo;Are you sure, baby girl? We can&amp;rsquo;t take something this awful back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I want you more than I ever wanted any other man.&amp;rdquo; Kristin reached over the console and grabbing his calloused hand, spread her legs. &amp;ldquo;Feel how wet I am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Neal traced his long fingers over her silky folds and feeling the juices flowing freely, sighed. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a seductress. And I&amp;rsquo;m powerless to break the spell you have over me &amp;hellip; you win.&amp;rdquo;" />
