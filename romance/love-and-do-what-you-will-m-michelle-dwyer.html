But nothing can stop the passion of true love. The two embark on a sixty year affair, but it feels more like a prison of secrecy. The only tie that binds them is Richards gift of a ruby ring. When Kate marries Stephen, she thinks there may be hope for a peacefuleven if not entirely honestfuture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is light on the horizon, as Stephen and Kate settle into married life. Yet, Kates idyllic lifestyle unravels as her carefully hidden secrets are exposed by blackmail that threatens her husbands political future and endangers the lives of her children. Kate must battle her Puritanical upbringing against her vibrant personality to discover how far she will go for love . . . and which of Gods laws she will break in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
