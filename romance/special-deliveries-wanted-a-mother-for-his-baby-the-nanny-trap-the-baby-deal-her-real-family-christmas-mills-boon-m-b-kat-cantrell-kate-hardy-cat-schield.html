          &lt;strong&gt;The Nanny Trap by Cat Schield&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Blake Ford has one summer to get what he wants. He trusted country-bred beauty Bella McAndrews as his surrogate. Now she’s agreed to be his infant son’s temporary nanny. It is only a matter of time before he convinces her to capitulate to his true desire: becoming his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blake believes his son deserves a mother’s love. And Blake is determined to win this woman’s love for himself, too…until a deep secret emerges, turning every truth upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Baby Deal by Kat Cantrell&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When billionaire entrepreneur Michael “Shay” Shaylen becomes guardian to a baby boy, he knows there’s only one woman who can teach him how to be a father—his ex-lover, child psychologist Juliana Cane. So he makes her a deal: if she gives him two months, he’ll give her a boost in her career.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She says yes. Suddenly, Juliana has everything she’s ever wanted: a home, a child—Shay. But she knows this seductive situation is only temporary. Because even as desire burns between them—so do the reasons Juliana has to say good-bye….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Her Real Family Christmas by Kate Hardy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dr Stephanie Scott’s smile can light up a room, and she certainly catches the eye of single dad and obstetric surgeon Daniel Connor! But getting close to him and his little girl isn’t an option for recently divorced and heartbroken Stephanie. She&#39;s long since felt she&#39;ll never fit into a family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But spending time with Daniel and his cute daughter Mia opens Stephanie’s eyes to the possibility that her longed-for wish—a family of her very own—might just come true this Christmas…&lt;/p&gt;
