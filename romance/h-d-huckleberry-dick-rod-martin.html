      <meta name="description" content="This book is a love story, detective mystery, and great American novel. 
Joe Freedom is a private investigator who finds lost things. Sometimes they dont want to be found, which makes it all the more interesting. And for the first time since the last time, hes found love, or thinks he has, shrinks he has, youll see. 
The case: Professor Otis Grilles daughter Alex is missing and family and friends are clueless as to her whereabouts. Joe and his therapist, Vana Fox, team up to profile Alex, search for her, and learn to love each other. They practice often. 
Why is Alexandra Grille hiding out at Valley View Rehab under a cloak of deniability and doctor/patient privilege? She paid cash. She told no one. Is she running away from someone? 
Prose, rap, and other poetic pursuits provide the backdrop for clues and blues and the occasional Red herrings ball bearings Batman, how is a part-time PI supposed to find someone so intent on being lost? Does love get in the way? How can it not? Vanas hot. 
Can Joe find the professors daughter before something awful befalls her? 
Now that hes found Vana, can Joe get anything done? 
Those are the questions.
