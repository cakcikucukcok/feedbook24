  <title>Between Friends - Jenny Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love, secrets and loyalty in contemporary Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta, Carrie and Jane have been friends since they were at school. Now one is bringing up her family, another is desperately trying for children of her own, while the third is focused on her career – and each takes the support of the others as a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when generous Marta bumps into old friend Tom at the height of the Edinburgh festival, she finds he&#39;s an actor out-of-luck. Her kind offer of temporary shelter sets in motion a tsunami of destruction. Marta’s marriage comes under threat. Timid Jane is haunted by the secret she has been hiding since she last saw Tom. And ambitious Carrie finds herself at the mercy of a man who can ruin her career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by pulling together can the friends rid themselves of this menace. But is Tom too clever at sowing mistrust?&lt;/p&gt;" />
