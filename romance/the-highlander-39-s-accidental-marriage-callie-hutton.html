Fate, however, has no such confines. On a journey to the Scottish Highlands, Lady Sarah is set upon by misfortune-leaving her without carriage or chaperone, and left to the mercy of a kind and handsome gentleman. Whom (in order to secure a room at an inn) she announces is her husband. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she proclaims they&#39;re married in public, Professor Braeden McKinnon can&#39;t bring himself to correct the lovely Lady Sarah. After all, her reputation would be ruined. Nor can he tell her that her proclamation is not only legally binding in Scotland, but sharing a room is considered to be an act of consummation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now they are bound together until death do they part-even if Sarah has no intention of becoming &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;man&#39;s wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Marriage Mart Mayhem series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 The Elusive Wife&lt;br&gt;Book #2 The Duke&#39;s Quandary&lt;br&gt;Book #3 The Lady&#39;s Disgrace&lt;br&gt;Book #4 The Baron&#39;s Betrayal&lt;br&gt;Book #5 The Highlander&#39;s Choice&lt;br&gt;Book #6 The Highlander&#39;s Accidental Marriage&lt;br&gt;Book #7 The Earl&#39;s Return&lt;/p&gt;" />
