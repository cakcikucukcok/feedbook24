          &lt;strong&gt;A sparkling trilogy by Patricia Thayer&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;ROCKY MOUNTAIN BRIDES &lt;em&gt;Three sisters coming home to wed!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Raising the Rancher’s Family &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;New York tycoon Holt Rawlins has abandoned his city suits for cowboy boots. He’s gone home to find the truth. That is until Leah Keenan bursts into his life, bringing with her a small boy who needs them both. Holt becomes father and protector, but will the rugged rancher persuade Leah to follow her instincts and stay?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Sheriff’s Pregnant Wife&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sheriff Reed Larkin’s childhood sweetheart has come home and, after all these years, Paige Keenan’s smile still makes his heart ache. But Paige has a secret; there’s a little baby growing inside her and it needs all the love and care she can muster. In Reed’s strong arms she knows that she and her baby will be safe…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; A Mother for the Tycoon’s Child&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No one in town knows the truth of Morgan Keenan’s past. It takes tycoon and single dad Justin Hilliard to slowly show the willowy redhead that she can love and be loved. With the help of his cute little daughter, he shows Morgan that she belongs with them – as an adored wife and mother.&lt;/p&gt;
