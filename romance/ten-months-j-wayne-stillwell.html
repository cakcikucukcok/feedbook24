  <title>Ten Months - J. Wayne Stillwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Very few things affect us more than rejection by someone we want to love us but they dont, or they do but cant say it. This is especially true when two people are inhibited by conservative beliefs, religious fervor and the inability to follow their heart. A hard and distant father can be one of those people but so can your first encounter with romantic love when she or he passes through your life and then goes away. Our personal convictions can become a source of conflict and pain, but thats the back story to so many one sided relationships. It can be exhilarating and agonizing leaving you euphoric one moment and in despair the next. Sean Rochester leaves the safety of a small town in 1964 at the age of seventeen to earn a chance at an education. He was not prepared for the real world and the harsh lessons it would teach him. From the under belly of a large city and the insincerity of so called friends, to dealing with street smart men and affairs of the heart, his education began immediately. The ebb and flow of life produces more successes than failures and ends with a mysterious visit. Ten Months is a fast paced fiction romance story about the experiences, passion, ambitions and hopes of two young people. Everyone has a lost love; maybe you will remember yours as you read this story." />
