  <title>Not My First Rodeo 2 Boxed Set - Donna Alward, Jenna Bayley-Burke, Sarah M. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Donna Alward&#39;s Seducing the Sheriff, Cassidy&#39;s first foray into online dating is an unqualified disaster. Witness to a bank robbery, she&#39;s now in danger. Sexy sheriff Joe Lawson is willing do whatever it takes to protect her, even if that means hiding her away in his secluded mountain cabin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Roping the Rancher by Sarah M. Anderson, all Tommy knows is girls his own age don&#39;t do it for him. Carly has no interest in being anyone&#39;s cougar, but when Tommy says he&#39;ll do whatever she tells him to, she can&#39;t resist the chance to take what she wants from a man with no strings attached. But no one said anything about scarves...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jenna Bayley-Burke&#39;s Captivating the Cowboy, aspiring designer Jules is about to head to New York. Before she leaves, she&#39;s going to help widower Slade Weston find the perfect ranch wife, but finding his forever turns into schmexytimes. Jules doesn&#39;t want to be a wife and mom, and Slade isn&#39;t moving across the country. It&#39;s just a fling, until she&#39;s not sure where she truly belongs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
