But even with proof that he lied to her about his relationship with Ileana, she can&#39;t help but submit to his seductive touch. Deciding to fight for their relationship, Kate falls deeper in love with the man who once held her heart.  But Matt&#39;s past with Ileana is just the tip of the iceberg...there&#39;s more to his history than he&#39;s been telling her, and this time, it may finally be enough to tear them apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other scintillating installments of the erotic serial novel His to Command: The Chase (Part 1), The Capture (Part 2), The Revelation (Part 3), The Arrangement (Part 4), and The Surrender (Part 6) available January 2013!&lt;/p&gt;" />
