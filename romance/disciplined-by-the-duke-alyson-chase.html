Willing to do anything to save her sister from the hangman&#39;s noose, now she is a spy... A servant. A liar. A thief. A submissive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masquerading as a parlor maid and entrenched in the Duke of Montague&#39;s estate, Liz is willing to risk all to uncover the secrets that would save her sister.

Eager to relinquish control of her messy life, Liz soon craves the rough hands of Montague and his powerful, passionate attentions.  Can she succumb to the hot sting of his hand and the gentleness of his kisses without revealing her true identity and darkest secrets?  And what punishment will she face when he realizes her betrayal?&lt;/p&gt;" />
