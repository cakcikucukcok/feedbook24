  <title>Vamp - Maggie Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MIRROR IMAGE PROVIDES POOR REFLECTION&lt;p&gt;
Two sisters bearing a striking resemblance to one and other could easily trade places, at least momentarily---- a glance past their ebony hair and eyes of stormy sea green exposes their true identity. For although they mirror one and other in form, Molly and Merry posses opposing personalities:one is a temptress motivated by vanity and opportunism, while the other is easily intimidated and a vulnerable outcast. Their association seems completely unfathomable.&lt;p&gt;
Molly and Merry are parted during childhood as a result of the pyschological distance between them. Molly&#39;s extroversion allows her to attend the prestegious Primrose School for Young Ladies, where her popularity soars: Merry is relegated to Fotheringale, a school for &quot;backward&quot; children. Their separation continues for a lifetime, but tragedy strikes, they are briefly reunited. Unless they use this opportunity to reconcile their differences, their fate will rest in the clutches of despair." />
