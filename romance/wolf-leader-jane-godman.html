  <title>Wolf Leader - Jane Godman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The final book in the new Arctic Brotherhood series--heart-pounding werewolf romances by Jane Godman that will keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are the Arctic Brotherhood. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;They are deadly fighters, fierce protectors and loyal mates. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their sworn enemy is dead, but the Arctic Brotherhood can&#39;t relax. Fenrir, the Norse god of destruction is still determined to destroy the world. Vigo Durand agrees to lead the team against the most feared werewolf the world has ever known, but dark secrets from his past are threatening to catch up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amber Merova has been on the run for the last five years ago. When she meets Vigo, her werewolf mating impulse almost overwhelms her human instinct for survival. Almost. Feisty, determined, and hostile, Amber initially turns down Vigo&#39;s offer to stay with the Brotherhood. When it looks like the men who murdered her pack have caught up with her, she has no choice but to take his offer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both seem damaged beyond repair, but, as they work together to bring down Fenrir, they discover hidden ties that bind them together. Before they can look to the future, they must unravel the mysteries of the past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
