  <title>Alphabet for H Street - Barbara O’Donnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is love? What do men really want? Why do so many of them seem afraid of smart, educated women? What boundaries should you set? How do you soldier on when jilted by boyfriends and jobs are hard to come by? The early 1970&#39;s is the setting for this Sacramento novel describing the whirlwind adventures shared by Cat and Dorie as they try to make sense of their world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are divorced, just graduated from Sacramento State&#39;s master&#39;s program in English Literature, ad just home from a very dazzling trip to Ireland. They share a battered duplex on H Street as they get on with their lives and try to figure things out. This is a journey that most women will recognize, will laugh out loud, and cry &quot;remembrance&quot; tears. &quot;We&#39;ve been there, done that,&quot; they&#39;ll say. Hopefully, we have come out on the other side, sane and satisfied!&lt;/p&gt;" />
