~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From &amp;quot;Aphrodite&amp;#39;s Lover&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phaedra barely remembered the drive home. By the time she arrived back at her apartment complex, with the too-rapid fall of the dank winter night closing in about her, her slacks were unzipped and gaping wide. At every stoplight her hands had dipped helplessly below the waistband, frantically fingering the hungry lips of her sex. Three times she had fallen into an ecstatic haze, only to be interrupted by the annoyed horns of cars who were stuck waiting behind her when the light turned green.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stumbled up the stairs to the apartment she shared with her son, empty to everything but the insatiable need inside her. Her fingers fumbled as she tried to slot the key into the lock, and once inside, she scattered her clothes behind her as she made a beeline for the bedroom. The first to go was the heavy jacket, dropped as soon as the door closed behind her. Then the shoes, the comfortable, sensible flats kicked off in a haze of irritation. Then the blouse, unbuttoned and flung aside, falling who-cares-where. By the time she pushed open the door to her bedroom, her slacks were down to her knees, and she half-hopped, half-hobbled to the bed, where the shoved them down and off her legs with quick jerks of her arms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She rolled over and onto her back, not even bothering to turn on the bedside lamp. Raising her hips in the air, she peeled her panties off. The fabric was damp around her groin, almost seeming to stick to her throbbing nether-lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She laid back with a groan, her eyes closed. Unbidden, her right hand plunged into her cleft, two fingers rigid and slightly curled. She had never masturbated often. Certainly not like Nikki when he first discovered the joys of self-pleasure, staying in his room with the door locked. But this was less a desire than a need, a panting need to climax. Her free hand squeezed her paltry breasts, fingers clenching, as her hips rose up to meet her thrusting fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her blood seemed to thunder in her ears, and she realized she was whimpering, the empty urgent ache inside her only growing more insistent with every breath she took.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Goddess...Goddess, please. I need...I need...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~I can grant you what you wish,~ a voice seemed to murmur in her ears. ~But there will be a price. There always is. Great gifts demand great sacrifices.~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Anything,&amp;quot; she panted. She was almost weeping with frustration. &amp;quot;Please!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~So be it.~" />
