  <title>Kissing Her Crazy - Kira Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An island vacation at a 5-star resort for her brother&#39;s wedding should have been relaxing. But for single mom Lena Oserkowski, it&#39;s stress-inducing. As long as she stays away from the water, her biggest fear, it&#39;ll be okay, right? Except when her son gets into trouble at the pool, Lena ends up needing her own rescue. To her surprise--and mortification--a gorgeous stranger comes to her aid. Suddenly her trip just got a whole lot more interesting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elliot Debusshere is disillusioned with his wealthy playboy lifestyle and wants nothing more than to bring some meaning and purpose to the charity he runs. When he saves a quirky, beautiful woman from a case of heat exhaustion and meets her son, Tyler, he has no idea the answer to his problems might have just fallen in his lap. Literally. But pleasure has a sneaky way of mixing with their business, leaving both dazed and confused. Elliot isn&#39;t father material--except the longer he spends with Lena and Tyler, the more he wants to be. Now he just needs to prove it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Crazy Love series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Driving Her Crazy&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Kissing Her Crazy&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Loving Her Crazy&lt;/p&gt;" />
