  <title>Deck the Halls - Donna Alward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With shades of &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life&lt;/i&gt;, one man must face his past to find his future this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year, George&#39;s life has drastically changed. The formerly homeless veteran now has a job he likes, a family in the residents of Darling, VT, and for the first time in years, a home. But while his present is good, he&#39;s still haunted by the past, a past that appears shortly before Christmas when the older sister of his brother-in-arms hunts him down and finds him in Darling, working at the Ladybug Garden Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy&#39;s looking for closure for her family after her brother&#39;s death in the Middle East, but the serious man she finds working in Vermont doesn&#39;t resemble the soldier she remembers from years before. This man is hardened and yet somehow fragile, too, and in her desire to find out what really happened to her brother, she learns more about George than she ever expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a little Christmas magic and the whole town supporting them, can these two bruised hearts make a future together?&lt;/p&gt;" />
