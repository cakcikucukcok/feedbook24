  <title>Catching the Player - Diane Alberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Kassidy Thomas decided to stop hiding behind her past, and start living, she didn&#39;t quite bet on that start including her singing a horrible song in front of the handsomest bachelor in the NFL, Wyatt Hamilton. She also didn&#39;t think he&#39;d then ask her out on a date, but turns out when you&#39;re actually living life...crazy things happen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wyatt is a player in every sense of the word. Married to the game, he has no interest in relationships, love, or even second nights with the same woman. But from the moment the girl-next-door beauty Kassidy knocks on his door to deliver a singing telegram, nothing goes as planned. He can&#39;t stop thinking about her, and he keeps showing up on her doorstep for more, even though he knows he shouldn&#39;t. Because as hard as she is to resist, falling for her could cost him everything.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Hamilton Family series is STANDALONE.&lt;br&gt;* The CEO&#39;s Seduction&lt;br&gt;* Romancing the Bachelor&lt;br&gt;* Catching the Player&lt;/p&gt;" />
