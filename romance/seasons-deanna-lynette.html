  <title>Seasons - Deanna Lynette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who said growing up in a Christian family would be drama free? Apparently youve never met the Spencer family. Kennede, Summer, Brandi and Brianna are close cousins dealing with numerous issues from rape to infidelity to abuse; and thats just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kennede Johnson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: the oldest and the first of the foursome to get married at the age of eighteen, along with having her first child a year later. But soon after Kennede turned 22 her seemingly perfect life was destroyed and she was newly divorced. Although her ex has moved on, she cant deny her feelings for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Summer Parker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: the naive one that also has very low self-esteem. Because of her poor self-image, Summer has been in an abusive relationship for six years; while everyone including her childhood friend tries to help her escape the dangerous hands of her violent boyfriend. Brandi and Brianna Wright are twin sisters that come from a broken dysfunctional home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brandi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the outgoing and more open twin who was once a stripper that now helps her longtime drug dealing boyfriend raise his 4 year old son. But the pain from her days of stripping has now come back to haunt her as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally theres &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brianna&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; who is the quiet and creative twin that keeps dating all the wrong men, thats until she meets Dr. Hamilton. Shortly after their first meeting, she falls deep in love with the good doctor despite the fact that hes almost 20 years her senior and married. When Brianna decides to break things off, she soon discovers she is pregnant and is now forced to make a critical decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will this group of young women deal with the changes that come along with each passing Season?&lt;/p&gt;" />
