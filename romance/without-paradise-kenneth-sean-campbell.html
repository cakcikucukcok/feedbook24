  <title>Without Paradise - Kenneth Sean Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a gay twist on Brief Encounter, Charlie Morgan and Ben McSwain meet on a train and are instantly drawn to each other.  Charlie is a gay writer and atheist.  Ben is an evangelical Christian, widowed with two children, who has never even thought about a relationship with another man.  While it appears that these two have nothing in common, they find that they are &quot;soulmates.&quot;  It&#39;s a surprising and joyous discovery for Charlie and a confusing one for Ben as they try to bridge their vastly different lives&lt;p&gt;
Ben has a full life with his work as a nurse, his family and his devotion to his church.  His love for Charlie and a personal tragedy will test all of those commitments and make him question everything in his life.  Charlie&#39;s work takes him to Texas to write a Broadway-bound show in collaboration with his old college roommate, Lee, and sexy, young country and western star, Luke Beecham.  It looks like a smash hit until a secret from Lee&#39;s past shatters everyone&#39;s chances for happiness and brings Charlie to the loneliest place in his life." />
