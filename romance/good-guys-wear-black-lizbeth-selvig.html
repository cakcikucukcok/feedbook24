  <title>Good Guys Wear Black - Lizbeth Selvig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dewey Mitchell loves three things: fixing old cars, football, and family. Although an illness robbed him of his NFL dreams and his hopes for a big family of his own, he&amp;#39;s made himself content working the family business and coaching middle school football. But when his town&amp;#39;s vibrant new librarian and her young, emotionally challenged son burst into his ordered life, Dewey finds himself inexplicably drawn to the fascinating woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston-born Rose Hanrehan had no idea how different living in a small town would be. But she&amp;#39;s determined to start fresh for her son, who deals with Asperger&amp;#39;s syndrome, without her overbearing parents judging her every move. Of course, sometimes her new neighbors seem to be equally closed-minded. And there&amp;#39;s one new neighbor she can&amp;#39;t seem to avoid &amp;#8230; in fact, the handsome Dewey, despite his black hat and buried emotions, might end up being the only reason to stay in Kennison Falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither one is looking for love, but what they&amp;#39;re starting to feel can&amp;#39;t be anything else. Will the longtime bachelor and the free-spirited librarian let themselves fall? Or will their differences get in the way of their happy ending?&lt;/p&gt;" />
