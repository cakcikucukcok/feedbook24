          &lt;strong&gt;Gwynn Macka hasn&#39;t seen Brett Sorrellson in over a year, not since their relationship had ended so abruptly.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not since the brilliant, sexy man she fell for learned her secret and she&#39;d been forced to flee. Now Brett is back with an offer to join a covert military unit of shapeshifters, and the spark of their attraction is instantly reignited.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Neither can resist sharing one last night of passion, but as a cougar shifter, Gwynn had been taught only to trust her own kind. Can she truly trust Brett with her secret…and with her heart?&lt;/p&gt;
