  <title>Almost Even - Ayo Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jennifer Cole was born to a single mother who was deserted during her conception by her uncommitted lover. She grew up to learn the fact of her fatherless life and the pains and sorrow her mother had passed through.
She became resolved to take it out on every man that crossed her path. Even her career success and her beauty could not hinder her calm resolution. Every man that encountered her never had a good story to tell. Then she met her equal in Ian McHughes, the only man she ever loved and ever wanted but never would have because he fell in love with her best friend and flatmate while she was playing hard to get. She would either have him, or no one would. But how would she cope with this strange feeling of love? How would she manage the love she has never known? Would she accept the fair retribution of fate? Or would she attempt to play out her desire for vengeance on her unknown half-brother?" />
