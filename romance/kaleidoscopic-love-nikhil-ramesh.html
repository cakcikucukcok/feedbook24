  <title>Kaleidoscopic Love - Nikhil Ramesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first time he saw her, he was nothing short of spellbound by her beauty. 
For two years, Aakash and Aasma have communicated only through social media and the occasional phone call. For both, the attraction is undeniableand instant. Breathless with excitement, the young lovers explore their new emotions. 
As their few precious days together come to an end, they part. Aakashconvinced that this will be the last time he will ever see heris devastated. Alone and filled with sorrow, he risks everything to share his true feelings with her in a simple text:
I love you, Aasma. 
Aggravated by the physical distance that separates them, their passions cool as the months roll by; both fear their love story may be coming to an end. But fate had other plans for them. An unexpected event rekindles the flames between them and both are filled with hope for a new beginning and their love is reborn in that moment. 
Encouraged and inspired by his kindness and devotion, she assures him that she loves him as wellso much so that she decides to pursue her heart and move to be near him. She begins life at his side, and both are filled with hope for a new beginning. 
To Aasmas surprise, her childhood friend, Rishab, is her classmate. This new interest complicates the couples love story. Aakash struggles to trust in her devotion, despite Aasmas assurances. When Aakashs worst fears are seemingly confirmed, he has a choice to make." />
