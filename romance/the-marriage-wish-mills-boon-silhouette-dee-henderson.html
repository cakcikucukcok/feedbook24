      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Successful, blessed with friends and a rich faith–as Scott Williams&#39;s thirty-eighth birthday dawned, he was at the top of his game. Or was he? Although his life seemed perfect to others, Scott felt that something was missing. But how could a rugged executive admit he yearned for a family of his own to love?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After making a birthday wish to meet the woman of his dreams, Scott encountered enchanting author Jennifer St. James strolling along the beach. Her beautiful looks hid a heart mourning her late husband and a faith once deep, now fragile. Would Scott&#39;s hopes and prayers bring fulfillment for both of their dreams?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Bestselling author Dee Henderson&#39;s classic first romance!&lt;/em&gt;
