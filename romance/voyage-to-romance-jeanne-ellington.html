  <title>Voyage to Romance - Jeanne Ellington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Voyage to Romance tells a story about a young French girl working in a caf, catering to American GIs. Renee had dreamed of college and a career, but that was financially impossible for her. She decided that marriage was her next-best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After knowing Rob for several months, she felt that she had met her own true love. A golden opportunity to know him better came when he said how much he missed home and family, so she invited him to her home for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she hadnt considered a potential problem by doing so. Ria., her pretty older sister, nearer Robs age, was down over a recent breakup with her long-time boyfriend and ready to play the field. And Rob was there to play with her. Renee was heartbroken. Would she ever find anyone like Rob? Would her wish come true that he would fall in love with her, after all? Or, was she to lose the man she loved and, perhaps, her sister too?&lt;/p&gt;" />
