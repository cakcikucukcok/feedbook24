  <title>Practice Makes Pregnant (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Lois Faye Dyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;For the first time in her life, shy secretary Allison Baker threw caution to the wind. No sooner did she enter the party than suave attorney Jorge Perez whispered sweet compliments in her ear. Breathless, Allison was captivated by her handsome admirer but anxious about the aftermath of their fireworks. Weeks later, she made a stunning discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though stubborn and proud, Jorge moved mountains to find his disappearing damsel after their special night. And then he was humbled by Allison&#39;s two-word declaration–&quot;I&#39;m pregnant.&quot; Of course, Jorge had to marry her for their baby&#39;s sake. As for love, could he admit to his new wife the tender feelings brewing in his soul?&lt;/p&gt;
