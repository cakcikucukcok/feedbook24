  <title>The White Climb - Brian D. Kharpran Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Raymond Sunn was elated when he was invited to join a mountaineering expedition to the far reaches of Leh, Ladakh. After summitting the snow-bound peak, he with a few of his climbing comrades, investigated a cave he had noticed on his ascent of the mountain. Little did he know that his inquisitiveness would get him and the expedition team members into serious trouble when the cave, halfway up the mountain, proved to be a cache of a huge amount of explosives and other armaments of Pakistani terrorists who had sneaked into India on a mission to create chaos in New Delhi and to assassinate the Prime Minister of India on the countrys celebration of its 65th anniversary of independence. His tenacious and dogged attempt in destroying the stockpile of highly sophisticated weaponry thwarted the hideous designs of Amir Abdullah, a merciless and ruthless leader of the Laskhar group of terrorists, known throughout the world as The Ruthless Maniac. The plot moves from the far reaches of Leh, to Rawalpindi, New Delhi, Mumbai, the United States of America and culminated dramatically in Srinagar." />
