  <title>Love Never Fails - Samantha Arran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="London Metropolitan Commander Amanda Dansie, SAS trained, is badly wounded during an engagement in which four of her team are killed. Suddenly she is transformed from an incredibly fit, active young woman into a semi-invalid with a shattered kneecap.
4 years previously she had accused Colonel Mark Young of neglect when her fianc whom she had known since she was three years old, was killed in Afghanistan. 
Mark had been exonerated. There was no way he could have prevented Andrew with two soldiers being killed as other soldiers before and since. In hospital with the same tragedy happening to her team, she realized how unfair she had been to this man.
She came to Derbyshire to recuperate for a month whilst specialists world wide tried to think of technology to repair her knee, to find Mark.
Unknown to her when his time was up in Afghanistan, he joined the Derbyshire police force as a senior Inspector. He was contacted that Amanda needed to meet with him, and he agreed to be her swimming therapist, companion and bodyguard.
They became deeply in love with each other--------" />
