      <meta name="description" content="&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;i&gt;She wants him to what?&lt;/i&gt; That&#39;s Marine Corps captain Travis McCormick&#39;s reaction when his old friend Tess Bartlett asks for basic training in sex. He&#39;s back in his hometown to recover from injuries and is glad that sweet, easy-to-talk-to Tess will be his physiotherapist. But the last thing he expects is that she&#39;ll ask for a trade: she&#39;ll heal him if he&#39;ll bed her!&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Turns out inexperienced Tess wants to explore her sexual side. Travis is happy to comply--she&#39;s incredibly desirable and doesn&#39;t even know it. But when a fellow marine sets his sights on Travis&#39;s new recruit, he realizes that sexually liberating Tess may have been a tactical error. And he&#39;ll need all his seductive skills to make sure she&#39;s signing up for a permanent post in &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; bed--and no one else&#39;s!" />
