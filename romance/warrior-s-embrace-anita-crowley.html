      <meta name="description" content="Just a few days ago, the only stress Leta has had in her life is her stupid ex-boyfriend. Now her stresses include goddesses, demons, and vampires! Who would have thought?
Down-to-earth Leta Ryan has never believed in the supernatural. Her life has been boring and normal, and thats how she likes itthat is, until she awakes on her birthday with a crescent moon tattooed on her body. Giving in to her best friend, Kate Johnson, she reluctantly pays a visit to a psychic who informs Leta she is the Greek goddess Nyx in human form.
Kantos Argyrostall, dark, and dangerousis a 3,500-year-old vampire whose sworn duty is to protect humans from the evils of the world. A true loner, Kantos has sworn off women almost two thousand years agothat is, until he starts to dream of a woman who bears the mark of Nyx.
Their worlds collide when Kantos is charged to protect her from his nemesis, Athos, a demon king on the hunt for vengeance and power. Can these two opposites come together and set aside their differences to realize their potential? Or will history repeat itself?" />
