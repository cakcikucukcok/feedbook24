  <title>Mothers In Love: TruLOVE Collection - Anonymous-BroadLit, Ron Hogan, BroadLit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;MOTHERS IN LOVE: The Good, the Bad and the Unbelievable&lt;BR&gt;*By Anonymous&lt;BR&gt;Edited by Ron Hogan&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There&amp;#8217;s love, and then there&amp;#8217;s mother love -- maybe the most powerful love of all. Meet the mothers at the center of each of the 14 love stories included in this TruLOVE Collection. Whether their stories were written in 1938 or within the last few years, and whether they&amp;#8217;re about a single mom, a stepmother, or an overbearing mom who can&amp;#8217;t let go, each one explores the struggle and challenge of love and motherhood. Several stories focus on women who became single mothers unexpectedly, either through abandonment or widowhood. Another story finds a stepmother trying to deal with her husband&#39;s very unhappy child from a previous marriage. In most of these stories, our inspiring moms overcome their unhappy circumstances to find a sense of great self-respect. They also find new loves with good men who can be good fathers to their children. Even those mothers who try to keep a stranglehold on their children out of fear of eventually being left utterly alone, have their own journey to romance, and it is not an easy one. All of the heroines in these stories learn valuable lessons about coping with adversity and are rewarded by finding true love. We hope you find these stories exciting, heartwarming and, most of all, romantic!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
