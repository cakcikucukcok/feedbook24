  <title>How to Tame a Wild Fireman - Jennifer Bernard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bachelor Firemen of San Gabriel have a rebel among them, and there&amp;#39;s only one woman who can put his flames out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefighter Patrick &amp;#34;Psycho&amp;#34; Callahan earns his nickname every day. Fast, fit, and a furious worker, he thrives on the danger which helps him forget a near-tragedy that changed his life forever. But when his off-duty carousing gets out of hand, Patrick is sent back to Loveless, Nevada, where the wildfire threatening his hometown has nothing on sizzling Dr. Lara Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara would rather be thought of as the physician who returned to Loveless than as the misfit brought up at a hippie New Age commune. But right now she&amp;#39;s focused on the job at hand, patching up injured firemen . . . until the past hits her in the hard-muscled, blue-eyed form of Patrick Callahan. Now, the embers of their decade-old attraction have ignited into a full-on inferno, as the bad-boy firefighter and the good doctor take a walk on the wild side they&amp;#39;ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
