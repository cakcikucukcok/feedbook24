  <title>Trick Me Once - Sharon Clare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Magic pushes them together. Reality pulls them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Humiliated radio show host Jessica Stirling is a survivor, yet nothing prepares her for the stage trick that delivers her across the country to a man suspiciously like the nineteenth-century folk hero idolized by Hollywood. About to lose her job, her life savings, and the home that matters to her more than love, she can&amp;rsquo;t stay stranded in the mountains with a dangerously appealing man who believes in elves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Trapped in an Elvin world for a century, Scottish artist Aiden MacAuley is finally free and back on Earth. But he&amp;rsquo;s not home. He&amp;rsquo;s not safe. And he&amp;rsquo;s not alone. To prevent the destruction of his bloodline, he must get back to Scotland immediately. He can&amp;rsquo;t be distracted by the exasperating woman sent to him by a match-making elf, even if she does stir his lust like no woman has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;When she tries to heal the sins of his past, he can&amp;rsquo;t open his heart. There&amp;rsquo;s too much to lose and as the new guardian of the gate between the human and Elvin worlds, he isn&amp;rsquo;t free to fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
