          &lt;strong&gt;Modern Romance July 2015 Books 1-4&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE RUTHLESS GREEK’S RETURN by Sharon Kendrick&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once Loukas Sarantos was bodyguard to the world’s richest men. Now the ruthless Greek is a CEO with bodyguards of his own. And his most recent procurement means he can finally take revenge on Jessica Cartwright – the only woman to ever walk away from him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the face of Loukas’s new, luxury jewellery company, formerly out-of-his-league Jessica now has to answer to him – and he will relish every second of having her under his control! But as the embers of their former fire reignite, Loukas begins to realise Jessica may be the most precious jewel in his possession…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;BOUND BY THE BILLIONAIRE’S BABY by Cathy Williams&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Sergio Burzi’s table at an exclusive London restaurant is invaded by a stunning woman fleeing a blind date, he’s intrigued. Candid, innocent artist Susie Sadler is nothing like the women he normally dates. The urge to sweep her into his gilded realm—if only for the night—is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But there are repercussions to taking what you want and Sergio’s rigidly controlled world is soon shattered—Susie’s pregnant! Now they’ll have to find a way to face their uncertain future together and resist the craving for each other that impulsive night ignited…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;MARRIED FOR AMARI’S HEIR by Maisey Yates&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It may have been Charity Wyatt’s father who stole from mogul Rocco Amari, but it’s Charity who will pay the price of Rocco’s vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Relinquishing her virginity should have covered Charity’s debt, but her one white-hot night with the enigmatic Italian has unexpected consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Determined her baby will have a better childhood than she did, Charity asks Rocco for financial help. But Rocco has bigger plans in mind: to legitimise his heir by making Charity his wife!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A TASTE OF SIN by Maggie Cox&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even before he strides into her London shop, billionaire restaurateur Gene Bonnaire’s merciless and seductive reputation precedes him. Antiques dealer Rose Heathcote has encountered men like him before and is determined never to give in to one again!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Charismatic Gene always gets what he wants and what he wants now is Rose’s shop for his new restaurant – and its current alluring owner in his bed! Securing the shop will be easy; Rose can’t deny the benefits of his business offer. But seducing this defiant beauty will be more of a challenge…and Rose stands to be his greatest acquisition yet!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are eight fantastic NEW Modern novels every month&lt;/p&gt;
