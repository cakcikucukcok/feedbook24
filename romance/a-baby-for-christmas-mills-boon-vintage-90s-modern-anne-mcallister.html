  <title>A Baby For Christmas (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Anne McAllister</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;THIS TIME, FOREVER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once, he accused her of trading sex for a wedding ring… . Carly knew Piran wasn&#39;t her Mr. Right. He&#39;d rejected her innocent infatuation years ago, and he certainly didn&#39;t see himself as a doting husband and father! Now they had joint custody of a baby!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now Piran needed Carly&#39;s help: a baby had been abandoned on his doorstep. He fiercely denied he was a father… . So whose child was it? Piran was determined to find out but, meanwhile, he was left holding the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And his paternal instincts were a little rusty! Forced into being a surrogate family with Piran, Carly began to wonder if Christmas had not only turned him into perfect father material - but an ideal husband, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
