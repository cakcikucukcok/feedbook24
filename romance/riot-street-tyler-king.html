      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I&#39;ve fallen in love with Tyler King&#39;s writing style and absolutely can&#39;t wait for her next book. Whatever it is, I&#39;ll be buying it! If you&#39;re looking for a swoony, addictive romance with just the right balance between angst, heartbreak, and hilarity, with light-hearted banter, a sexy love story, but also some serious and darker themes, then you have to try this book!&quot; -- Aestas Book Blog&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;The Debt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Avery Avalon is starting over for a second time. After a unique upbringing and painful past, she&#39;s determined to reinvent herself as she enters adulthood. In her path to become a journalist, she is disheartened that the only thing people want from her is to hear about her infamous father - the one who is in prison. It doesn&#39;t help that the only job offer she receives comes from the one man she&#39;d rather not owe a favor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Without a better offer, Avery reluctantly takes the job at &lt;i&gt;Riot Street&lt;/i&gt; magazine, working side by side with Ethan Ash. The man who launched his career as the first journalist to get Avery&#39;s father to talk after he was sentenced to prison. The man who she wants nothing to do with. The man who seems to understand her more than anyone else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As Avery begins to let Ethan in, what she hopes will be a new beginning, a release from her past life, proves too good to be true. She can&#39;t keep the past hidden forever and as the fate of her father and his crimes force her to confront her own issues, she realizes that Ethan may have darker demons than her." />

No doubt. I've read both of her published books (and The Debt as fan fiction, which was so much better than the published version). But I think she struggles a little with crafting her stories.
