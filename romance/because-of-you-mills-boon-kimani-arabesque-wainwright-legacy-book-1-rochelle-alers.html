  <title>Because of You (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) (Wainwright Legacy, Book 1) - Rochelle Alers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From the author of the bestselling Hideaway novels comes the first in a sexy new series, The Wainwright Legacy, chronicling the lives and loves of two prestigious New York families.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;High-profile lawyer Jordan Wainwright is an expert at uncovering the truth for his clients. But he guards his own secrets closely, especially those surrounding his adoption by the powerful Wainwright family. Meeting attorney Aziza Fleming at a party, he&#39;s captivated by her ambition and sensual warmth. Although Aziza insists she&#39;s not looking for anything serious, their casual dates spill over into sultry, pleasure-filled nights.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aziza has been burned twice before–first by a bad marriage, then by a harassment case that nearly destroyed her career. Sophisticated and irresistibly sexy, Jordan could be everything she wants, if he proves to be the trustworthy man she needs. However, he&#39;ll have to choose–between keeping a decades-old secret, or embracing their newfound passion.&lt;/p&gt;
