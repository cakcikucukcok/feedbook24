      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mary Ann Mendes just wants to be strong and move forward. But as she toasts to new beginnings with her best girlfriends, Tori and Kat, she knows it will not be easy. Thanks to a carefully composed Dear John letter, she has finally brought her emotionally abusive relationship with Mark to a screeching halt. Now all Mary Ann is left with is a shattered self-esteem and a broken heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she cautiously embarks into the world of dating once again, she is unsure of herselfand it does not help that her perpetual search for the One causes her to sift through a potpourri of losers. Determined to reinvent herself and overcome her challenges, Mary Ann enrolls in a New York City law school, where she soon meets the handsome and brilliant attorney John Moretti, who introduces her to a new and blissful existence. But Mary Ann has no idea that the door she thought was firmly closed in her past is about to open again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mark reenters her life and threatens all her future dreams, Mary Ann must summon the courage to win back the only man she has ever truly lovedbefore he exits her life forever. &lt;/p&gt;" />
