  <title>Her Super-Secret Rebound Boyfriend - Kerri Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t shy librarian Lola McBride&#39;s idea to crash someone else&#39;s high school reunion. Her best friend made her do it, insisting that having a little fun with a super-hot rebound would make her forget about her recent breakup. That&#39;s when she meets the hottest guy she&#39;s ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Architect Luke Erickson had no idea attending his ten-year reunion would turn out to be so fun. He catches the sexy brunette in a lie, and he counters with a proposal--He&#39;ll keep her secret if she helps get his family off his back by pretending to be his girlfriend at an upcoming family reunion. From one reunion to another, Lola and Luke are suddenly spending a lot of time together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke may be most likely to avoid relationships at all costs and Lola may be most likely to desire a husband, kids, and white picket fence. Good thing they&#39;re only pretending, or this super-secret relationship could get really complicated.&lt;/p&gt;" />
