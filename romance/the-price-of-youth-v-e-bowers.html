  <title>The Price of Youth - V. E. Bowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Price of Youth Is a story about a Vampire named Venia as she tells her story of her struggles with both good and evil, in a life she both loves and hates. Venia is on a quest to find peace; she learns the meaning to the chain of life and family and friends. When Venia has lost all in this world she has ever cared about, she all but gives up. Until one night, a walk through an old cemetery changes everything. When Venia stumbles over something in the ashes of the old church ruins, she finds hope for the peace in which she seeks. With the help of a man of God, her faith, and Valuds love, will they once again be aloud to walk as mortals. As they find themselves hunted by those in which they had made. No longer in control Cartegin an evil vampire now takes the rains, with only one goal, to destroy Venia. When Venia becomes with child Cartegins plans change, then when a white wolf appears before the birth of the child, is it one of Cartegins creatures or a sign from God to help protect her unborn. After the child is born, Venia returns to America in hopes of keeping it safe, all the while knowing that the day they would have to face Cartegin would soon be at hand." />
