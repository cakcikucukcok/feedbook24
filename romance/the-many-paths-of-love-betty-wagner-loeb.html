  <title>The Many Paths of Love - Betty Wagner Loeb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In anguish, Gus Antonelli cries out in the night, For years, Ive lived close to my brothers house, eaten at his table, played with his children, coveted his wife.  Such is the agony of Gus who sacrifices his love for Jenny for the sake of his identical twin Tony. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It all began when Jenny and her dear friend Sara shared a table in a crowded restaurant in Philadelphia with two handsome, charming young men visiting from New York where they were preparing to open an upscale restaurant.   They offered Jenny a job.   Observing the twins, Sara later asks,  I wonder what happens when twins fall in love with the same girl?  
Jennys heart is broken when her father dies, and soon afterwards, Sara commits suicide.  She collapses and is taken by Jonathan Holbrook, whom she met at her fathers funeral, to his psychiatric hospital for a few days.  Returning home, she is haunted by the loss of the two people she loved, so she accepts the job offer and flees to New York.   Maria, the twins mother, invites Jenny to stay with them in a condominium high above Central Park.   The kind, good-natured Antonellis  become her family.  Tony glows with love for Jenny, and she feels the same way about  him.  However, in one unguarded moment, she sees Gus gazing at her like Tony does.  Unable to marry one and hurt the other, she returns home to complete her final year at Drexel University and earn her degree in fashion design. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Desperately poor, Jenny sells her little house and rents a cheap apartment in center city Philadelphia where shes near the university and can work evenings in a department store.   Jonathan finds her and lavishes her with expensive gifts.   One year later, lonely and weary of her struggle, she allows him to trick her into marriage.  He promises to help her to jump-start her career, a promise he immediately breaks, demanding they have a family first because of his age.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jonathans mother, elegant Millicent Holbrook, admires Jennys beauty and talent.  She   gives the couple a lovely Christmas wedding.  She also encourages Jennys ambition and helps her open a boutique  She introduces Jenny to Gary Durant, owner of  a clothing factory in New York.   He hires Jenny to design dresses for him,  also prevails on her to model for him from time to time.  Her talent saves his ailing business.  Gary also introduces Jenny to wealthy businessmen who soon have her designing gowns for their wives and wedding gowns for their daughters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jenny gives Jonathan a son they nickname LJ, meaning little Jon.  Jonathans temper  frightens his already nervous child.   Jonathan becomes jealous of Jennys success as a designer and is perhaps jealous of the interest shown her by his mother, his brother Robert and two 
sisters,  Jill and Myra.  Jonathan spends most of his time at his hospital.  Following the deaths of  both his father and mother, he becomes an alcoholic and suffers a complete breakdown, during which time Jenny nurses him back to health.  A fire at his hospital, in addition to his reckless spending, plunge Jonathan into debt and into the arms of a socialite who bails him out of trouble.  By now, Jenny is quite wealthy, but he refuses her help.   After accidentally seeing  him kissing  the socialite, Jenny has a violent fight with the woman, after which Jonathan strikes Jenny.  She orders him out of the house he had built for her.   When she seeks medical help for her bruised face, she learns shes pregnant but doesnt reveal this to Jonathan until they meet much later at 
Disney World when he is furious and threatens taking custody of the child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After her divorce,  Tony comes to Philadelphia to help Jenny manage her businesses 
which now includes a lingerie factory she inherited from a friend.  They move the factory to the  suburbs, not far from her  boutique thats located in a little Victorian house.
Gus is aware that Jenny knows how he feels about her and is certain shell never" />
