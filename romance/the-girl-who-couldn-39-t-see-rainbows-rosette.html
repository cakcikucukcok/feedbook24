  <title>The girl who couldn&#39;t see rainbows - Rosette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The encounter of two lonely souls in the fascinating context of an imaginary Scottish village is the starting point for a great love story where nothing is like it seems. The main character - Melisande Bruno - is the girl who can&amp;rsquo;t see rainbows, for she is able to see only in black and white. And her opponent, as well as great love, is Sebastian McLaine, a writer relegated to a wheelchair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melisande Bruno flees from her past and refuses to accept her diversity: she was born with a particular and rare sight impairment that prevents her from distinguishing colours and her greatest dream would be to see a rainbow. Her new employer is Sebastian McLaine, a famous writer of horror novels, relegated to a wheelchair due to a mysterious car accident. A figure lies in the shadows, ready to feed on other people&amp;rsquo;s desires... Two solitudes that intertwine; two destinies united by their darkest dreams in which nothing is as it seems. A Gothic novel waiting only to be read..." />
