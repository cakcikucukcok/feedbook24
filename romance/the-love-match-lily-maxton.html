  <title>The Love Match - Lily Maxton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;England, 1818. &lt;/i&gt;To her family, Olivia Middleton is a problem of the most vexing sort. With her older two sisters married off, she is now the target of her mother&#39;s matrimonial scheming. Shy and somewhat plain, Olivia prefers the thrill of a gothic novel to the hunt for a husband. And as far as her family is concerned, something must be done. But Olivia has no interest in the men paraded before her, except, perhaps, the sought-after bachelor William Cross. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William has sworn never to wed, but that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t enjoy women. What he excels at most is flirtation... unless the woman in question is Olivia Middleton. She barely bats an eyelash at his most creative compliments. She laughs at his attempts to flatter her when other ladies would swoon. Olivia intrigues him, particularly when he discovers the passion simmering beneath her facade, a passion that should be to his benefit...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sisters of Scandal series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 The Affair&lt;br&gt;Book #2 The Wager&lt;br&gt;Book #3 The Love Match&lt;br&gt;Book #4 The Mistake&lt;br&gt;Book #5 The Improper Bride&lt;/p&gt;" />
