  <title>One Kiss From You - Christina Dodd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A bold woman known as the &quot;duchess of Magnus&quot; was wagered&amp;#8212;and won&amp;#8212;in a card game. But the woman who arrived was her shy, quiet cousin Eleanor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eleanor de Lacy must have been mad to agree to exchange identities with her stronger-willed cousin. She would never convince Remington Knight of the folly of this union&amp;#8212;especially since the man seemed so determined for it to take place. Worse still, she finds Remington dazzlingly attractive&amp;#8212;and she&#39;s charmed by his attempts to seduce her, even though he believes she is already his. But if he ever learns of Eleanor&#39;s deception, this daring rogue will  wreak havoc . . . upon her reputation and her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remington had expected a haughty, unbending aristocrat who would ensure his entrance into good society. But this &quot;duchess&quot; is a most pleasant surprise&amp;#8212;modest, warm-hearted, endearingly awkward, and a delight to the eye. In short, she is exactly the sort of bride Remington could fall passionately, completely in love with . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; . . . if he weren&#39;t so intent on his revenge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
