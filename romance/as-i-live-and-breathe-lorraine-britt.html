  <title>As I Live and Breathe - Lorraine Britt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life on the run has become second nature to Annalise Crockett.  When a teaching position at a small university in the English countryside falls in her lap, she jumps at the chance. To safeguard herself even more, she signs up for a self-defense class.  As luck would have it the class is being taught by former football player Graham Whittington-James, who Annalise had cheered for in her days at university in England.  Graham is instantly intrigued by her.  He sees how broken, skittish and introverted she is, even though he senses this is not her true self.  He can&#39;t help wanting to protect her, to take care of her.  He is determined to gain her trust, find out why she has all the walls and defenses, and help build her up again. Just as she begins to let down her walls and let Graham in, the familiar sense of being watched returns.  It doesn&#39;t take long for her to know the reason she has stayed on the run has returned once more. This time, will she stand her ground?  Or will Graham lose her forever?" />
