  <title>The Diamond Maker - Joseph M. Orlando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Diamond Maker is a tale of two teens, who overcame adversity and found love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bart &amp;quot;Stutter Boy&amp;quot; DeMarco and &amp;quot;Ugly Angela&amp;quot; Curcuru are 16 year-olds who have suffered emotional abuse from their peers.&lt;br /&gt;
Bart had battled with a severe stutter that effectively silenced him. To speak was to be mocked and ridiculed. School was agony, as were the bullies who delighted in taunting &amp;quot;Stutter Boy&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Angela emigrated from Sicily with her family at the age of 12. While she struggled to learn and speak English, mean girls recognized an easy target and dubbed her &amp;quot;Ugly Angela&amp;quot;. Unable to verbally defend herself, and finding no friends, she, after four years, accepted that she was indeed, &amp;quot;Ugly Angela&amp;quot;. That she was not worthy of love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Man&amp;#39;s great weakness is his ego, Women, her vanity.&lt;br /&gt;
At a moment when Bart was at his lowest, Angela appeared to support him and elevate his spirits, and he, elevated her. Individually, they felt vulnerable, together they were strong and confident.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was the beginning of their love story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
