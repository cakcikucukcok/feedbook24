  <title>Four Weddings and a Werewolf - Kristin Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wedding planner Veronica Vale is a romantic. LIke every other woman, she wants to be wooed. So when a sexy stranger shows up at one of her wedding appointments, Veronica finds it hard to focus on the task at hand. Until she learns he&#39;s there to protect her. Fighting her desire for the former marine is harder than she expects, though, especially when he&#39;s shirtless and mowing her lawn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan Black, bodyguard for the Seattle Wolf Pack, hates weddings and has no plan to walk the path to matrimonial misery. But when he&#39;s hired to covertly protect a hot-to-trot wedding planner with a werewolf stalker, he&#39;s forced to put his feelings aside. Not such an easy task when the damsel can turn him on with a single smoldering glance and she makes him laugh, which is a dangerous combination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Seattle Wolf Pack series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Gone With The Wolf&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Four Weddings and a Werewolf&lt;br&gt;Book #3 So I Married a Werewolf&lt;/p&gt;" />
