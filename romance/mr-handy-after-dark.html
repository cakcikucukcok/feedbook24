  <title>Mr. Handy - After Dark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Shawn is getting back on his feet. He has a pretty lucrative gig working as a handyman for a wealthy couple who owns a log cabin in the mountain. Shawn is great at his job and looks forward to the many other jobs that will eventually come his way. He just can&amp;rsquo;t get finished fast enough with this one because the wealthy couple&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter likes to trounce around him in her bathing suit bottom&amp;mdash;and soon nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Shawn Baxter finished tinkering with the mechanism underneath the hot tub, when he locked the panel shut and rose from the short stool he sat on. He ignored the dense rolling forest stretched out behind him, for the uniformly beautiful woodwork laid out in front of him leading up to the rustic, chalet-style log cabin. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but to admire his hard work over the past few weeks: the wooden stage, the swathed hot tub, the matching liquor bar, the wooden benches and the many wooden accessories such as tables, stands, chairs, and garden boxes; lastly, the massive deck this all sat on that he built and stained with his own two hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A goddamn beaut if I say so myself!&amp;rdquo; Shawn congratulated his efforts in his husky, mountain man tone, wiping his hands of some grease.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t his first rodeo with wood. Shawn always had been a wizard with his hands, especially when it came to woodwork with a few other skills trailing behind a close second. He could build practically anything with his callused mitts. Actually, he did&amp;ndash;for a living at that&amp;ndash;for almost twenty years until the economy tanked and reduced him to a good cheap day laborer in order to survive the current climate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things are really looking up, Shawn beamed, rounding up his tools for his toolbox.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another week remained on his job at this particular cabin with five more jobs in the way to take him through the end of spring&amp;ndash;thanks to his generous employers, owners of the cabin. But his hope was by the time summer came around he might be part of a construction crew thanks to the log cabin boom going on in these parts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shawn made his way through the screened porch pass the second hot tub next to the fireplace, when he saw the likes of a new, shiny, red pickup truck hook around the mountainous driveway. Shawn picked up some speed to run out and stop the driver from coming in any further. He needed a chance to turn his pickup truck around on the narrow asphalt pad, so he didn&amp;rsquo;t risk having to back down the side of an entire mountain if he didn&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The driver behind the wheel obliged and waited for him to execute his three-point turn. Shawn pulled up far enough for the driver of the other truck to follow suit before both reversed back into place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shawn hopped out of his truck first when he heard the door of the red truck pop open. In his haste to correct his dingy, black truck, Shawn was clueless as to who drove the truck. He knew the truck didn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the elderly couple he worked for, so who could this be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shawn walked around to the front of the truck just in time to see its door close. Behind it was this tall tan-legged beauty in a bathing suit bottom. His eyes practically bulged out of their sockets at the sight of this woman walking towards the likes of him." />
