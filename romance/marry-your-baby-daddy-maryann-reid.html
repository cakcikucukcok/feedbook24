  <title>Marry Your Baby Daddy - Maryann Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When their unassuming Grandma June dies, Giovanna, Keyah, and Fatima are shocked to learn she had saved a small fortune and has left three million dollars to them, her granddaughters. But there&#39;s a catch: each sister must marry the father of her children no later than six months after reading the will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piece of cake, right? Wrong! Each sister has a complicated relationship with her &quot;baby daddy.&quot; Giovanna, a successful lawyer and a proudly independent woman, has no desire to marry Douglas---even if he makes her breath catch when he walks in the room and is a wonderful dad to their daughter. She&#39;s got a feeling that Douglas is keeping secrets. Keyah&#39;s boyfriend, Jag slipped a ring on her finger years ago but seems content to stay forever engaged. And Fatima&#39;s on-again, off-again relationship with Dune is filled with more ups and downs than a roller coaster. So why would Grandma June want her granddaughters to marry these men?  Because sometimes Grandma really knows best. The clock is ticking. Will it be a countdown to wedding bells or disaster?&lt;/p&gt;" />
