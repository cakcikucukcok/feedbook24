  <title>The Morning After - Lisa Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;His Victims.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A woman is frantic as she awakens in a dark, closed space. From above her comes the muffled sound of cruel laughter, followed by the hard splatter of dirt. Pure terror takes over as she realizes she&#39;s being buried alive--and her last breath is a scream that no one but a sadistic killer will hear.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will Take His Secrets.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To journalist Nikki Gillette, this disturbing story is a ticket out of small-town Savannah and on to the big time. She&#39;s already given the killer a nickname--The Grave Robber--and she&#39;s spending every minute dogging tough cop Pierce Reed&#39;s investigation, trailing him through Savannah&#39;s deep thickets and crumbling cemeteries.  .  .even though she&#39;s starting to wonder about the secrets he&#39;s keeping.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To The Grave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another body is found. And another. Each gruesome discovery unnerves Nikki a little more.  .  .there&#39;s something familiar about it, something she should know. Now, as a serial killer pulls her ever deeper into his sick game, she has no idea how close she&#39;s getting to the truth--or how deadly it will be.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes an excerpt of Lisa Jackson&#39;s newest novel, Tell Me!&lt;/b&gt;" />
