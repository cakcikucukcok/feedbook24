  <title>Sharing His Sister With Their Father - Ashlee Colette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Warner has been having a torrid, illicit affair with his sister, Madison. When they are caught in the act by their father, their relationship is put in danger. Warner knew their father would punish them for their dirty deeds, but the punishment is not what Warner expected. Can Warner and Madison&amp;rsquo;s love survive their father&amp;rsquo;s wrath?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
They stood there in silence for several moments before her father finally spoke. &amp;ldquo;Show me how he kissed you,&amp;rdquo; he urged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; Madison asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You said this all started with a kiss, right?&amp;rdquo; It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that simple, but she nodded all the same. &amp;ldquo;So show me how he kissed you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She gently touched her lips with her fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her father shook his head. &amp;ldquo;I said show me, Madison.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stared at him in confusion until he grabbed her by the arms and pulled her body flush against his. &amp;ldquo;Dad, please. I don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m not comfortable with this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Show me.&amp;rdquo; Her father&amp;rsquo;s voice was hard enough that she knew not to argue with him. She pushed up onto her toes and pecked him on the lips before quickly pulling away again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes darkened. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not how he kissed you, Madison. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not. That kind of kiss would never lead to you fucking your brother.&amp;rdquo; He tightened his grip on her arms and she winced. &amp;ldquo;Now, show me how he kissed you. For real, this time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stood on her tiptoes again and pressed her mouth against his, this time letting the kiss linger. When she pulled back, her cheeks were red and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t meet his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s still wrong, Madison.&amp;rdquo; He grabbed her chin and forced her to meet his gaze. &amp;ldquo;Did he use his tongue?&amp;rdquo; She was stunned into silence. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a simple question. Did he use tongue?&amp;rdquo; She reluctantly nodded, fearing where this was headed. &amp;ldquo;Show me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, she had to stand on her toes to press her mouth to his, this time running her tongue along his bottom lip. His mouth opened instantly, practically engulfing her own in his eagerness. She cringed as his tongue started sliding over hers in a heated rhythm. As he deepened the kiss, he groaned at how warm her mouth was. When her father&amp;rsquo;s huge hands began to grope her breasts through her t-shirt, she hastily broke the kiss. &amp;ldquo;Dad, what are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In place of an answer, his lips crashed into hers while his hands continued to fondle her tits. Madison shouted into his mouth and attempted to push him away, but he captured both of her small hands in one of his and forced them behind her back. She thrashed against him, desperately trying to escape his unyielding embrace as his mouth continued to ravish hers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he finally broke the kiss, they were both panting and desperate for air. Before she could get a word out, his free hand slid from her breast to between her legs and he began to rub her through her shorts.&lt;br /&gt;
