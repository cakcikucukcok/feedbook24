  <title>The Rancher and the Vet (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (Fatherhood, Book 40) - Julie Benson</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Cowboy, Come Home&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leaving his Colorado home town was the second hardest thing Reed Montgomery ever did—the first was breaking up with Avery McAlister, his high school sweetheart. Now his western roots are calling the citified CEO back to his family ranch to be surrogate dad to his niece, Jess. Of course, he can’t help being pulled back into Avery’s world.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keeping her financially strapped animal shelter open is Avery’s first priority—her second turns out to be helping Reed with his parenting skills. They may be bonding, but her former flame still has some serious explaining to do about the secret that drove him away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The ghosts of the past and a rekindled desire bring Reed and Avery ever closer together. But will Reed embrace his future…as a cowboy, a father, and as the man for Avery?&lt;/p&gt;
