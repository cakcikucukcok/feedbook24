      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Avery Clark loves her life. She travels the world doing a job that keeps her so busy she can&#39;t think about how lonely she is or the fact that she hasn&#39;t had day off in two years.

That is until she runs into billionaire hotel mogul Hayden Wexton, who is absolutely one hundred percent off limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hayden Wexton is a man who knows what he wants. As soon as he sees Avery, he can&#39;t get her out of his head. He&#39;s determined to show her life can be fun and she can still get her work done. Only, the more time he spends with her, the more she gets under his skin. That was definitely not a part of his plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avery never makes mistakes, but with Hayden, well, hell, he might just be the best mistake she&#39;s ever made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Sexy Billionaires series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Right Billionaire, Wrong Wedding&lt;br&gt;Book #2 The Billionaire&#39;s Bet&lt;br&gt;Book #3 The Billionaire&#39;s Paradise&lt;/p&gt;" />
