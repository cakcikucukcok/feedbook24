  <title>Stealing Sophie - Sarah Gabriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Connor MacPherson, a Highland laird turned outlaw, steals a bride to honour a promise, although a wife is the last thing he needs. He mistakenly abducts Sophie&amp;#8212;recently returned from a French convent. Quickly wedded, passionately bedded and now captive, Sophie cannot escape&amp;#8212;but an ancient faery curse decrees that she must never fall in love. How can she get away before the handsome outlaw steals her heart as well? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie&#39;s only weapon is her saintly reputation&amp;#8212;and soon she makes Connor&#39;s life hell by creating heaven around him, gambling that the brigand will let her go just to escape her constant sweetness and womanly influence in his Highland lair. When Connor deliberately employs his reputation as a dark ruffian and a passionate lover, he turns the tables on Sophie&#39;s plans. But as his remarkable bride works her natural magic on him, Connor soon realises that he must shield Sophie from those who want her for their own evil ends&amp;#8212;while protecting his own heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
