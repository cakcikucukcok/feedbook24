          &lt;strong&gt;Better than the first time…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryla Evans is no stranger to tough choices. After growing up watching her mother bounce from one unfaithful man to the next, she’s always been determined not to repeat the same mistakes. So when she catches her college athlete boyfriend cheating on her, all her dreams of love and fidelity are crushed. Saying goodbye to the relationship is Ryla’s only option.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She resolves never to see Noel again, nor tell him how he has irrevocably changed her future… Following a career-ending injury, ex-NBA star Noel Carter has worked hard to reconstruct his life. With an eye on a Congressional seat, he knows he needs a wife to complete his image. What better choice than the passionate woman who has entered his life once again?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Noel has never forgotten Ryla, but she has changed in the past seven years, and she is hiding a little secret that comes with some major consequences. Will their reawakened desire be able to heal past betrayals and broken promises and give them a chance at a bright tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
