  <title>Texan for the Holidays - Victoria Chancellor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christmas Cheer In A Small Texas Town&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No sooner has Scarlett, a hairstylist from Atlanta, Georgia, shouted, &quot;California, here I come!&quot; than her clunker of a car breaks down. There are worse places to be stranded than Brody&#39;s Crossing, especially when hunky local James Brody is dying to show her how they celebrate the holidays in their quaint Texas town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James can&#39;t believe this far-out redhead was planning on spending Christmas without her family. Especially when family means so much to him&amp;#151;it&#39;s why he moved back home. He knows there&#39;s no way he can keep a big-city girl in a place like this for long&amp;#133; but can he keep her here long enough to explore the feelings growing between them? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe so, because even though Scarlett promised herself she&#39;d be in Los Angeles by the New Year, she&#39;s becoming more Texan by the minute! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
