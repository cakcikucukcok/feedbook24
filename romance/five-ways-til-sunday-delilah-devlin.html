He calls on his brothers in blue, four men he trusts with his life. Between the five of them, he&#39;s sure they can check off each and every item on Marti&#39;s bucket list in a one wild, wicked weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Marti has to agree to follow through--and he has to figure out if he can bear to share her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each novella in the Delta Blue series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Five Ways &#39;til Sunday&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Fournicopia&lt;br&gt;Book 3: A Perfect Trifecta&lt;br&gt;Book 4: Twice the Bang&lt;br&gt;Book 5: Once is Never Enough&lt;/p&gt;" />
