  <title>Protecting His Interests - Suzanne Rock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if the roles in the movie &lt;i&gt;Pretty Woman &lt;/i&gt;got switched? Find out in Suzanne Rock&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Protecting His Interests&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After spending months undercover at a high-end escort service, Special Agent Gabriel Ferreira hits a dead end in his case. Then a gorgeous art restorer picks him as her date, and his luck changes in more ways than one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabe won&#39;t let Scarlett Bishop come between him and his goal of taking down Miami&#39;s newest serial killer, no matter how great she is in bed. Unfortunately, the more he tries to distance himself from the sexy redhead, the more tangled up she becomes in his investigation.  Now she has a target on her back, and he must figure out her connection to the killer and keep her safe at the same time. Every second he spends with the sarcastic beauty, he becomes more infatuated. Now if only he can keep his hands off of Scarlett&#39;s gorgeous body and concentrate on his mission before they both become pawns in the killer&#39;s dangerous game.&lt;/p&gt;" />
