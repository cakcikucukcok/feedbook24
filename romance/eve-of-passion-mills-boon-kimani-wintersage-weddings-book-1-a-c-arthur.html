  <title>Eve of Passion (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (Wintersage Weddings, Book 1) - A.C. Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;The Silk Sisters–longtime friends Janelle, Sandra and Vicki–have turned their business savvy into a top-tier event agency. And in the wealthy enclave of Wintersage, Massachusetts, there&#39;s an abundance of lavish parties, society drama and longing hearts to keep them busy. &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Premier event planner Janelle Howerton swore off dating after college. Now her father wants her to make nice with an influential donor to his congressional campaign. After all, it&#39;s just one date….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Ballard Dubois wants to help Darren Howerton win the election. But he wants Darren&#39;s daughter more–and his desires seldom go unfulfilled. Suddenly &quot;one date&quot; quickly spirals into a hot relationship, and celebrity gossip sites crown them the new &quot;it&quot; couple. And when Ballard proposes all of a sudden, Janelle shocks herself by saying…yes!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the wedding date looms, Janelle and Ballard wonder: Is this marriage a mere political ploy? Or could this become a real, lifelong love?&lt;/p&gt;
