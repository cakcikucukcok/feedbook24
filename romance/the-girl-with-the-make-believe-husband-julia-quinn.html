  <title>The Girl With The Make-Believe Husband - Julia Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;While you were sleeping...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her brother Thomas injured on the battlefront in the Colonies, orphaned Cecilia Harcourt has two unbearable choices: move in with a maiden aunt or marry a scheming cousin. Instead, she chooses option three and travels across the Atlantic, determined to nurse her brother back to health. But after a week of searching, she finds not her brother but his best friend, the handsome officer Edward Rokesby. He&#39;s unconscious and in desperate need of her care, and Cecilia vows that she will save this soldier&#39;s life, even if staying by his side means telling one little lie...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I told everyone I was your wife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Edward comes to, he&#39;s more than a little confused. The blow to his head knocked out&amp;#160;three months of his memory, but surely he would recall getting &lt;em&gt;married&lt;/em&gt;. He knows who Cecilia Harcourt is&amp;#8212;even if he does not recall her face&amp;#8212;and with everyone calling her his wife, he decides it must be true, even though he&#39;d always assumed he&#39;d marry his neighbor back in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If only it were true...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecilia risks her entire future by giving herself&amp;#8212;completely&amp;#8212;to the man she loves. But when the truth comes out, Edward may have a few surprises of his own for the new Mrs. Rokesby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
