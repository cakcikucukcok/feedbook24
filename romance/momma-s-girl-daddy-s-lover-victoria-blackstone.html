  <title>Momma’s Girl, Daddy’s Lover - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing compares to the feel of daddy&amp;rsquo;s cock stretching me open, except maybe the taste of momma&amp;rsquo;s hot, wet pussy...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
I took a deep breath, as I reached for the door, willing my father to look up. I figured I had maybe half a minute, at most, to make an impression.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He did look up, his gaze dropping immediately to my chest, where it lingered before moving down. I withheld a smile as I moved to the lounger beside my mother. She slipped her finger into her book as she turned toward me, a look of disbelief forming. &amp;ldquo;Seriously?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I gave her a pleading look.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s you father,&amp;rdquo; she said, only loud enough for me to hear. &amp;ldquo;Why do you insist on teasing the poor man?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re taking alcohol to the beach, Mom, in a car...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The smile left her face then, and she shook her head. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you ever try to bribe me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My brows drew. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She exhaled. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to give you the opportunity to convince me to let you have your way. Don&amp;rsquo;t squander it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I held her gaze for a long moment before turning toward my father. He was sawing a piece of wood, his muscles moving in the most appealing way. &amp;ldquo;I want him...&amp;rdquo; I took and released a calming breath. &amp;ldquo;I want him to think I look sexy,&amp;rdquo; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She broke the short silence. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;d have to be dead not to think you look sexy in that, honey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I turned to meet her gaze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My brows drew. &amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What happens after you get him lusting after you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My breath caught as the butterflies took off in my stomach. I turned back toward him. &amp;ldquo;I lay back and let him have his way with me,&amp;rdquo; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Jesus, baby, he&amp;rsquo;s your father!&amp;rdquo; she hissed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head, staring at his chest. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s the most handsome man I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s your father,&amp;rdquo; she repeated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He loves me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s my husband,&amp;rdquo; she said, her tone a quiet whisper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I met her gaze. &amp;ldquo;He would be gentle. I would be safe, in my own bed, not in the back seat of some car, with some inexperienced dork.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She chuckled. &amp;ldquo;You think you have this all figured out, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t. All I know is that I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She held my gaze a few moments before shifting it to my chest. &amp;ldquo;Put some lotion on, before you burn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop the smile, and as I reached for the tube, I shifted my gaze, watching as he straightened, his gaze moving first to me then to my mother then back. I glanced to the side, surprised to see her head back and her eyes closed. I returned my gaze to his, holding it as I squeezed lotion into my hand and began to work the stuff into my foot and lower leg. I leaned forward even more, my breasts bracketing one knee, and I knew that, from his perspective, the view would be hard to ignore. When I finished with my feet and legs I lowered them, then went to work on my stomach. I met his gaze again when I began to massage my breasts, purposely allowing my fingers to slip under the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is he watching you do that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded, unable to stop the smile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She laughed softly. &amp;ldquo;Naughty girl.&amp;rdquo;" />
