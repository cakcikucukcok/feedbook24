  <title>To Sin With a Stranger - Kathryn Caskie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven Sinclair brothers and sisters live for scandal and delight in disgrace . . . until their father decrees that they must reform. Propriety has never come easily, but now they have no choice. Marry in haste . . . or regret in poverty!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sinclairs of Scotland are known throughout society as the Seven Deadly Sins. Cast out by their father and denied their inheritance unless they mend their wild ways, they travel to London to seek respectability. No member of the clan is more scandalous than Sterling Sinclair, the Marquess of Blackburn. The ladies of the ton are powerless to withstand his rakish charms . . . until Miss Isobel Carington comes along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten thousand pounds if she marries Sinclair!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isobel is horrified to learn that&#39;s the amount wagered at White&#39;s Club&amp;#8212;and now all of London is eagerly betting on her future! She&#39;s already publicly spurned the marquess, a man she hardly knows, but she&#39;s sure he is up to something, as he launches a bold campaign of seduction anyway. But soon she is surprised to learn there is much more to this man than reckless adventure and bad behavior . . . and, against her will, she begins to relish the thrill of sinning with this stranger . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
