  <title>Betraying the Billionaire - Victoria Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Julian Worth isn&#39;t a man with time to spare. Ruling his billion dollar empire with an iron fist, work is the true love of his life. Which is why when it comes to marriage, a strategic alliance matters more than love. Julian is more than ready to sign on for a little superficial dating and a marriage of convenience if it allows him to take his company to the next level. What he wasn&#39;t ready for was the woman who shows up as his prospective bride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holly Abbott has spent her whole life coming in second. Being born four minutes behind her twin sister has defined her life. But when her headstrong sister refuses to go along with their father&#39;s plan to marry her off into a cold business arrangement, Holly has to step up. Knowing the infamous Julian Worth will only entertain marrying the Abbott heir, Holly sets her identity aside to transform into her sister. It&#39;s an easy enough plan. A few dates with a man who isn&#39;t hers won&#39;t hurt anyone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except Julian is nothing like the ruthless tycoon she expected. Soon she&#39;s left to wonder, what will happen when her sister comes back and worse, how will she ever be able to give up a man who doesn&#39;t even know her real name?&lt;/p&gt;" />
