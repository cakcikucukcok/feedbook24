  <title>Perfect for You - Candis Terry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet the Kincade brothers: they&amp;#8217;ll do what it takes to protect their legacy&amp;#8212;but what happens when love gets in the way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declan Kincade has spent so much time chasing success he&amp;#8217;s almost forgotten how to just live. Lately, though, his all-business routine has been thrown into disarray. Brooke Hastings is the best employee Dec&amp;#8217;s ever had: polished, capable, and intelligent. After four years, he&amp;#8217;s just realized that she&amp;#8217;s also smoking hot. But their working relationship is too valuable to stake on a fling, no matter how mind-bendingly pleasurable it promises to be . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s worse than never meeting the right man? Finding him, and then working side-by-side every day while he remains absolutely blind to your existence. That is, until one temptation-packed road trip changes everything. Teaching her gorgeous, driven boss how to cut loose and have fun is the toughest challenge Brooke&amp;#8217;s ever faced. But it&amp;#8217;s one that could give both of them exactly what they need, if Dec will take a chance on a perfect&amp;#8212;and perfectly unexpected&amp;#8212;love . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
