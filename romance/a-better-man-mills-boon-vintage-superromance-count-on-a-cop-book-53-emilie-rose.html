  <title>A Better Man (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (Count on a Cop, Book 53) - Emilie Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Roth Sterling is a straight shooter, a guy you want on your side. As a soldier, he defended his country. As a cop, he upholds the law. For a kid who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, he&#39;s done well for himself. Now he&#39;s back in his hometown, only this time, he&#39;s the new police chief.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;s in for a few surprises, however. Piper Hamilton–the girl he loved–still has the power to move him. And they are tied together thanks to the son he didn&#39;t know he had. Roth is determined to do right by Piper, whatever it takes. Even if it means becoming the one thing he never thought to be–a family man.&lt;/p&gt;
