        &lt;p&gt;Workaholic single father Wade Abbot is away on business, as usual, when he receives a heart-tugging video from his four-year-old. The little girl hopes he&#39;ll come home for Christmas–and see her in the holiday pageant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With his harrowing past, Wade has always doubted his ability to be a good father, but he heads home to Arizona, determined to try. His daughter&#39;s loving new nanny, Connie Ladden, works overtime to help turn him into the father he longs to be. And with some help from his little girl, Wade just might turn his holiday nanny into a permanent wife and mother.&lt;/p&gt;
