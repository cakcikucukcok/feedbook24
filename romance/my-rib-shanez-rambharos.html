  <title>My Rib - Shanez Rambharos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Starting over is always difficult.&lt;br&gt;
Starting over in a foreign city without family and friends is even more difficult.&lt;br&gt; 
Add the ever-arrogant Eli to the mix, and then it&#39;s just a field day.&lt;br&gt; 
In hell!&lt;br&gt; 
My mantra is to stay the hell away from him and disappear from his life as soon as I can, preferably in the middle of the night, leaving a handwritten good-bye on a sticky note.&lt;br&gt; 
My name is Sarah, and this is my story of how life has a way of screwing up the best-laid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do when the woman you promised to marry and spend the rest of your life with is not what your heart wants anymore?&lt;br&gt;
And what do you do when the one your heart wants, wants nothing to do with you?&lt;br&gt; 
Just when I thought I had it all figured out, destiny threw a monkey wrench into my simple equation of a life.&lt;br&gt;
Sarah came into my life like a tsunami, knocked me down senseless, and turned my world upside down.&lt;br&gt; 
I am still not sure if I am permanently oxygen deficient or if she just has the effect of leaving me panting and breathless.&lt;br&gt; 
My name is Elijah, and this is the story of how love makes us crazy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
