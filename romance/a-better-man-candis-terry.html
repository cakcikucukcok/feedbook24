  <title>A Better Man - Candis Terry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet the Kincade brothers: they&amp;#8217;ll do what it takes to protect their legacy&amp;#8212;but what happens when love gets in the way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hockey star Jordan Kincade wasted no time ditching Sunshine Valley and everyone who mattered for a career in the NHL&amp;#8212;a truth Jordan confronts when his parents&amp;#8217; deaths bring him home. Now he&amp;#8217;s back to make amends, which begins with keeping his younger sister from flunking out of school. It&amp;#8217;s just his luck that the one person who can help is the girl whose heart he broke years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy Diamond has racked up a number of monumental mistakes in her life, the first involving a certain blue-eyed charmer. She has no intention of falling for Jordan Kincade again, but when he shows up asking her to help one of her students, Lucy just can&amp;#8217;t say no. Worse, the longer he&amp;#8217;s back, the more she sees how much he&amp;#8217;s changed. And so when a blistering kiss turns to more, she can&amp;#8217;t help but wonder if her heart will be crushed again . . . or if she&amp;#8217;ll discover true love with a better man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
