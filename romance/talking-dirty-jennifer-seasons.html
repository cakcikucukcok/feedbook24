  <title>Talking Dirty - Jennifer Seasons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jake Stone has always been an outsider, even in his hometown. As the misfit son of the town drunk and a descendant of Fortune&amp;#8217;s mysterious founders, he&amp;#8217;s spent his whole life not living up to expectations. So when Apple Woodman comes poking her pert little nose around his business, trying to sniff out juicy bits for a book she&amp;#8217;s writing on the town&amp;#8217;s history, he decides he&amp;#8217;s had enough. He&amp;#8217;ll give her the answers, at a price: one piece of clothing for every question. If the town&amp;#8217;s good girl librarian wants the dirt on this bad boy then she&amp;#8217;s going to have to bare all to get it.&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing is going to stop Apple from achieving her dream of being a published author, not even surly Jake Stone. She&amp;#8217;s got a hefty advance to make good on and a looming deadline, and the last bit of crucial information she needs is being held hostage by the infuriating man. But Apple believes in equality between the sexes and she&amp;#8217;s not going to be the only one playing along&amp;#8212;he&amp;#8217;s going to have to take it all off too. They&amp;#8217;re only clothes; it&amp;#8217;s not like they&amp;#8217;re baring their hearts. Right?&lt;/p&gt;" />
