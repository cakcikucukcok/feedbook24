          &lt;strong&gt;Claire Quinn has a perfect ife–in her dreams&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In reality, she has an advertising job headed for permanent entry-level, a pricey apartment and a rat of a boyfriend. So now she has to make her wish come true.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But she can get this figured out, right? She just has to hit on the plan and her life will get better. Good thing she has the Chickateers–her loyal girlfriends who regularly dish on their love lives, but never snivel! With their smart-ass outlooks and cheeky advice guiding her, how can she go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except that it turns out her ad exec mentor is a closet lecher, her new roommate is a little, uh, &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt; and the cute guy who just captured her attention? He&#39;s got a no-attachments, no-regrets mantra that doesn&#39;t fit the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Looks as if she&#39;s going to have to stop following her own advice.&lt;/p&gt;
