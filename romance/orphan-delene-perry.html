  <title>Orphan - Delene Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A YOUNG WOMAN MUST LEARN THE TRUTH BEHIND HER CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE SHE CAN RECONCILE HER PAST AND OPEN HER HEART TO THE LOVE OF HER SUITOR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Lila Jo Brewsters life is turned upside down when her father, a widower, enters into a marriage of convenience with Martha Adams, a widow with two young daughters. It isnt long before Jo begins to experience mental and physical abuse at the hands of her stepmother and stepsisters. When Martha and Jos father have a son together, things grow even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jos father soon sees something is wrong and takes Jo to a childrens home, promising to return for her. The child applies herself to learn to read and write in order to beg her father to come get her. When her letters go unanswered, however, Jo wonders what is wrong. Is her father dead? Does he not love her? Is she truly an orphan now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jo turns sixteen, she is sent to a wealthy family across the country to be the nanny to four children. There she meets and falls in love with the brother of her employer. Clay Logan falls for the beautiful young girl and, after a long courtship, finally persuades her she is worthy of his love. He takes Jo to her home to learn the answers to the questions that have plagued her for so many yearsand the truth that they learn astonishes them both.&lt;/p&gt;" />
