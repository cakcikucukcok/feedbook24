  <title>Whispers from the Soul - Elaine Doll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stripped of everything but her grief and left alone in the desolate Oklahoma Territory, Leoma Fisk
is asked to do the unthinkable. She has buried both her husband and their infant daughter, and she feels as if all hope is lost. When Welby Soderlund, a stranger, approaches her at her daughters graveside, she is forced to make an impossible decision under impossible circumstances. Can she struggle through her fresh grief to make the life-changing sacrifice he desperately needs for his own infant son to survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw with his own grief, Welby explains that his wife has died, and now, Dyer, their infant son, is starving. Leomas milk could be this childs only hope for life. But can she find the strength in her faith to answer his prayers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging deep within, she opens her heart to the man and his baby after gentle whispers from God guide her. In obedience, she rises above her grief to care for the child, relying on her faith for compassion and strength to nurse little Dyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prim and proper city lady of means, she finds the boys fathera contentious farmer intolerable, yet as she becomes enmeshed in their lives, she grows to love the baby and his older sister. In impossible circumstances, both lives are touched by compassion, love, and even romance. &lt;/p&gt;" />
