&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hear a combination of footsteps and giggles coming down the alley, but it only sounds like one person. I glance up at the clock-he&amp;#39;s actually on time. I&amp;#39;m surprised. I pick up a new rag from my workbench and wipe the grease and polish from my hands. As he approaches I hear a hard snorting sound, followed by more giggles. My eyes narrow and I reach behind me, touching the gun that&amp;#39;s tucked into my belt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The guy appears in the doorway to my garage. If it weren&amp;#39;t for the fact that I&amp;#39;d been expecting him, I might not have pegged him as the same guy. Today he&amp;#39;s wearing a custom-tailored suit, his hair gelled and styled. His shoes look like Italian leather and he&amp;#39;s got a Rolex on one wrist. But his eyes are glassy and dilated, his face is dripping with sweat, and there&amp;#39;s a white powdery residue just under both nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yeah, this is the same guy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey! Motorcycle Man!&amp;quot; he shouts out, his voice too loud for the small space of my garage. He darts his head around, looking in all directions before settling back on me. &amp;quot;You got my bike ready?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nod to the machine sitting mere feet in front of him and he looks down, his expression changing to one of bewilderment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Whoa! This thing looks brand-new!&amp;quot; he shouts. He starts walking around it, admiring my work. My hands clean, I toss the rag back onto the workbench and take a step forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You really did a number on this machine,&amp;quot; I told him. &amp;quot;You gotta be more careful when you drive. A lot fewer people are gonna get hurt that way.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah yeah,&amp;quot; he mumbles, still looking closely at the bike. Suddenly he straightens up, focusing on me again. This time he&amp;#39;s so close I can almost smell the sweat coming off of him. It smells stale, like gym gear left in a locker for too long. &amp;quot;So, uh ... how much did I pay you again, for this?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My eyes narrow just a bit as I regard him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Three grand,&amp;quot; I say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The guy nods. &amp;quot;Mm, yeah, right. Three grand, three grand.&amp;quot; I watch him closely, my entire body tensed. &amp;quot;Mm, yeah, you know, it uh, it sounds like you&amp;#39;re doing pretty well for yourself then.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shrug. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m doing all right.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiles. &amp;quot;Mm-hmm, yeah? Well uh, here. Let me give you a tip for all your hard work.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His hand reaches down and across himself, dipping inside of his suit jacket. But before he can bring out his gun I have mine already in my hand. I grab onto his wrist with my other hand as I bring the barrel of my gun up to his head. He freezes, not moving, not trying to pull away. I stare at him as he stares at the gun pointing at him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ah ah ah,&amp;quot; I say in a low voice. &amp;quot;That would be a bad idea, now wouldn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The guy swallows, and then nods his head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t want to make some sort of mistake that you might come to regret, now do you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The guy is about to nod, but then shakes his head instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Give me the gun,&amp;quot; I say, and he doesn&amp;#39;t resist as I slide my hand down to his, taking the weapon out of his grasp. I bring it up so it&amp;#39;s in my eyeline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A revolver,&amp;quot; I say to him, impressed. &amp;quot;Nice piece.&amp;quot;" />
