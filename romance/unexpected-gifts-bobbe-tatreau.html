  <title>Unexpected Gifts - Bobbe Tatreau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kate Standard had never wanted her life to be ordinary.&lt;P&gt;
A successful classical pianist and the girlfriend of move-hero Will Hollister, her life is anything but ordinary-until Will is jailed on drug charges and she must admit to herself that their affair had been dying long before his conviction. Even worse, the ugly publicity surrounding his case has all but destroyed her professional career.&lt;P&gt; 
To escape the ever-present paparazzi, she accepts a temporary teaching job at a small college near San Diego, going from a high profile, luxurious lifestyle to living in a granny flat, cooking and cleaning for herself, and shepherding ten piano students through their first semester. Though she thinks she is simply marking time until her agent can get her new bookings, Kate finds that the months at Seaton College test her courage but give her gifts she didn&#39;t know she needed." />
