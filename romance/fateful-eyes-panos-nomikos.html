  <title>Fateful Eyes - Panos Nomikos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Much to his chagrin, Peter has been on tortuous and twisted path for fifteen years. As he moves through life in a foreign country without real satisfaction or achievement, he knows he is ready to reach the final destination of his journey. But it is only after he boards a plane to Frankfurt, Germany, that Peter finally feels he is on his way to solving a great puzzle. He is ready to end the search of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Peters wife knows where he is headed. As his aircraft leaves the ground in Greece, Peter begins recalling the events that led to this moment. After he received mysterious text and e-mail messages while working in the Philippines four years earlier, Peter soon discovered a mysterious woman had been looking for him for years. Too busy with his work to pay much attention, Peter brushed her off, not realizing what an important person she was in his life, coming all the way from his youthful, lustful past. As Peter struggles to learn the womans identity, he becomes unwittingly entangled in the unpredictable upheavals that accompany the new millennium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fateful Eyes&lt;/i&gt; is a story of one mans quest to comprehend fates dizzying gaze as he searches for love and true fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
