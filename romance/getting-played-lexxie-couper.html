She also knows everyone who&#39;s anyone in Australia&#39;s music industry, which is why Jaxon Campbell is sure she can help him and his band find a perfect new lead singer. Trouble is, the last time he saw her, he kind of broke her heart and stole her cherished, autographed AC/DC album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie doesn&#39;t want to feel anything when Jaxon strides into her office after all these years, but she does. And if he&#39;s going to ask something from her, well, she wants something from him. Orgasms. Lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can Jax say no to that? He&#39;s never forgotten Natalie, and it&#39;s not like they&#39;re going to fall in love. But just who&#39;s playing who? And whose heart is going to fall first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Heart of Fame series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Love&#39;s Rhythm&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Muscle for Hire&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Guarded Desires&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Steady Beat&lt;br&gt;Book #5 Lead Me On&lt;br&gt;Book #6 Blame it on the Bass&lt;br&gt;Book #7 Getting Played&lt;br&gt;Book #8 Blackthorne&lt;/p&gt;" />
