      <meta name="description" content="Ila, a renowned artist, is known to keep dark secrets from her friends. Whenever her paintings are sold, Ila indulges in two fantasiesjewels and men. She is married to Raana, who loves dogs while she detests them, causing a drift in their already strained marriage. Maya, the gullible, middle-class girl at college, was ridiculed by Ila and her friends. Maya lives a secured life with her husband, Madan. After his untimely death, Maya happens to read his diary, which was the turning point of her life. The word cheated, which appeared on two different dates, turns her world upside down, and she loses her love and respect for the man whom she had once loved. A sudden turn of events helps Maya land a plum job at Raanas company that eventually results in a complete shift in Mayas personality, turning her from an unassuming person to a gregarious socialite. Discover how impetuous emotions lead to intertwining of the lives of three very different people, altering their lives for better or for worse." />
