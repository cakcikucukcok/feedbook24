  <title>Double Dare, Daddy! - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Greg Kennedy had it all - a wonderful wife and two gorgeous step-daughters. But when Madison and Morgan decide that their step-father is the man of their dreams, his life turns upside down! Who will win, and who will lose, when a pair of horny twins take the reins? Buckle up for a wild ride in &amp;quot;Double Dare, Daddy!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Morgan looked up at him, her blue eyes dark with love. &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s how it is, Daddy,&amp;quot; she whispered. &amp;quot;If you want us to stop, we will. I made Maddie promise me that, last night, when we were talking about this.&amp;quot; She shot a look over his shoulder, aimed, Greg assumed, at her twin. &amp;quot;We won&amp;#39;t take what you don&amp;#39;t want to give us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But we want you. Both of us want you. Can you give us this one thing? Just once?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I dare you, Daddy.&amp;quot; A teasing whisper from behind him, followed by a lick at the back of his neck that made his knees shake.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I double-dare you, Daddy.&amp;quot; And Morgan stripped off her shirt, showing him her spectacular body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We love you. Both of us. And we want to take you to bed. Both of us.&amp;quot; Her long, tapering fingers caressed the skin on her belly, and Greg couldn&amp;#39;t help but notice how her small white teeth caught at her lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was stupid. Insane. He ought to be committed to an asylum just for considering it. But instead of a harsh command that his daughters take their hands off him, put their clothes back on, and never bring up such a catastrophically misguided idea ever again, he heard his voice whispering, &amp;quot;Who first?&amp;quot;" />
