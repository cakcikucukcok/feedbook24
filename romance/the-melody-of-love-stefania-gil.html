  <title>The Melody Of Love - Stefania Gil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eve Collins is an independent woman, a little impulsive, and her eternal struggle for women&#39;s rights keeps moving further away from its original concept, which intimidates all men who approach her. She is the public relations assistant of the Fashion View magazine, and, in addition, the person in charge of all those involved in the campaign &quot;Be Yourself&quot;, among them Liam Woods, the vocalist and lead guitarrist of X69, one of the most famous bands in the country which has lately been on everyone&#39;s lips due to Liam&#39;s imprudent behaviour with alcohol and women.
Eve will have to set the vocalist&#39;s behaviour straight and clean up the name of the band, however, in this process, she will learn some things that may change her own destiny and, why not, bond her and Liam together.
Author note: This book is the second of the Sisters Collins Trilogy. Each book of this trilogy is self-conclusive and they can be read in any order, but if you don&#39;t like spoilers, I advice you to read them in the right order :)&lt;br/&gt;
Stefania Gil is also the author of other novels in Romance and the subgenre of Paranormal Romance: The Origin - Special Abilites Division SAD 1, Archangelos Series, My last: Yes, I do, Presagies, Sinchrony, among others.*&lt;br/&gt;" />
