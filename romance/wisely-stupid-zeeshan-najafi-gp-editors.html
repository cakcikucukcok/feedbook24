  <title>Wisely Stupid - Zeeshan Najafi, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jako had everything which a man at 24 can desire for, he was confident and he had anticipated his future. In spite of seeming completeness, he suffered from inner chaos and restlessness which resulted in constant panic attacks. And suddenly everything stopped and he was helpless. He recognizes his incurable illness and decides to end his life but fortunately he fails before the attempt. But, his destiny unfolds a rare experience and he sees things which he thought did not exist.&lt;br /&gt;
He leaves everything that he possessed behind and sets off on a random journey. Jako travels and experiences things which were beyond his imagination. He meets people who deceive and delude him, though he travelled to find answers, Jako returns home with treachery and delusion. On his way back, Jako reaches a small town with an isolated beach. He stays there meets a mysterious traveler; at first, Jako was confused to consider this man as a guardian angel or a mentalist. But as time passes they get along and this mysterious man solves all the riddles that surround Jako. They both sit at the beach and discuss life, Destiny, Freewill, Dreams, Dejavu&amp;#39;s, Reality, Hypocrisy, Philosophy, Pleasure, God, Beauty, Love, Infatuation, Psychology, Wisdom, Intellect, Happiness, Boredom. Jako throws strange questions at this man and he answers them with wise stories. Jako answers all his questions by himself.&lt;br /&gt;
Jako finishes his remarkable journey and returns home rehabilitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeeshan Najafi hails from Bangalore. Currently he is working in Amazon.com. He is a Business Management graduate and persuing his Master&amp;#39;s Degree in Philosophy. He is fond of sufi literature and he enjoys reading Mysticism, Philosophy and Poetry.&lt;br /&gt;
