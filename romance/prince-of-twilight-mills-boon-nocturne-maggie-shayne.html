  <title>Prince of Twilight (Mills &amp; Boon Nocturne) - Maggie Shayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Foretold centuries ago, it is a destiny they cannot escape…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Far older than his legend, the immortal Vlad Dracul has wandered for centuries in search of the reincarnation of his wife, Elisabeta. Now he believes he has found the woman possessed by his beloved&#39;s soul and is prepared to make her his for all eternity. Tempest &quot;Stormy&quot; Jones is that mortal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She has long sensed the other, someone inside her fighting to take control, a feeling that becomes even stronger when the dark prince is near. But as Stormy denies the passion that burns between them, she also resists allowing Elisabeta to take over her mind and body to prevent her from claiming Vlad as her own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when Elisabeta discovers Vlad&#39;s feelings for Stormy, her wrath knows no bounds. She demands that her destiny be fulfilled, and seeks to destroy her rival, leaving Vlad in anguish, tormented by what was…and what could be. Now only he can choose–who will live and who will die.&lt;/p&gt;
