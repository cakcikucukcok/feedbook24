      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tessa Marshal agreed to make her last night in Mexico memorable, but she didn&#39;t expect that to include being dragged out of her car in the middle of the night. She wakes up to find herself bound on the floor of a cartel safe-house, having to account for her part in a double-cross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kristopher &quot;Kris&quot; Harmon has spent years undercover climbing the ranks within the Mexican cartel. He walks a tight line between vicious drug runners with agendas of their own and working with the cartel leaders he&#39;s trying to organize. Any distraction could prove fatal for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their worlds collide when Tessa is mistaken for a drug mule and taken captive. As time runs out for both of them, Tessa has to reach beyond her fears and trust a stranger while Kris must choose between his lifelong ambitions and saving Tessa&#39;s life. If they want to survive, both must trust that there is more to the other than what meets the eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books in the Dangerous Desire series:&lt;br&gt;Desire and Deception&lt;br&gt;Secrets and Seduction&lt;br&gt;Temptation and Treachery&lt;/p&gt;" />
