  <title>Locked In Temptation (The Protectors, Book 3) - Brenda Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;His job is to protect her…no matter the cost&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Police detective Joy Ingram&#39;s connection to elite security expert Stonewall Courson is instant. Undeniable. Electric. But her commitment to protect and serve has always come first. Everything else is secondary—especially when she uncovers an underground surrogate baby-making ring. Joy can&#39;t risk a distraction during the most important case of her career, not even one as sexy as reformed ex-con Stonewall.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are few things Stonewall values more than a strong woman. But when Joy&#39;s investigation draws her into a deadly conspiracy that goes deeper than she ever imagined, he must convince her that he&#39;s the best man to protect her. And while he puts his life on the line to save hers, the insatiable attraction between them becomes the one danger neither of them can escape.&lt;/p&gt;
