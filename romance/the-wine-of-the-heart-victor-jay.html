  <title>The Wine of the Heart - Victor Jay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Junior college teacher Glen Sanford is having problems with his wife, Ann...sexual problems. Basically, he can&#39;t perform on demand, and Ann has lost her patience; she wants a divorce. Then Glen meets a troubled student, Jerry Allen, who&#39;s been tested as having an exceptional IQ, but whose grades have failed to match his intelligence. Glen discovers that Jerry&#39;s being pimped out by his own mother, who&#39;s making money from forcing the boy to liaison with older men. The basic conflict in the student&#39;s life is destroying his psyche. Glen offers him compassion and learning...and eventually love, but the campus gossip-monger spots Jerry coming and going from Glen&#39;s house. The teacher is forced to choose: either give up his new-found love, or resign his academic post. Another poignant gay romance by a master writer." />
