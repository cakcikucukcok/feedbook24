  <title>The Dragon&#39;s Treasure - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="USA Today Bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seven incredible kingdoms, eight sexy tales of love, angst, and adventure! This contemporary fairy tale series will take you to a world filled with dragons, merpeople, pirates, witches, monsters, Elementals, and a lonely king who desperately needs some hope...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Choose your treasure carefully, thief&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Drago, King of the Isle of Dragons, is the last of the magnificent dragons of the Seven Kingdoms. Bitter and alone, he abandons the emptiness of his realm and retreats to the caverns beneath the palace. In the form of his dragon, he remains hidden from the world, protecting the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Heart, the last legacy of his people &amp;ndash; until he is disturbed by a most unlikely thief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carly Tate&amp;rsquo;s trip to Yachats State Park takes a turn when she is caught in a sudden storm. Seeking shelter, she stumbles through a magical doorway into a cavern filled with treasure! Yet, as incredible as the piles of glittering gold and jewels are, her gaze is transfixed by the slumbering form of a magnificent dragon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carly&amp;rsquo;s appearance begins a series of events that will not only change Drago&amp;rsquo;s life, but will affect all of the Seven Kingdoms. Can a centuries-old dragon protect his most valuable treasure, or will the evil that destroyed his race take Carly from him as well?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of romance and adventure. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid scenes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
