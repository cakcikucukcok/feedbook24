  <title>See Jane Score - Rachel Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is Jane. A little subdued. A little stubborn. A little tired of going out on blind dates with men who drive vans with sofas in the back, Jane Alcott is living the Single Girl existence in the big city. She is also leading a double life. By day, she&amp;#8217;s a reporter covering the raucous Seattle Chinooks hockey team&amp;#8212;especially their notorious goalie Luc Martineau. By night, she&amp;#8217;s a writer, secretly creating the scandalous adventures of &amp;#8220;Honey Pie&amp;#8221;, the magazine series that has all the men talking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luc has made his feelings about parasite reporters&amp;#8212;and Jane&amp;#8212;perfectly clear. But if he thinks he&amp;#8217;s going to make her life miserable, he&amp;#8217;d better think again. For as long as he can remember, Luc has been single-minded about his career. The last thing he needs is a smart-mouthed, pain-in-the-backside reporter digging into his past and getting in his way. But once the little reporter sheds her black and gray clothes in favor of a sexy red dress, Luc sees that there is more to Jane than originally meets the eye.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to take a risk. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to live out fantasies. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to...See Jane Score. &lt;/p&gt;" />
