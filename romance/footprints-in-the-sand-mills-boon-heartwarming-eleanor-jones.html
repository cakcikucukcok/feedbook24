  <title>Footprints in the Sand (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) - Eleanor Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Elsa May Malone was only five when the sea took away her beloved father. Traumatized, angry and forced to leave her home on the Cumbrian coast, she became hostile and withdrawn. Then she met Bryn Evans, a kind-hearted boy who’d experienced loss, too. Slowly, Elsa began to let down her barriers – until she and Bryn were torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alone again, Elsa was sure of one thing: Everyone she loved would eventually leave her. When Bryn and Elsa finally reunite, Elsa’s determined not to let her true feelings show. But they’re grown up now, and Bryn clearly hopes their childhood friendship can become something more. Elsa is painfully aware that love can be as serene and yet as terrifying as the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But can she let Bryn into her heart before she loses him a second time?&lt;/p&gt;
