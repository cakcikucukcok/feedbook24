  <title>Stand By You - A.M. Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three months after his rescue from an abusive boyfriend, twenty-two-year-old Romy Myers has landed his first legitimate job&amp;#151;bussing tables at his friend&amp;#39;s new coffee shop. The job has brought him some stability after years of abuse have left him feeling damaged and broken. He&amp;#39;s working hard on his panic and social anxiety, and those things are often tempered by the big, burly presence of Brendan Walker.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;From the moment ex-football player Brendan helped rescue Romy from his ex&amp;#39;s abuse, he&amp;#39;s wanted to protect him. And he does, from a distance, with joking text messages, a new gym routine to toughen him up and a genuine friendship. So far it&amp;#39;s been easy&amp;#151;but Brendan&amp;#39;s feelings aren&amp;#39;t just friendly anymore&amp;#133;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;When an argument spirals out of control, a hot and heavy make-out session causes Romy&amp;#39;s friendship with supposedly straight Brendan to reach a new level. The last thing Romy wants is to fall for another guy who could potentially shatter him, but Brendan also wakes up a part of him he thought had been destroyed by violence&amp;#151;his heart.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;76,000 words" />
