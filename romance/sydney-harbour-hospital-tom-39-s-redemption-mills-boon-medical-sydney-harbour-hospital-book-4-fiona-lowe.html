        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Sydney Harbour Hospital’s most elusive – and eligible – doctor has returned…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Surgical registrar Hayley Grey knows all the gossip about renowned former head of neurosurgery Tom Jordan – he lived for his job, shunned relationships, and two years ago he disappeared. Now he’s back and his secret is out. Tom’s blind and will never operate again. No wonder he’s the proudest, rudest man she’s ever met – but that doesn’t stop her being drawn to his powerful charisma!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There’s no denying the chemistry between them is mind-blowing, but there could be so much more if only Tom would let Hayley see the man behind the mask…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Sydney Harbour Hospital From saving lives to sizzling seduction, these doctors are the very best!&lt;/em&gt;
