  <title>Summer&#39;s Song - Allie Boniface</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Summer Thompson doesn&#39;t remember the night her brother died, and she certainly doesn&#39;t want to go back to Pine Point and face any memories that might be awoken there. But ten years after leaving her small hometown, she&#39;s back to settle her estranged father&#39;s estate and be rid of the half-renovated mansion she&#39;s inherited. What she doesn&#39;t expect is to find the house occupied by a hunky handyman reluctant to talk about his past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damian Knight has been helping his mother and sister hide from a brutal stalker, but now the peace and carefully guarded safety they&#39;ve found in Pine Point is in danger. The refuge they live in is about to be sold out from under them by the lovely but haunted Summer, a woman who quickly finds her way through Damian&#39;s defenses and steals his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a small town full of powerful secrets, the past won&#39;t remain buried. Summer has to face her memories and could lose the man she loves, and maybe even her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Pine Point series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1: Summer&#39;s Song&lt;br&gt;Book #2: Winter Wonder&lt;br&gt;Book #3: Spring Secrets&lt;br&gt;Book #4: Autumn Allure&lt;/p&gt;" />
