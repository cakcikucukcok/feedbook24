  <title>The Paradox of Damian - Clinton &quot;Jawad&quot; Pace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Paradox Of Damian is about love and family...but I&#39;m open for argument. Some will argue that &#39;The Paradox Of Damian&#39; is about hate. And I understand...after all a lot of people die in this book. If I have to argue, I think that one of my arguments will be for one to study the parables that dom the pages of the great spiritual book called the Bhagavad Gita; a book studied by such as the likes of a Albert Einstein.It was the great Mahatma Ghandi who called the Bhagavad Gita &quot;Spiritual Mother.&quot; In essence I believe that the main characters in &#39;The Paradox Of Damian&#39;kill out of love and not hate.  
The Paradox Of Damian&#39; touches on politics. My personal opinion is that one&#39;s politics doesn&#39;t matter. If the underline theme in one&#39;s heart isn&#39;t about love, then they probably shouldn&#39;t read this book...there are many millions more to read. 
And last but certainly not least, if in this new millennium one is racist, or are offended by gay people, or both, then you probably shouldn&#39;t read this book-there are many books out there for you too. Rather one reads this book or not, thanks for reading period.
