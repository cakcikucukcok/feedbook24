  <title>Destiny’S Gamble - Jenn Shell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Destiny Moretti is, by all standards, a lucky woman. Born into a family who possesses both great wealth and power, she is loved and has the world at her feet. She knows how to get what she wants from life, and many consider her to be blessed. But what Destiny desires most is to be able to spend her life with the man she loves. If only she had been allowed to marry him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thanksgiving Day in 1941, the Moretti and Rossi families gather to share a splendid holiday feast. Snow dances outside, but inside, even the crackling fire cannot banish the chill from Destinys peace of mind. Terrible things are just out of sight; she just knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destiny promises herself that she will not allow her growing anxiety to consume her joy on this festive night. Out of love and respect for her parents, she vows to make a sincere effort to be happy. But in the pit of her stomach, fear of the darkest magnitude has settled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has also recently learned the reasons behind her fathers lifelong despair. If she can find the strength to perform one simple but gigantic deed, she will have the power to resolve his problem. Destiny must now make some big decisions. Will she find the strength to change her own fate? Can she do the unthinkable and leave her wealthy husband? And what will happen if she gambles with her own heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
