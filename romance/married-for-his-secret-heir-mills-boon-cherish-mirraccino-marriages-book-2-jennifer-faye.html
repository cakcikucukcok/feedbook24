          &lt;strong&gt;From secret heir to secret vows…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elena Ricci has always had a crush on Earl Luca DiSalvo—with his dark and stormy eyes, his protective nature and his royal bearing, who wouldn&#39;t? But she believed they were destined to only ever be friends, until one magical evening in Paris…that has dramatic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luca is reluctant to marry…but a baby changes everything. So when beautiful Elena reveals her secret, his royal duty means he has no choice—he must make her his wife!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;Mirraccino Marriages&lt;/strong&gt;
