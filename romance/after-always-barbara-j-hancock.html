  <title>After Always - Barbara J. Hancock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lydia&#39;s life felt like it ended when Tristan died. Sure, they had their problems and he could be a little...intense at times. But he&#39;d promised to love her forever... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her parents propose a summer across the country with a music teacher who runs an inn, Lydia agrees. But it&#39;s different from what she expected. There&#39;s a presence there she can&#39;t quite reconcile--and it feels like it&#39;s hunting her. It seems Tristan&#39;s promise followed her...and may have graver consequences than she could have known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s Michael Malone, the one light spot in an otherwise dark existence. Lydia can&#39;t help but be drawn to him, and as they try to uncover the evil plaguing the inn, they grow closer. But guilt over Tristan&#39;s death still consumes her. Can she and Michael uncover what evil lurks in the inn before it takes another victim?&lt;/p&gt;" />
