      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The hardest person to serve and protect is herself&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She didn’t ask for a new deputy. Well, technically, she did ask. But Lily Tate didn’t expect city cop Vaughn Fulton to come swaggering into her sheriff&#39;s office, making her feel things she has no right to feel. Not since she lost what she loved most in a tragedy she should have seen coming. Lily can see exactly where she and Vaughn are headed. As hard as he is to resist—and as much as he seems to want her—Vaughn plans to ditch the small-town life when his stint at the Sheriff’s Department is over. Lily’s already handled enough heartbreak. What kind of fool would make the same mistake twice?&lt;/p&gt;
