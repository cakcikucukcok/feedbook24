      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More than anything in the world, Molly Eden wants a child&amp;#8212;and then one day she finds one in her backyard! But this is no abandoned toddler. A man has followed the mischievous boy onto her property, a concerned father whose rugged good looks take Molly&#39;s breath away, while the sadness about him tears at her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph Rossi never expected to find his tiny son running into the arms of an unknown woman, but Joey craves a mommy and it seems he&#39;s chosen one&amp;#8212;and Joseph approves of his choice. What chance could a single father possibly have with an enchanting free spirit as sweet and sexy as Molly Eden, who must have a hundred men clamoring for her attention? Still, he knows in his heart what Joey knows: that Molly is the one. Now he must prove it to her and show Molly a man who is more than just a daddy&amp;#8212;but also a tender and passionate lover...and, perhaps, the perfect husband.&lt;/p&gt;" />
