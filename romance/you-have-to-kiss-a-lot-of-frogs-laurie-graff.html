  <title>You Have To Kiss a Lot of Frogs - Laurie Graff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;“A provocative and intelligent look at the ways that people search for a meaningful life.”—&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forty-five-year-old actress Karrie Kline doesn’t usually lose a lot of sleep over her age or her single status. But after one too many bridal showers, a notice on her apartment, an expired unemployment claim and her acting prospects drying up—too old to play the ingénue, too young for the role of matriarch—she’s awake at 2 am and determined to get perspective on her life. Starting with the men she’s dated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the man whose parents loved her more than he did, to the famous actor who had more bark than bite, Karrie traces back through her love life to uncover how her experiences have shaped her and how to find meaning in the past. Told with warmth, wit and poignancy, You Have to Kiss a Lot of Frogs shows how to face your memories—even the darkest, most secret ones—with courage, humor and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“More than just a catalogue of loser guys and bad relationships, Graff’s smart and funny novel shows just how hard finding the right man can be and how easy it is for a relationship to fail.” —&lt;em&gt;Booklist &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“We’re rooting for her to find everything she’s been missing—which turns out to be less than she imagines.”—&lt;em&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
