  <title>Big Girls Don’t Die - Crystal Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Andre St. James is a vampire--a very old vampire--and he&#39;s used to getting what he wants. When he meets Cynthiana, a plus-size model who is used to taking care of herself, he knows she&#39;s the one for him. But she&#39;s human. And humans are weak and fragile and die from just about anything and everything. He can&#39;t lose his one true love now that he&#39;s finally found her. So he turns her. Without asking her first. He thinks he&#39;s given her a gift. She can&#39;t be mad at him for giving her the gift of eternal life. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cynthiana has always made it on her own. But thanks to the world&#39;s most annoying, sexy vampire, her world just got turned upside down. He claims she&#39;s the one for him, but he&#39;s ruined her career as a plus-sized model by turning her into a creature who casts no reflection and can&#39;t be photographed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andre has a lot to make up for if he&#39;s going to convince her they&#39;re destined to be together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the In the Heat of the Night series can be enjoyed in any order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1: Total Eclipse of the Heart&lt;br&gt;Book #2: Big Girls Don&#39;t Die&lt;br&gt;Book #3: It&#39;s Raining Men&lt;br&gt;Book #4: Crazy Little Thing Called Love&lt;/p&gt;" />
