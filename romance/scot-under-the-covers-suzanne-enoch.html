Still, Aden is not sure how he&#39;ll manage to find a Sassenach bride in time to save his family&#39;s inheritance. When his almost sister-in-law Miranda comes to him for assistance, he proposes a partnership: She will help him navigate London society and he&#39;ll teach her everything about wagering...and winning back her freedom. The beautiful, clever lass intrigues Aden--but is she playing her own game, or are the sparks between them real? He is accustomed to risking his pocket. But betting on Miranda&#39;s love is a game he can&#39;t afford to lose. . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
