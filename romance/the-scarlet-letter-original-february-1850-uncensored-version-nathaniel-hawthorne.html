  <title>The Scarlet Letter - Original February 1850 Uncensored Version - Nathaniel Hawthorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;caused quite a stir when it first appeared in February, 1850. The initial printing of 2,500 volumes sold out within ten days. It was one of the first mass-produced books in America and was widely read and discussed to an extent not much experienced in the young country up until that time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter &amp;ndash; Original February 1850 Uncensored Version&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the first incarnation of the book, before Hawthorne added a preface to a second edition of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;which was published a month later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story tells of Hester Prynne, condemned to wear the red letter A on her breast, as punishment for adultery &amp;ndash; and because she resists all attempts of the Boston clergy to make her reveal the name of her child&amp;rsquo;s father. Prynne&amp;rsquo;s husband, an old physician who had remained in Europe, arrives in America to see her on the pillory. Assuming the name of Roger Chillingworth, he decides to seek revenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henry James once said of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, &amp;quot;It is beautiful, admirable, extraordinary; it has in the highest degree that merit which I have spoken of as the mark of Hawthorne&amp;#39;s best things&amp;mdash;an indefinable purity and lightness of conception...One can often return to it; it supports familiarity and has the inexhaustible charm and mystery of great works of art.&amp;quot;" />
