  <title>Have Baby, Need Billionaire / The Boss&#39;s Baby Affair: Have Baby, Need Billionaire / The Boss&#39;s Baby Affair (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Maureen Child, Tessa Radley</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Have Baby, Need Billionaire&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Businessman Simon Bradley agreed to let Tula Barrons and her infant cousin – a baby she claimed was his – stay in his mansion until he had proof of the little boy’s paternity. But having Tula under his roof revealed something unexpected – her father had nearly destroyed Simon’s business. The billionaire could have his revenge by seducing Tula and taking away the child she loved… but if he did, he’d lose all he’d come to care for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; The Boss’s Baby Affair &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nanny Candace Morrison knew billionaire Nick Valentine had been deceived – but not by her. So when Candace revealed her hidden intentions for his baby daughter, she was stunned by her boss’s fierce response to the truth – and to their undeniable chemistry. She would stop at nothing to prove her shocking claims about the little Valentine heiress, but would it make them a family…or tear them apart?&lt;/p&gt;
