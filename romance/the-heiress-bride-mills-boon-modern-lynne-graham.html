  <title>The Heiress Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Lynne Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Business tycoon and infamous playboy Alexio Christoulakis wasn&#39;t the marrying kind. Then one of the most powerful and wealthy men in Greece offers Alexio his daughter&#39;s hand in marriage, and Alexio decides that maybe a wife–especially one as compelling as Ione Gakis–might not be a bad idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to anyone outside of the Gakis family, Ione was adopted and has been fostered in an abusive and neglectful environment–a desperate prisoner on her tyrannical father&#39;s luxurious island. Marriage to Alexio can mean only one thing: escape. And if that means marrying a complete stranger and fleeing to England to find her real family, then the sooner Ione can get that wedding ring on her finger, the better. But despite his compassion for Ione, Alexio won&#39;t tolerate a runaway wife. And he&#39;s going to make damn sure Ione never leaves his side–or his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
