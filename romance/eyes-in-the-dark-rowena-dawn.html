      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She looks for peace of mind. He looks for revenge. They both get what they want but with a twist.&lt;br /&gt;
Diane&amp;#39;s an artist and a city girl. She inherits her aunt&amp;#39;s ranch house and land and moves there in a journey to rediscover herself. But first, she discovers her inheritance comes with strings attached and people are willing to kill over it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Adam, former soldier and mercenary, wants to avenge his brother&amp;#39;s death. Diane is his only means to achieve his purpose. Or that&amp;#39;s what he thinks. When things get bad - and they do, Adam finds out that some people just sneak into one&amp;#39;s soul and haunt them for eternity.&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes in the Dark is the stand-alone second book in the Perfect Halves Series. Another tough guy hits the ground. If you like suspense and romance, then this is the book for you. Strong characters and suspense are waiting to fill in your afternoons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
