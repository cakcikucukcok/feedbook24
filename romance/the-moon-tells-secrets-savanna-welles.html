      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t trust nobody. Not family. Not friend. Don&#39;t let it get him like  it got my son until he is ready to meet it. And remember that blood  must pay for blood. A debt must be paid. Your boy can never forget. That  is his destiny.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raine is at her wits&#39; end. Her  eleven-year-old son Davey, whom she has raised by herself, has the power  to shift into any animal-a &quot;gift&quot; from his dead father.  Raine doesn&#39;t  know how to control this legacy nor protect him from the skinwalker bent  on killing them both. And if the skinwalker fails, she fears the  sinister fate that awaits her son.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cade, still grieving the  brutal murder of his wife, finds solace in Raine&#39;s companionship. But as  the savage details of his wife&#39;s death mirror the powers that Davey is  soon to have, Raine must fight to protect her child...in &lt;i&gt;The Moon Tells Secrets &lt;/i&gt;by Savanna Welles&lt;/p&gt;" />
