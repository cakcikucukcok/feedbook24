  <title>Baby&#39;s On The Way!: Bound by a Baby Bump / Expecting the Prince&#39;s Baby / The Pregnant Witness (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Ellie Darkins, Rebecca Winters, Lisa Childs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Baby’s on the Way!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bound by a Baby Bump by Ellie Darkins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they become guardians of their best friends&#39; orphaned baby, Ryan Garrett and Harper Ross expect disaster. They can&#39;t be more different – she&#39;s an uptight career woman; he&#39;s a laid back ladies&#39; man. But when their custody of little Oliver is threatened, will they go all the way and say ‘I do’?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expecting the Prince’s Baby by Rebecca Winters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Abby Loretto became a surrogate mother for the Mediterranean’s premier royal couple, she didn’t expect Prince Vincenzo would suddenly become widowed. Now pregnant Abby quickly becomes the focus of Vincenzo’s hope; she is his baby’s mother…will she become his wife?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pregnant Witness by Lisa Childs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An expert at catching bank robbers, FBI Special Agent Blaine Campbell isn’t sure who to trust. He&#39;s just rescued the beautiful, pregnant Maggie Jenkins from being abducted by robbers – but was it an inside job? Surely Maggie wasn&#39;t involved? The only thing she&#39;s guilty of is stealing his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
