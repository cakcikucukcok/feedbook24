  <title>Stripped Bear - Kate Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get lost in the powerful, sexy novella by Kate Baxter where one alpha shifter will do whatever it takes to claim the woman he can *bearly* resist...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caden Mitchell is the ultimate alpha. Known to most as a smoldering hot billionaire, his secret weapon- the ability to shapeshift into a strong and deadly bear- allows him to be the most ruthless enforcer of the Sortiari, a paranormal organization tasked with keeping the course of Fate on the right track. But when the ailing health of his grandmother leads him back home, the luscious curves of his childhood nemesis will be too much to resist...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leah Ridgeway never expected Caden to give her the time of day. With his abs cut from stone and powerful, strong arms, she knows there&#39;s no chance he&#39;s interested in her handful of curves. But Caden is tormented by thoughts of her beautiful body. And when evil threatens Leah&#39;s very life, Caden will stop at nothing to keep her safe...and claim her as his mate...in &lt;i&gt;Stripped Bear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
