  <title>Change of Heart - Nicole Jacquelyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They&#39;ve spent their lives pushing each other away, but what will happen when they need each other most?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Anita Martin doesn&#39;t expect much from life. Growing up on the street, bouncing from one foster home to another, she learned to rely only on herself. Even after she finally found a loving family to take her in, she was still an outsider-something Abraham, one of the family&#39;s older sons, never let her forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Abraham Evans doesn&#39;t know how Ani always manages to get under his skin, only that&#39;s she&#39;s been doing it since they were teens. She is-and always has been-undeniably gorgeous. But he&#39;s never met anyone as pissed off at the world as Ani. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  For fifteen years, Ani and Bram have agreed on exactly one thing: they can&#39;t stand each other-until one night when their anger gives way to passion. Yet even as Ani and Bram begin to secretly seek comfort in one another&#39;s arms, they remain emotionally worlds apart. When Ani&#39;s life takes a dramatic turn and she realizes she needs more than Bram can give, their fragile, no-strings relationship unravels. One way or another, Ani is determined to survive. But when Bram finally admits his true feelings, he may discover Ani has moved on without him . . ." />
