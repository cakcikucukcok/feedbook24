  <title>Beyond the Meadow - Ann Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elizabeth Scott had never wanted to write a book. She had never even
considered such a thing, but suddenly one day she found her head full of ideas
about a love so deep and profound that it could span time and unite lovers.
She felt compelled to write it down. The more she wrote the more ideas just
came to her. She would wake in the night with thoughts and conversations
that she had to write in the book. Finally it was fi nished and published.
Just a short, time-travel love story, but it had sold beyond her expectations
and now she was a famous author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flying home from a book signing one autumn day, Elizabeth found herself
sitting next to a man, who not only looked almost like the picture she had
drawn of the main character in her book, but he also had the same name.
From that moment on, her future appeared to depend on her past.
The problem was, Elizabeth had been adopted and her past was not something
she knew. The search for her past and the discoveries she made took her
and Dan down a road that brought them closer and closer together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For every adopted person who has wondered about their past, I hope you will
enjoy her search. For every one who ever hoped for that special love, but never
seem to fi nd, this story may give you hope. Any questions or comments may be
directed to the author at Lizz_Scott@hotmail.com." />
