  <title>In the Shadow of Shakespeare - Ellen Wilson, Jennifer Luitwieler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Teacher by day playwright by night, Alice Petrovka is pushed to her limits.&amp;nbsp; But something is conspiring to push her further...possibly over the edge.&amp;nbsp; The past begins to impose itself on the present as a famous Renaissance playwright demands to be heard. And seen. Alice&amp;#39;s psychologist husband&amp;nbsp; is convinced she is losing her sanity when she tells him of these strange occurrences.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Alice desperately tries to balance the toxic cocktail of the past mixing with the present, she is thrown backward in time to&amp;nbsp; Elizabethan England where she delves into a world of spies and playmakers. A world where theatre and espionage blend together in an impenetrable mix of plots and counterplots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice tries to understand the complicated romance she finds herself in and learns that history is not what she once thought it was. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Once propelled back into the present she struggles to find evidence to support the truth of what she knows and finds herself in deep peril.&amp;nbsp; Someone is guarding the past from investigation and will stop at nothing to thwart her efforts.&amp;nbsp; Including murder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
