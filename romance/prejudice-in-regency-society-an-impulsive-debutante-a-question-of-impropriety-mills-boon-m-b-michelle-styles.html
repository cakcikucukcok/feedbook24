          &lt;strong&gt;An Impulsive Debutante &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Carlotta Charlton can&#39;t wait for her first season - until her impulsive behaviour lands her right in the lap of notorious rake Tristan, Lord Thorngrafton! Convinced that she&#39;s a fortune-hunter Tristan is staggered by his inability to keep away. Several heated kisses lead to scandal and, one outrage later, they&#39;re on their way to Gretna Green. It is time for Tristan to teach Lottie her lesson - If she wants to play with fire, he&#39;ll notch up his seduction and set her ablaze!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; A Question of Impropriety &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Diana Clare has returned home from London in disgrace and she is trying to forget what drove her from the ton. Except rake and gambler Brett Farnham, Earl of Coltonby, seems intent on making Diana remember exactly what it was like to be whirled around the ballroom and seduced…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Brett has `mistress&#39; rather than `marriage&#39; in mind, and Diana is not sure her reputation can stand up to another scandal…&lt;/p&gt;
