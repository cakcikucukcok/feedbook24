          &lt;strong&gt;Blue Collar Baker&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In high school, Marissa Llewellyn had the hots for golden boy Jackson &quot;Jax&quot; Carlisles. So when he arrives at her bakery, yummier than ever, to investigate a series of break-ins, she can&#39;t help being reminded of the awkward girl she was. But that&#39;s not the reason she evades his questions….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Silver Spoon Sheriff&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jax grew up as part of the Fort Worth country club set, but as the new chief of police, that&#39;s all behind him, much to the chagrin of his family. Though he may not remember Marissa, he can&#39;t stop thinking about the woman she&#39;s become–and the secret she&#39;s obviously keeping from him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Recipe for Romance…or Disaster?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marissa is determined to help the homeless teen she caught breaking into her shop, even if that means lying to Jax. And when the sparks between her and the sexy sheriff ignite into a passionate affair, Marissa will have to choose between following the rules he upholds, and her own sense of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
