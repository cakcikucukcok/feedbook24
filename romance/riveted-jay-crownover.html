      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of the Marked Men books comes the next installment in the Saints of Denver series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone else in Dixie Carmichael&amp;#8217;s life has made falling in love look easy, and now she is ready for her own chance at some of that happily ever after. Which means she&amp;#8217;s done pining for the moody, silent former soldier who works with her at the bar that&amp;#8217;s become her home away from home. Nope. No more chasing the hot as heck thundercloud of a man and no more waiting for Mr. Right to find her; she&amp;#8217;s going hunting for him...even if she knows her heart is stuck on its stupid infatuation with Dash Churchill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Denver has always been just a pit stop for Church on his way back to rural Mississippi. It was supposed to be simple, uneventful, but nothing could have prepared him for the bubbly, bouncy redhead with doe eyes and endless curves. Now he knows it&amp;#8217;s time to get out of Denver, fast. For a man used to living in the shadows, the idea of spending his days in the sun is nothing short of terrifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Dixie and Church find themselves caught up in a homecoming overshadowed with lies and danger, Dixie realizes that while falling in love is easy, loving takes a whole lot more work&amp;#8230;especially when Mr. Right thinks he&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;wrong for you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
