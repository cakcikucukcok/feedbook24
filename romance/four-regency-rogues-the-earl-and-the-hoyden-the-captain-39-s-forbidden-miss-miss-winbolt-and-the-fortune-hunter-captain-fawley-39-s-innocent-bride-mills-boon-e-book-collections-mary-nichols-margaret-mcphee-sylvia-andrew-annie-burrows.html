  <title>Four Regency Rogues: The Earl and the Hoyden / The Captain&#39;s Forbidden Miss / Miss Winbolt and the Fortune Hunter / Captain Fawley&#39;s Innocent Bride (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Mary Nichols, Margaret McPhee, Sylvia Andrew, Annie Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;THE EARL AND THE HOYDEN by Mary Nichols&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He had called her a plain hoyden! Miss Charlotte Cartwright has never forgotten Roland Temple’s contemptuous rejection of her hand in marriage. And she’s not about to forgive either – even if Roland, the new Earl of Amerleigh, is now older, wiser and ten times as handsome!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE CAPTAIN’S FORBIDDEN MISS by Margaret McPhee&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Captain Pierre Dammartin is a man of honour, but his captive, Josephine Mallington, is the daughter of his sworn enemy…and his temptation. She is the one woman he should hate, yet her innocence brings hope to his battle-weary heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MISS WINBOLT AND THE FORTUNE HUNTER by Sylvia Andrew&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Respected spinster Miss Emily Winbolt, so cool and cynical with would-be suitors, puts her reputation at risk after tumbling into a stranger’s arms. Suddenly, bleak loneliness is replaced with a wanton, exciting sense of abandon. But Emily is an heiress, and her rescuer none other than Sir William Ashenden, a man who needs to marry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CAPTAIN FAWLEY’S INNOCENT BRIDE by Annie Burrows&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Battle-scarred Captain Robert Fawley was under no illusion that women still found him attractive. None would agree to marry him – except, perhaps, Miss Deborah Gillies, a woman so down on her luck that a convenient marriage might help improve her circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
