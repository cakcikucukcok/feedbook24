      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ATF Special Agent Eric Miller and his explosives detecting K-9, Tiger, pull over a truck, the contents of which are explosive. Literally. More shocking, the driver is the kid brother of a woman he left behind. One who still haunts his days &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his nights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They&#39;d never so much as kissed, but Tess McTavish never forgot the handsome, dangerous agent who vanished in a shroud of mystery. Now the last thing she needs is an ATF agent with his own agenda. Doesn&#39;t matter that Tess and her brother are innocent. If Eric learns the truth of their past, they&#39;ll never be free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric&#39;s drive for revenge against the man who targeted him and his colleagues in a deadly explosion still burns hot inside him. Another bomb is about to be detonated and he&#39;s sure there&#39;s a connection between that man...and Tess&#39;s family. But Eric and Tiger will do everything they can to protect the woman he&#39;s falling for from what&#39;s coming...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Federal K-9 series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Lock &#39;N&#39; Load&lt;br&gt;* Armed &#39;N&#39; Ready&lt;br&gt;* Dark &#39;N&#39; Deadly&lt;br&gt;* Trap &#39;N&#39; Trace&lt;/p&gt;" />
