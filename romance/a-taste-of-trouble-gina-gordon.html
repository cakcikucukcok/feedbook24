  <title>A Taste of Trouble - Gina Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Taste of Trouble by Gina Gordon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Liv Crawford decided to pursue her dream of owning her own bakery, it was no surprise that she forgot to add &quot;maintaining a serious relationship&quot; to her business plan. Not when she believes a cupcake can fix anything, even loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Miller isn&#39;t concerned about being lonely. He&#39;s cast aside his playboy lifestyle to pursue something more meaningful, his passion for photography. So, when his boss asks him to pursue a beautiful woman and coerce her to his office for a disguised meeting--no matter what it takes--in exchange for the opportunity to turn his hobby into a career, he jumps at the chance. At first sight, Liv awakens his long-buried desire for commitment, but his secret mission could ruin his hopes of keeping her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Liv&#39;s commitment to swear off relationships to run her bakery, Jake quickly becomes her number one distraction. Yet, even her misgivings can&#39;t tame the heat as they straddle the line between love and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;" />
