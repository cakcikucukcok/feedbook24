          &lt;strong&gt;It all starts with the kid…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Life was better for Logan Cathcart before he crossed paths with nine-year-old Sean Archer. Because now he has to face the kid&#39;s mom, Nora. It&#39;s not that Logan doesn&#39;t like Nora. He does–a lot. Perhaps too much. Even though she&#39;s captivated him from the moment they met, socially he and the wealthy widow next door are leagues apart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Still, keeping his distance is next to impossible with Nora constantly on his ranch, determined to clean up the mess Sean made. With the kind of sparks that erupt whenever she and Logan are within touching distance of each other, there&#39;s a whole lot of trouble in Logan&#39;s future…the adult, let&#39;s-get-serious kind of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
