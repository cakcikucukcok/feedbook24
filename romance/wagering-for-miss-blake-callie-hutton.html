  <title>Wagering For Miss Blake - Callie Hutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mr. Giles Templeton, third son of the Earl of Wexford, is a rake of the highest order and a confirmed bachelor. Yet, marriage-minded-mamas continue to drag their daughters to his attention. He&#39;s everything a young lady of the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; could want--handsome, wealthy, charming, and kind. For Miss Suzanna Blake, though, Giles is missing the one thing her parents require in a potential son-in-law--a title. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giles has a golden touch--investments, horses, connections but when he falls...hard for Suzanna, she turns him away, despite the passion sparking between them. At wit&#39;s end, Giles wagers her that not only will she marry him but he&#39;ll make her fall in love with him. If Suzanna wins, she gains a sizable fortune for her favorite charity but she faces a loveless marriage to a titled man. Though her heart yearns for a true love-match with Giles, she has never gone against her parent&#39;s wishes. All bets are off when happiness lies in losing a wager. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Lords &amp; Ladies in Love series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Seducing the Marquess&lt;br&gt;* Marrying the Wrong Earl&lt;br&gt;* Denying the Duke&lt;br&gt;* Wagering For Miss Blake&lt;br&gt;* Captivating the Earl&lt;/p&gt;" />
