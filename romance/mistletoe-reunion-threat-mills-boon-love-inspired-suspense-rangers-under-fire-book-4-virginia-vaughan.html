      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;MISSING CHILD&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Someone wants Mississippi prosecutor Ashlynn Morris dead…and they’ve taken her son to get to her. The only person she can trust to get him back is his father, a man who doesn’t even know about their secret child. When grief and survivor guilt pushed Army Ranger Garrett Lewis to run out on their wedding five years ago, he knew he was leaving behind the love of his life. But a son? Finding out he&#39;s a father has him reeling, especially since his little boy is missing. But now the tormented ex-soldier has a new mission, one that can&#39;t fail. Protect the woman he&#39;s never stopped loving…and bring her son—their son—home for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
