  <title>Substitute Gangbang - R. Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Jim and Alice get good job offers from West coast firms. They then find that Jim&amp;rsquo;s job, is dependent on Alice working as a nude, gangbang waitress. Jim and Alice don&amp;rsquo;t have enough money to run. So they have to live through Alice&amp;rsquo;s nude adventures. However, Jim schemes and manages to let Alice avoid the worst of the damage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
Tim tells me, &amp;ldquo;The company is in some difficulty financially. We have to have the Consolidated Unlimited contract. George set things up and the Consolidated Unlimited guys expect you and Alice. We checked and there&amp;#39;s no way that Alice works out. Thus, it&amp;#39;ll be you and Monica.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I ask, &amp;ldquo;Who is Monica?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim smirks and says, &amp;ldquo;George&amp;#39;s daughter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;m shocked and I stammer, &amp;ldquo;You know, I have to work for George.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim smirks again and says, &amp;ldquo;If you get the Consolidated Unlimited contract, you&amp;#39;ll work for Sam, although you&amp;#39;ll pretty much run your own operation. If you don&amp;#39;t get the Consolidated Unlimited contract ...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Okay, it&amp;#39;s win or walk. At least Alice doesn&amp;#39;t have to work in the nude.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Exactly what am I to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim smirks, &amp;ldquo;You and Monica go to the Saturday football game party. Monica works as a waitress while you guys watch the game. You watch the football game, along with the Consolidated Unlimited guys. You do watch football?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m no expert, but I know enough to cheer the good moves and be one of the guys.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim says, &amp;ldquo;So far, so good. Monica serves drinks and snacks in the nude.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you sure that Monica is okay with that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim says, &amp;ldquo;No nude Monica, no job for George.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, that&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that George told me when it was Alice who was gonna have to work in the nude.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim says, &amp;ldquo;Nude is just the start. There will be touchy-feely, Monica will suck cock and then there will be a gangbang. If it&amp;#39;s your turn to get your cock sucked, just relax and enjoy it. The whole event ends with a gangbang. When it&amp;#39;s your turn, you fuck for the company. Got that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got that. (I&amp;#39;m gonna have trouble with Alice, but at least it&amp;#39;s not Alice who&amp;#39;s gonna be the star of the gangbang.)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;#39;s the party and can I get there by bus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim hands me a slip of paper and says, &amp;ldquo;This is the address and directions. My secretary will set you up with a company car, as I understand your car isn&amp;#39;t working.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My car is totaled, in the wreck that injured Alice. My insurance company is working, unfortunately very slowly, on getting me another car. Right now, I have to take the bus everywhere.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim says, &amp;ldquo;You pick up a company car and drive by the address tonight and figure out how to get there. Saturday morning, you pick up Monica here and then drive to the address.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Will do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pick up a company car and drive by the address and then by the hospital. I finally get to see Alice and she looks terrible. I ask how she feels and she says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m okay, but don&amp;#39;t look at my face.&amp;rdquo; I tell my wife, &amp;ldquo;I talked with the nurse and she says that you&amp;#39;ll recover completely, it&amp;#39;s just severe bruising. I have to go, because they only allowed me 60 seconds and then you get a sleepy shot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alice says, &amp;ldquo;I love you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I love you and get well soon.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;#39;m then shown out by the nurse." />
