      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meet the Kincade brothers: they&amp;#8217;ll go to any lengths to protect their legacy&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;but what happens when love gets in the way...?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if the holidays weren&amp;#8217;t stressful enough, Parker Kincade has a restaurant to open. The fact that his Groomzilla brother wants the place for his perfect Christmas wedding doesn&amp;#8217;t help. Then there&amp;#8217;s the stunning woman who appoints herself his new chef before he&amp;#8217;s ready to hire one. But one look at Gabriella Montani has Parker reassessing needs vs. wants. And that&amp;#8217;s before he tastes what she has to offer&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriella doesn&amp;#8217;t need to get tangled up with a sexy man. What she needs is a job and a chance to prove herself. A place in Parker&amp;#8217;s kitchen could give her the opportunity she&amp;#8217;s been waiting for. The heat between them is sizzling, but a place in his bed could be downright dangerous. Neither Christmas nor men have ever lived up to her expectations, but Parker has soulmate written all over him. Should Gabi let herself be swept up in his holiday magic, or will it disappear before Christmas Day?&lt;/p&gt;" />
