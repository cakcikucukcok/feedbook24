          &lt;strong&gt;Do you know Keysha Kendall? Enter the world of the Keysha and Friends series – for the first time, the two original stories in this compelling series are collected into one special volume.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;KEYSHA&#39;S DRAMA &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sixteen-year-old Keysha Kendall is a judge’s signature away from foster care when she’s sent to live with the father she never knew. Suddenly she has her own room in his big fancy house, a high-powered stepmother and a popular half-brother who can introduce her to all the right people at her new school.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Keysha can’t forget where she came from and she won’t let anyone else, either. Why should her father and his perfect family have it so easy when she and her mother had it so hard? So Keysha hooks up with a rough crowd and does whatever she wants…until what she wants changes really fast…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; IF I WERE YOUR BOYFRIEND&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How has Keysha gone from popular to social outcast? A girl she thought was her friend planted drugs on her, and Keysha got caught. Now all of the negative attention has turned everyone against her. At school, Keysha is stared at and whispered about, no one will talk to her, and the girl who ruined Keysha’s reputation just laughs in her face. So when a guy with his own bad rep offers to help, Keysha has doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However she soon realizes that Wesley Morris is more than just a hot guy, he is someone who has turned his own life around. Still her family doesn’t want him anywhere near Keysha. But Wesley isn’t willing to walk away. He’ll even risk everything to prove Keysha’s innocence…and save their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
