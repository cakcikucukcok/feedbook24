  <title>Seducing the Princess (Entangled Brazen) - Diane Alberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He&#39;ll give her exactly what she needs...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protecting a princess is not what former marine Gordon Waybrook signed up for when he joined the Shillings Agency. But instead of the spoiled, regal little creature he expects, Isabelle VanGuard is a fiery, sexy-as-hell woman who&#39;s been denied what she needs for too long. And he&#39;s just the man to break through her frozen public facade and give it to her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she&#39;s with Gordon, all Isabelle can think about is pleasure. Their blistering chemistry is immediate and intense, but volatile. In fact, the only thing they agree on is that their one night together is just that--one night. Even after it becomes more. But tempers and temptation can&#39;t disguise reality. Isabelle is a princess, and a hot, hard, tattooed bodyguard isn&#39;t the Prince Charming her country expects...even if he&#39;s exactly what she needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Shillings Agency series is a stand-alone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Temporarily Yours&lt;br&gt; Book #2 Stealing His Heart&lt;br&gt; Book #3 Seducing the Princess&lt;br&gt; Book #4 Taking What&#39;s His&lt;br&gt; Book #5 Say You&#39;re Mine&lt;br&gt; Book #6 His Best Mistake&lt;/p&gt;" />
