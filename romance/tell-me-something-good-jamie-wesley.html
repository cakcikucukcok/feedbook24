  <title>Tell Me Something Good - Jamie Wesley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not that Tate Grayson is impulsive, it&#39;s just that he thinks life is too short to take seriously. That&#39;s why he sold his multimillion-dollar company and spun his fanaticism for sports into a radio talk show. Tate also knows that love is fleeting as well--a fact he never resists rubbing into the face of the relationship advice radio host and total stick in the mud, Noelle Butler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the death of her parents, a tragedy she blamed on herself, Noelle vowed to live a controlled, focused life. Now a psychologist, she channels her need for connection into her radio show. But when the arrogant sportscaster next door tells listeners men shouldn&#39;t get married, she&#39;s all too happy to yank the silver spoon out of his over-privileged mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their heated on-air arguments are a hit, but when the station director forces them to do a joint show for two weeks, Tate and Noelle object. They can&#39;t stand each other, despite the attraction sizzling beneath every interaction. But if they can&#39;t pull the struggling radio station back from the brink, they&#39;ll lose their jobs. Or worse, their hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the One on One series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Tell Me Something Good&lt;br&gt;* Slamdunked by Love&lt;br&gt;* The Deal with Love&lt;/p&gt;" />
