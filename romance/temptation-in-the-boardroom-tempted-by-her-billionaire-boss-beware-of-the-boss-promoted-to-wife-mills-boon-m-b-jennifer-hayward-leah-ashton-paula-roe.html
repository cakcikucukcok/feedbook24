  <title>Temptation In The Boardroom: Tempted by Her Billionaire Boss / Beware of the Boss / Promoted to Wife? (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Jennifer Hayward, Leah Ashton, Paula Roe</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tempted by Her Billionaire Boss&lt;/em&gt; by Jennifer Hayward&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Renowned tycoon Harrison Grant is furious. He can’t afford any distractions with a high-stakes deal on the table and his new assistant, Francesca Masseria, is as diverting for her beauty as her incompetence! He should fire her, but Harrison’s beginning to want a lot more from Francesca than just her job description!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beware of the Boss&lt;/em&gt; by Leah Ashton &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lanie Smith’s boss might look heavenly in a suit, but she’s being run ragged by Grayson Manning’s outrageous demands! But one completely unexpected – and completely magical – kiss later, Lanie’s finally forced to admit the truth – that their super-charged battle of wills hides a much more dangerous attraction…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promoted to Wife&lt;/em&gt; by Paula Roe &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Running a multi-billion dollar company meant long hours for Zac Prescott. Thankfully, his super-efficient assistant made the workload almost bearable. Theirs was a strictly professional relationship until the night Emily Reynolds finally let her hair down. And the tycoon took full advantage by stealing a kiss&lt;/p&gt;
