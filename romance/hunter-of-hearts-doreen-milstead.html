Under Primitive Conditions - Alone, a woman travels across the prairies to meet her cowboy fiancé in Nevada, but is unable to find him at first in the primitive tent town where he works. They get together and he and a drunken man who was on the floor of his shop travel to the man&#39;s brother first to drop him off, then to the tiny cabin where they are to live. She&#39;s a self-sufficient woman though and after they get married, tries to make a go of it until some bad news makes her wonder if they will survive the winter." />
