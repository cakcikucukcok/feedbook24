  <title>Duke Most Wanted - Celeste Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sophie Blake&#39;s grandfather willed his fortune to the first of his granddaughters to marry a duke.  Since her cousin, Deirdre, will seal the deal any day now, the quiet, bookish Sophie can sit back and enjoy her time with the only man she truly adores: Graham. No matter that the part charmer, part scoundrel has absolutely no designs on her! Sophie is content to engage Graham in lively conversation, beat him at cards. . .and probe at the darkness hiding behind his rakish smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Graham unexpectedly gains a title, an estate in near ruins and a mountain of debt.  If there is any chance of survival he must find a rich wife--quickly. As his hunt for a bride begins, Sophie realizes that she isn&#39;t even in the running. Suddenly no longer content to be a wallflower, Sophie gets a stunning make-over and becomes the belle of the ball. Lots of heads are turning...including Graham&#39;s. But this beauty has secrets of her own. Will she be his salvation or seal his fate?&lt;/p&gt;" />
