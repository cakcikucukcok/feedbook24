          &lt;strong&gt;Rafael’s Suitable Bride&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rafael needs a suitable wife…and Cristina is an ideal candidate: her plain-Jane looks mean she won’t stray – and she’s a virgin! Cristina is devastated to learn that Rafael’s proposal was one of convenience. But whilst their marriage isn’t based on love, Rafael intends for it to be authentic in every other respect…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Spaniard’s Marriage Bargain &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rowan had been Isandro’s bride of convenience. Knowing he would never love her as she loved him, her choice was to make her unborn child her priority… But in Isandro’s eyes Rowan had done the unforgiveable. However, he couldn’t stop her seeing her son – or deny that the passion between them was as intense as ever…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Cordero’s Forced Bride&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alexa Montague’s had to call off her sister’s wedding and now the groom, Santos, is demanding she take her sister’s place! The Montagues have stolen everything – so Santos will have Alexa instead. Santos does not – cannot – love. But his body burns for Alexa. He’ll keep her captive in his bed until she’s begging to be his…&lt;/p&gt;
