  <title>Yellow Roses, Precious Songs - Regina Bianco Cosenza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Long Island and New York City during the prosperous 1970s, life was good. 
It was a time of plentyplenty of jobs, plenty of money, plenty of hope for all, and everything seemed right with the world. For Anna Maria Bellone, a vibrant college graduate from Long Island, it was also a time to begin her career with a prominent NYC insurance firm. 
It was not long before she met the captivating Andrew Moore, who quickly swept her into his life and his soul. They enjoyed everything their beautiful city had to offerbut the secrets he held close and the events of one fateful evening shook their relationship almost beyond repair. Was it possible that all they had shared and built together could be so easily destroyed in a matter of moments? Could romance end so swiftly, leaving only broken lives and bittersweet memories behind? 
Anna relied on her strength and the love that was born below the shadows of the Manhattan skyline. She prayed that her faith would help Andrew heal emotionally while she physically recovered from the night that forever changed them. 
But Andrew had a different idea. To save her further misery, he was convinced that if he put half a country between them, his plan would be successful. Could their love overcome the circumstances that tried to separate them? Was it possible for a love founded in the shadows to blossom in the sunshine of happily ever after?" />
