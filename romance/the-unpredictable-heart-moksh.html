  <title>The Unpredictable Heart - MoKSh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;The Unpredictable Heart - You may be a Victim&quot;, is the story of a boy named Mrinav who comes from a middle-class background. Mrinav is an introvert, down to earth and a caring boy, who loves to keep everyone happy all the time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One day, Mrinav encounters a question from his best friend, which drags him into a flashback, reminding him of his past infatuations and love. He had a series of infatuations within a short span of 7 years.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This novel is a description of how these infatuations developed into love. Love (Infatuation) at first sight, Infatuation converting into one-sided love, and then finally to departure. He was heartbroken often trying to persuade his lady loves. In his memories, Mrinav cherished the beautiful and memorable days he had of experiencing young love.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The novel plays between fantasy and reality describing how events like Valentine&#39;s Day, Birthdays and more, get converted into memorable days.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And as his time flies by, his life goes through all the usual metamorphoses. While his love-seeking heart refuses to take rest. Mrinav goes through a mixture of love, infatuations and illusive emotions. His craziness with his cab-mates while traveling to his office adds spice at different parts of the novel.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Apart from Mrinav, there are a few other characters in the story as well adding the comic relief. The group included Jatin, Suzi, Omi, Shoeb, Sanjay and Sameer. They all knew that Mrinav was sentimental, who would give party at any point of time, and that too without any reason. Jatin is keen at every instant, trying to persuade Mrinav for unusual parties almost every weekend. He, being his best friend, also takes every care that there is no one to point a finger at Mrinav.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mrinav&#39;s greatest undoing is his introvert nature that at one point of the novel leaves him stranded all alone. At various instances in the novel, you would feel Mrinav missing his last train in life, while flirting with girls, cracking poems and indulging in unnecessary activities.&lt;/P&gt;" />
