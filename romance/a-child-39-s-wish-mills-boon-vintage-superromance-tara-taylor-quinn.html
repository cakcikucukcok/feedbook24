      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since her mother left them, nine-year-old Kelsey Shepherd has been raised by her dad, Mark, who&#39;s also the principal at her school. Kelsey loves her dad, and she misses her mom–but she&#39;s uncomfortable about the secret her mother wants her to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meredith Foster, Kelsey&#39;s teacher from last year, seems to know there&#39;s something wrong. She seems to feel it. Meredith comes over to visit sometimes, and Kelsey likes that.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe Meredith and her dad could fall in love. That would be good, even if principals and teachers aren&#39;t &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to kiss…&lt;/p&gt;
