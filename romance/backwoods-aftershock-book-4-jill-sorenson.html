  <title>Backwoods (Aftershock, Book 4) - Jill Sorenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The more you trust, the more you risk…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When plans for a wilderness retreat with her teenage daughter Brooke go awry, Abby Hammond reluctantly pairs up with Brooke&#39;s stepbrother and his dad, Nathan Strom, for the weeklong trek. The only thing Abby has in common with the bad-boy former pro athlete is that their exes cheated with each other. That…and a visceral attraction that&#39;s growing more complicated with every step through the picturesque woods.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nathan&#39;s wild-card reputation lost him his career and his family. After years of regret, he&#39;s ready to fight for what truly matters–and that includes Abby&#39;s hard-won trust. When Brooke goes missing, Nathan knows he&#39;s her best and only hope of rescue. But the deeper into the rugged mountains they go, the more dangerous the territory will prove–for their safety and for their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
