  <title>Daisy’S Dreams - Melissa Lemke, Mary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Daisy Hunter and Abigail Browning are two best friends who have enjoyed the everyday challenges and delights of living in rural Fairfield, New Hampshire. But in the spring of 1856, they feel as though all things familiar are crumbling beneath them. Throughout the coming year, many incidents will try their faith and threaten to hamper their joy. Together, they must continually rediscover their sustenance and hope, all the while resisting the temptation to surrender to defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interwoven within the two girls lives is a cast of characters as varied as the New England seasons. Excitement mounts for the entire town when a new minister joins the close-knit community, while intrigue is piqued when a mysterious, colorful woman appears, carrying untold secrets from the past. With autumn comes the abundance of the apple harvest, while winters burden bears heavy on many. Will Abbys and Daisys faith be strengthened, or will it simply crumble amidst the challenges? Will they finally be able to declare with certainty that they have delighted in the Lord and obtained their hearts desires?&lt;/p&gt;" />
