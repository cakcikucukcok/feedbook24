          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;You&#39;re the one.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shy, scholarly Dr. Phoebe Jones blushed when sexy private investigator Kevin Cartwright uttered those words. But when the handsome ex-cop explained she was one of four lost siblings he&#39;d been hired to find, she nearly fainted headfirst into his strong, sculpted arms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet someone else was also after the beautiful doctor and her heirloom necklace–the key to her mysterious past. Suddenly she and Kevin were posing as lovers as they raced to the ocean to uncover the truth. But Phoebe&#39;s passionate response to &quot;make-believe&quot; kisses was anything but pretend…nor was her desire to hear the sworn bachelor say the most magical words of all….&lt;/p&gt;
