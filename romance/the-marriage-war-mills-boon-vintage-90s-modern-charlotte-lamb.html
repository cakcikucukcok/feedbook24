        &lt;p&gt;Something worth fighting for! Sancha&#39;s first instinct was to burn the anonymous letter. Its malicious message couldn&#39;t be true: Do you know where your husband will be tonight? Do you know who he&#39;ll be with? Sancha adored Mark now as much as when they were first married, even though family life meant that they were no longer so close.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d never dreamed that her tough, handsome husband would fall into the arms of another woman! The battle was on - though when Sancha confronted Mark, she discovered that the physical attraction between them was as strong as ever. But she wouldn&#39;t let herself be seduced by him… . Not yet!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;em&gt;When passion knows no reason… . FORBIDDEN!&lt;/em&gt;
