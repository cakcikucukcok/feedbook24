      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Four sizzlingly sexy romances from Mills &amp; Boon&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Greek Claims His Shock Heir&lt;/em&gt; by Lynne Graham&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Learning of tycoon Eros Nevrakis’s betrayal, personal chef Winnie Mardas walks out of his life, determined never to look back—or reveal the child she’s carrying… A year later she’s shocked when Eros arrives to legitimise his heir! Swept away to his lavish Mediterranean villa, Winnie is overwhelmed by the fire still burning between them. But can she accept her new role as his convenient wife…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Venetian One-Night Baby&lt;/em&gt; by Melanie Milburne&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A hotel booking mix-up in Venice means wedding dress designer Sabrina Midhurst must share a room with her nemesis: wealthy, brooding businessman Max Firbank. It’s infuriating – until an unexpected night of passion awakens a need Sabrina didn’t even know was possible! They’ve always battled their super-charged attraction, so when Sabrina confesses she’s pregnant, she’s stunned by Max’s demand: that she wear his ring!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spaniard&#39;s Stolen Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Maisey Yates&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To notoriously ruthless Diego Navarro, kidnapping and marrying his brother’s shy fiancée seems a perfectly sensible way to secure his inheritance! Yet when Liliana Hart willingly goes with him Diego’s reluctantly intrigued… Though the heat of their marriage bed is scorching, it’s the intensity of their connection that pushes Diego to the edge. But is it powerful enough to redeem this dark-hearted billionaire?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sicilian&#39;s Bought Cinderella&lt;/em&gt; by Michelle Smart&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Posing as commanding billionaire Dante Moncada’s fiancée at a glamorous society wedding is a far cry from Aislin O’Reilly’s modest life, but she’ll do anything to secure money for her sick nephew. Her deal with Dante is strictly business—the gorgeous Sicilian playboy is danger personified. Yet soon their mutual explosive passion rips through the terms of their arrangement, leaving them both hungry for more…&lt;/p&gt;
