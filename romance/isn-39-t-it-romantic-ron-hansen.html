  <title>Isn&#39;t It Romantic? - Ron Hansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once again, acclaimed novelist Ron Hansen demonstrates his masterful versatility as a writer, with &lt;em&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t It Romantic?,&lt;/em&gt; a screwball comedy in the tradition of filmmaker Preston Sturges. In this charming entertainment, mistaken identities, botched schemes, and hilarious misunderstandings all play a part as Parisian sophistication collides with the affability and simple pleasures of the Great Plains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touring America was Natalie&amp;#39;s idea. But she had not planned on being accompanied on a cross-country bus by her playboy fianc&amp;#233;, Pierre. Nor had they anticipated being stranded in Seldom, Nebraska, population 395.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is exactly what happens to this French couple, and they quickly find themselves being taken in by the obliging citizens of Seldom: Natalie by Mrs. Christiansen, a retired high school teacher who runs a rooming house for women, and Pierre by Owen, a gas station owner and ambitious winemaker in an unlikely part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here also, the separated couple become enchanted by the locals. Natalie is soon being wooed by Dick Tupper, a handsome and honest rancher with a rambling farmhouse and lots of wide open space. Pierre falls quickly for Iona, a beautiful, no-nonsense waitress in the local diner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon everyone is hatching plots to get what they want: Owen needs help from Pierre&amp;#39;s world-class wine business if he is ever going to sell his Nebraska vintage; Pierre wants Iona; Natalie thinks she wants Dick Tupper, but maybe it&amp;#39;s Dick who wants Iona, and Natalie who wants Pierre? The fun and surprises are many in this playful romance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
