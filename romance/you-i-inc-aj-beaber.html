  <title>You &amp; I, Inc. - Aj Beaber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As your desire is, so is your will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As your will is, so is your deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As your deed is, so is your destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Upanishads&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words printed on the back of the business card sent a chill through Leneas body, causing her to question what it is she desires most in life: a partner. But how could this be her destiny when she doesnt trust men? The answer awaits in an erotically mysterious dance studio, where a broken-hearted yet hopeful Lenea joins a group of like-minded women who are taught that any desire they have can be realized through dance lessons, an intriguing objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things start to go awry when Lenea discovers the studio is haunted by a spirit of the pastwhen the building once served as a brothel in the late 1800s. She grasps for a hold on reality as she seeks to understand the connection between the supernatural occurrences and her growing relationship with an incredibly hot, talented artist who seems to have caught the eye of more than just Lenea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the navigation through her rock-strewn journey leads to her own sexual awakening, and the truth about the one thing she believes matters most in a partnership: trust.&lt;/p&gt;" />
