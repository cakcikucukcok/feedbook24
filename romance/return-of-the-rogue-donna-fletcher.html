She is thrilled when a marriage is arranged to the son of a Scottish laird . . . until her betrothed is revealed to be Cavan Sinclare. Though the savage warrior once saved her life, Honora knows no one can tame the heart of such a brute, no matter now finely chiseled his features or how enticing his eyes . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After escaping his captors, Cavan&#39;s only concern is protecting his clan from the menacing invaders who threaten at every turn&amp;#8212;and his beautiful wife is a dangerous distraction. But in the face of fiery passion, their reluctance will fade . . . and Cavan will discover that there is no greater strength than the power of true love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
