  <title>The Reluctant Matchmaker - Shobhan Bantwal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In her thought-provoking, uplifting new novel, Shobhan Bantwal vividly blends the nuances of contemporary Indian-American culture with an unconventional romance.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At thirty-one, Meena Shenoy has a fulfilling career at a New Jersey high-tech firm. Not that it impresses  her mother and aunts, who make dire predictions about her ticking biological clock. Men are drawn to Meena&#39;s dainty looks and she dates regularly, but hasn&#39;t met someone who really intrigues her. Someone professional, ambitious, confident, caring. Someone like her new boss, Prajay Nayak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Meena&#39;s thoughts turn to romance, Prajay makes an astonishing request. He wants her to craft a personal ad that will help him find a suitable wife: a statuesque, sophisticated Indian-American woman who will complement his striking height. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite her attraction to Prajay and the complications of balancing work and her &quot;marriage consultant&quot; role, Meena can&#39;t refuse the generous fee. And as her family is thrown into turmoil by her brother&#39;s relationship with a Muslim woman, Meena comes to surprising realizations about love, tradition, and the sacrifices she will--and won&#39;t--make for the sake of both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;One of the best [novels] I&#39;ve read this year.
