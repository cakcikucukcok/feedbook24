  <title>That&#39;s My Baby! (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Vicki Lewis Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Nat Grady is finally home–older and wiser. A year and a half ago, when the woman he&#39;d loved had hinted at commitment, Nat had run far and fast. But now he knows he can&#39;t live without her. So he&#39;s back, hoping they&#39;ll be able to start again. Only, Jessica&#39;s nowhere to be found. But she did leave a little something behind….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jessica Franklin is living a nightmare. She&#39;d thought things were rough when the man she loved ran out on her, leaving her to give birth to &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; child alone. But when she realized she had a stalker on her trail, she had to run–without her baby. Now, only one man can help her–Nat Grady. But can she find Nat–before the stalker finds her?&lt;/p&gt;
