  <title>The Maccabees - Naseeba Omar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A family of three, is cooped in the shell of desperation, dying to be out of the miseries like how a chick can&#39;t wait to be out of the heat of its shell. Charlotte loses her husband at an early stage after seeing her parents get buried with her brother, nowhere to be found. The deadly rhythms keep on because most of all, her first child is the devil herself.
Kayla MacCabee, the charming devil loves machines, does anything to get loved and thinks her mother is heartless. She hates that her dearest friends (her father and her grandmother) are off board her ship, hates she&#39;s in love with her only surviving friend, Andrew Patterson who rather keeps to the memories of his dead girlfriend. But comes Ralph Carter, a wealthy young business man who pours out roses. But . . .
Ingrid MacCabee is a sweet blond, a successful play maker. Only she falls well madly in an obsession. She damns herself for the special eyes she has for a no-nice guy, an artist. She would not look at Ray Adams, a handsome, half-American half-Spanish talent who would die for her. Her scalding attraction- the guy in person, Jason Sands, the beastliest Casanova in her college. Then jumps in is Maureen de Crapeau, another malicious character, an awesome play maker who would do anything to put Ingrid in the darkest dark.
Out of the family&#39;s mansion comes their friends. But they are unfortunately no better than the MacCabees." />
