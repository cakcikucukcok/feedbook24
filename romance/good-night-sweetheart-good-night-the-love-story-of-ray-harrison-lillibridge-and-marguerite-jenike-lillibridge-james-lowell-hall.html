  <title>Good Night, Sweetheart, Good Night: The Love Story of Ray Harrison Lillibridge and Marguerite Jenike Lillibridge - James Lowell Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While growing up in South Dakota, Ray Lillibridge saw Sioux Indian chief Sitting Bull, witnessed the Children&#39;s Blizzard of 1888, and lived through prairie fires, grasshopper infestations, and times of want. But when he moved to Delavan, Illinois, in the early 1900s to live with his uncle, he had no idea that destiny was already guiding him to the love of his life. In a compilation of letters, recollections, and photographs, James Lowell Hall leads others through the love story of Ray Lillibridge and Marguerite Jenike as they courted each other, fell in love, corresponded, and bridged the ten-mile gap between their homes. The book gives a glimpse of life and hardships in America over one hundred years ago, recounting Ray&#39;s internal struggles, Marguerite&#39;s devotion to her faith and family, and the legacy they left behind. Good Night, Sweetheart, Good Night shares the true love story of a young couple at the turn of the twentieth century as they created a life together." />
