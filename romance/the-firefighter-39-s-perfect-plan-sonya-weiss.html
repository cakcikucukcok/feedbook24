      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Josie Moore is in &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; trouble. After a few too many glasses of wine and tired of her mother&#39;s constant disappointment, Josie tells what she thinks is a harmless lie--that she is sort of in a relationship with her childhood crush, firefighter Lincoln Bradford. The lie comes back to bite her when her mother moves back to town, and now Josie has to make the fantasy a reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lincoln has a perfect plan to protect his heart--and rule number one is: don&#39;t fall in love. There&#39;s no such thing as happily ever after, especially when it comes to love. But he didn&#39;t factor in Josie, his sister&#39;s quirky, gorgeous best friend. He agrees to help her, with the understanding that they&#39;re definitely not going to be anything more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But every time they try to break up, they only end up tangled deeper together. Lincoln&#39;s carefully laid plans are about to come crashing down...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Fire and Sparks series is STANDALONE.&lt;br&gt;* Wedding Date Rescue&lt;br&gt;* The Firefighter&#39;s Perfect Plan&lt;/p&gt;" />
