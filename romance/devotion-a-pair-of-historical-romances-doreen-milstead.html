  <title>Devotion: A Pair of Historical Romances - Doreen Milstead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sent By God To The California Cowboy, is about a young woman in New York City who has fallen onto hard times after being released from the orphanage she&#39;d been in for a majority of her life. Two kind women take her into a halfway house but there is reason for her to leave New York immediately. The only way the women feel they can keep her safe is to ship her off to California where their nephew, they tell her, needs a good housekeeper and cook for his ranch.   The Joyful Wife, The Drunken Cowboy &amp; His Bitter Sister - A woman travels west to join her fiancé, a cowboy with a cranky sister who appears to be permanently bitter. The woman and her cowboy are married immediately and they return to the ranch where she has to contend with his drunken ways and the sister who simply won&#39;t go away. A cattle drive gives her time to think as well as to wonder who on earth it is arriving back at the ranch with his men, because it certainly doesn&#39;t look like her husband in any way." />
