          &lt;strong&gt; Mills &amp; Boon are excited to present The Anne Mather Collection – the complete works by this classic author made available to download for the very first time! These books span six decades of a phenomenal writing career, and every story is available to read unedited and untouched from their original release. &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;A dangerous deception…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alix has good reasons for wanting to work for the powerful Oliver Morgan - but she knew he won’t like them! So she takes the job he offers under false pretences, hoping he will never discover the truth…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Alix is about to find out that that she has been deceived too when it turns out the position doesn’t exist! Alix is soon caught up in a dangerous double-game with Oliver – and the disturbing attraction between them is threatening to upset both their plans…&lt;/p&gt;
