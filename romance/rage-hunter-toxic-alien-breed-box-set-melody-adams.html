  <title>Rage, Hunter &amp; Toxic - Alien Breed Box Set - Melody Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three Alien Breed Series books in one Box Set&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RAGE:&lt;br /&gt;
While young Jessie Colby cleans for Dexter Medical Industry, she accidentally stumbles over a man in chains who claims to be a hybrid between human and alien. His aggressive behavior frightens her, but she can&amp;rsquo;t just ignore his abuse, so she takes his picture and reports his fate to the media.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ten years later, Jessie signs a contract to work as a doctor in the West-Colony on planet Eden, where the Alien Breeds live since their rescue. All those years she couldn&amp;rsquo;t forget the man in chains. But when she stands before him again, he is not happy at all to see her.&lt;br /&gt;
Years of abuse and pain lay behind Rage, but what tortures him most, is his memory of the beautiful young woman who worked for DMI. Even ten years after, she still hounds him in his sleep. Then she suddenly stands right in front of him. Finally he could make her pay for what she did to him, but when he has her at his mercy, killing her is the last thing on his mind. His beast wants her. But if he looses control of his alien side, the fragile human could end up hurt or dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HUNTER:&lt;br /&gt;
he Alien Breeds would like to govern themselves. When the daughter of the president gets kidnapped and President Jackson ask Hunter for help, he sees a chance to get the president on board for their independence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Mission is to find the daughter of the president and bring her home safely. Hunter has his name not without reason. Finding and freeing Pearl is not a difficulty, but to keep his hands of the beautiful woman is a much harder task. Especially since Peal tries everything to seduce him. But he can&amp;rsquo;t give in to his desire. He is to wild and the chances to hurt the human female are just too big.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pearl is glad when the tall Alien Breed comes to her rescue, but she is not in a hurry to get back to her controlling father. Hunter is the kind of man she could fall for. Only the damn man stubbornly resists her. But Pearl is used to get what she wants, and the sexy Alien Breed is exactly what she wants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TOXIC:&lt;br /&gt;
When Alina&amp;rsquo;s father brings home a serious injured Alien Breed, she is the only one who believes in his chance to survive. The miracle happens and the young Alien Breed recovers quickly. Soon he will be able to join the other Breeds on Eden. But Alina has fallen in love with Toxic and the thought of loosing him is just too much. She manages to get on board of the shuttle unseen and hides in a service whole. But then something goes wrong and the shuttle crashes on an unknown planet. Toxic and Alina are the only survivors, but they are light-years from home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Toxic doesn&amp;rsquo;t know much about life in freedom, but he knows that he has to protect the human girl from the monsters on the unknown planet, they crashed onto. Growing up isolated, he has no idea what to make off his strange feelings for the female, but one thing he knows: Alina is HIS" />
