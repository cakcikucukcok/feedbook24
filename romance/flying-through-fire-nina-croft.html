  <title>Flying Through Fire - Nina Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winged monsters have been seen in the skies, and a pestilence follows in their wake, threatening the very survival of mankind. Only the crew of the &lt;i&gt;Blood Hunter&lt;/i&gt; knows where they come from, and only one man has the power to send them back--Thorne, a human/dragon hybrid in possession of mental powers beyond comprehension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Decker doesn&#39;t need anyone to look after her--she&#39;s a badass werewolf more than capable of protecting herself and those she loves. All the same, she&#39;s always been drawn to Thorne&#39;s strength. In an uncertain world, he&#39;s the one man who makes her feel safe. And what Candy wants, she usually gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Candy is tenacious, Thorne&#39;s willpower has been honed over ten thousand years. He might want her, but the last thing he needs is an infatuation with a young, impetuous werewolf. Candy makes him lose control, and that could have disastrous consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the threat escalates and they become separated by time and space, Candy must find a way back to him, because while Thorne alone has the power to defeat the dragons, only together can they finally bring peace to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Dark Desires series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Break Out&lt;br&gt;* Deadly Pursuit&lt;br&gt;* Death Defying&lt;br&gt;* Temporal Shift&lt;br&gt;* Blood and Metal&lt;br&gt;* Flying Through Fire&lt;/p&gt;" />
