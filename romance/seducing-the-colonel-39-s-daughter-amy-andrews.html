  <title>Seducing the Colonel&#39;s Daughter - Amy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign: Scorpio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sting of this Scorpio is unforgettably hot...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ivy Danforth is out from under her colonel father&#39;s overprotective control, and she&#39;s making it count. Big time. She&#39;s taken the summer off to travel through Australia with her bestie and experiencing all that life has to offer-when you&#39;re not under constant military surveillance. She wants to end her summer with some sexy fun, and she has just the hottie in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth Rodrigo is ex-Special Forces working undercover and keeping an eye on Ivy as a special favor to her father. All he has to do is not give the game away and reveal who he &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; is. And especially not give into the hunger that&#39;s burning through his careful control...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then they&#39;re forced into protective custody. Alone. Together. For four days. And this time, the colonel&#39;s daughter isn&#39;t taking no for an answer...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Men of the Zodiac series is STANDALONE: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impulse Control&lt;br&gt;The Millionaire&#39;s Deception&lt;br&gt;The Millionaire&#39;s Forever&lt;br&gt;Ten Days in Tuscany&lt;br&gt;The Millionaire Daddy Project&lt;br&gt;Revenge Best Served Hot&lt;br&gt;The Prince&#39;s Runaway Lover&lt;br&gt;Seducing the Colonel&#39;s Daughter&lt;br&gt;One Night with the Billionaire&lt;br&gt;The Greek Tycoon&#39;s Tarnished Bride&lt;br&gt;Blurring the Lines&lt;br&gt;Her Sworn Enemy&lt;/p&gt;" />
