  <title>Cho Snog&#39;s a tha thu - Alison Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Naomi was a timid computer nerd until she created &#39;Snog&#39;, a social networking app that&#39;s taking the internet by storm. Suddenly she&#39;s running an international company and it&#39;s all a bit overwhelming. But her friend Jeni resents Naomi&#39;s success and can&#39;t forgive her for stealing away her ex-boyfriend Simon. Jeni wants Simon back and she knows just how to go about it, by creating a fake profile and luring Naomi into an online flirtation with a fictitious man. As Naomi&#39;s relationship with Simon begins to wobble, Jeni offers a shoulder to cry on and plenty of sympathetic advice, although her online mischief making is becoming even more extreme and it&#39;s only a matter of time before she gets found out. Can Simon and Naomi forgive each other or has too much damage been done?" />
