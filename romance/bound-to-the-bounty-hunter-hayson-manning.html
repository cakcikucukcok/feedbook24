  <title>Bound to the Bounty Hunter - Hayson Manning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Harlan Franco, Colorado&#39;s busiest bounty hunter and security expert, lives by his own rules: be in control, be detached, and never mix business with pleasure. These rules are tested when the woman he&#39;s being paid to secretly guard is none other than the sexy, unpredictable, pain in the butt, Sophie Callaghan--a woman determined to stay away from him. If Sophie finds out he&#39;s in her life on an assignment, he&#39;ll never get the info he needs. But those lips, those curves, that attitude... If he could only have her for one night where she&#39;d play by his rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom-loving private investigator Sophie Callaghan is on a mission. The daughter of a con-artist is not going to be used by a man again. What she doesn&#39;t need is hot, broody, and controlling Harlan barging into her life. Her brain may say no, but her body craves this bad boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a night where both live out their darkest desires, Sophie tries to fight the explosive chemistry between them. But the ties that bind her heart to this bounty hunter are tight and tangled.&lt;/p&gt;" />
