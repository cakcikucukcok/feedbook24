          &lt;em&gt;He wants to turn her in—she wants to take him to bed!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The moment wealthy ranch owner Tucker Brennan sees Annie Sheridan&#39;s photo on a website, he knows he&#39;s finally found the woman who let his brother take the fall in an embezzlement scheme. Now Tucker is on his way to the Safe Haven animal shelter in Montana to find out what really happened…and bring Annie to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a struggling shelter and no cash, Annie Sheridan has her hands so full that she&#39;s almost forgotten why she had to go into hiding. So when the sleek and damnably good-lookin&#39; Tucker shows up offering a donation—and potential nooky action!— Annie figures things are finally going right.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are secrets. There are lies. And there&#39;s one heck of an attraction. But once they give themselves over to lust, no one needs to know….&lt;/p&gt;
