The solitary life of a rancher and the untamed Montana wilderness make him feel alive-and nothing will ever change that. Not even being thrown from his horse and forced to accept a stranger&#39;s help. The fact that this stranger is a beautiful blonde with a passion for ranching that rivals his own doesn&#39;t hurt. But there&#39;s a secret she&#39;s hiding, and Luke won&#39;t rest until he uncovers it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ingrid Larsen doesn&#39;t need anyone&#39;s help. Not with managing her family&#39;s ranch. Not with raising her little sister. And certainly not with the mysterious incidents occurring on her property. When this too-sexy-for-his-own-good cowboy needs a place to recover, she hopes he&#39;ll be in and out in no time flat. But just as she&#39;s beginning to trust Luke&#39;s promise of protection, Ingrid&#39;s secret threatens to tear them apart.&lt;br&gt;" />
