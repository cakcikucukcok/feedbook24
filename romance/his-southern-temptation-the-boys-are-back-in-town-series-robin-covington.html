Some women are a bad idea. The best ones are both...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Black Ops assassin, &quot;Lucky&quot; Landon has had more than his fair share of close calls. Now he&#39;s turned in his sniper rifle for the simple life of his small hometown. So the last thing he ever expected was to end up at gunpoint. Or that the woman holding the gun would be his best friend&#39;s little sister and Lucky&#39;s on-again/off-again lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor Elliott is Trouble, and she likes it that way. And seeing Lucky again? Well, he&#39;s been her dirty little secret for the past few years and everyone knows that secrets in a small town are almost impossible to keep. But Taylor has bigger problems on her plate. Like the local mob boss who wants her dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And right now the only thing standing between Trouble and disaster is a hottie named Lucky...&lt;/p&gt;" />
