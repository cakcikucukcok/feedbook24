  <title>Echoes in Death - J. D. Robb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Echoes in Death&lt;/i&gt;, the chilling new suspense novel from #1 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author J.D. Robb is the perfect entry point into the compelling In Death police procedural series featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As NY Lt. Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband Roarke are driving home, a young woman--dazed, naked, and bloody--suddenly stumbles out in front of their car. Roarke slams on the brakes and Eve springs into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daphne Strazza is rushed to the ER, but it&#39;s too late for her husband Dr. Anthony Strazza. A brilliant orthopedic surgeon, he now lies dead amid the wreckage of his obsessively organized town house, his three safes opened and emptied. Daphne would be a valuable witness, but in her terror and shock the only description of the perp she can offer is repeatedly calling him &quot;the devil&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it emerges that Dr. Strazza was cold, controlling, and widely disliked, this is one case where the evidence doesn&#39;t point to the spouse. So Eve and her team must get started on the legwork, interviewing everyone from dinner-party guests to professional colleagues to caterers, in a desperate race to answer some crucial questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the devil look like? And where will he show up next?&lt;/p&gt;" />
