  <title>Maybe This Kiss - Jennifer Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love is always worth the risk . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Neil Healy was happy to be promoted to Air Force lieutenant colonel, but he&#39;s less than thrilled that the new job has brought him back to his hometown. The memories alone could kill a man, to say nothing of actually seeing the woman he never got over. Neil knew avoiding Becky Westmore would be impossible, but he didn&#39;t expect the chemistry between them to be as strong as ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All Becky wants this holiday season is to get through the month of December with her sanity intact. Not helping? Her ex-boyfriend&#39;s return to Glenwood Falls. Even after a decade apart, Neil still makes her feel in ways no other man has. But Christmas is a time for miracles, and maybe Becky&#39;s will be a second chance at first love." />
