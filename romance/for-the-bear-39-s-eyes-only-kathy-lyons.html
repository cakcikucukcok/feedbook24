After he was captured and tortured by a mysterious enemy, the lawyer&#39;s latent grizzly-shifter DNA was triggered. The old Alan is gone, and in his place is a terrifying vicious beast that lives and breathes for revenge. He will track down the person who did this to him-and it&#39;ll be the last thing he ever does. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Tonya Kappes refuses to let Alan run headlong to his death. A bear-shifting deputy-and the Gladwin Clan&#39;s beta-Tonya faces Alan with one weapon: the love that&#39;s lingered between them since they were kids. But the idealistic man she knew has changed...into something raw, primal, and unbelievably sexy, igniting every lustful cell in her body. And, if Alan can&#39;t learn to love the beast inside himself, maybe he can love the animal in her . . ." />
