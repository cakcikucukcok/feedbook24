  <title>Temptation&#39;s Song (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) - Janice Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Elle Jones is living her dream. She&#39;s come to Italy on vacation, but when she learns legendary composer Dominic Corelli is holding open auditions for his next opera, she jumps at the chance to perform for him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not only does the driven musician cast her as the lead in his latest opus, he arouses desire like nothing Elle has ever known. Elle knows she&#39;s playing with fire, but how can she resist Dominic&#39;s haunting melody of seduction?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elle doesn&#39;t act like any diva Dominic&#39;s ever known. Music may be his mistress, but he&#39;s sinfully tempted by the voluptuous beauty with the voice of an angel. Will each of them end up singing a solo of unfulfilled yearning? Or, together, can they make the sweet, soul-stirring music that comes straight from the heart?&lt;/p&gt;
