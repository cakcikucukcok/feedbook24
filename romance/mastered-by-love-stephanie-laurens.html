  <title>Mastered By Love - Stephanie Laurens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The men of the Bastion Club proved their bravery secretly fighting for their country. Now their leader faces that most dangerous mission of all: finding a bride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the mysterious leader of the Bastion Club known as &quot;Dalziel,&quot; Royce Varisey, tenth Duke of Wolverstone, served his country for decades, facing dangers untold. But as the holder of one of England&#39;s most august noble titles, he must now take on that gravest duty of all: marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the young ladies the grand dames would have him consider are predictably boring. Far more tempting is his castle&#39;s willful and determinedly aloof chatelaine, Minerva Chesterton. Beneath her serene fa&amp;#231;ade lies a woman of smoldering sensuality, one who will fill his days with comfort and his nights with sheer pleasure. Determined to claim her, he embarks on a seduction to prove his mastery over every inch of her body . . . and every piece of her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
