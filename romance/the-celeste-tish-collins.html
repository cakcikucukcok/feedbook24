  <title>The Celeste - Tish Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young, separated and with three children between them, Chloe Vines and Abigail Webb decide theyd be better off living in the tiny, uncharted town of Witchs grove, Kentucky, than to go on living with their alcohol abusing husbands. Abigails brother (Garret) and his wife (Cora) happily invite them to stay in their home through this upsetting obstacle in their life. But when a crazy-eyed old man with his protective, pet opossum has a fear for the new-comers, they get the boot. Things were starting to look bleak for the best-friends until they found Zavier and Abraxas Celeste, who has a house for rent; two gorgeous home-owners up Falcons Climb with an incredible secret and something magical up their sleeve. This book not only captures the problems in every day domestic situations, it is also a tale of triumph! Two main sides in a world of magic are the Godly Paradragons, and the Devilish Mist Witches. Find out how the war started eons ago, and how Chloe and Abby cope wtih the whole immortal dealings. Without the broomsticks, knights and castles, The Celeste will take you back to olden days of England, the time of queen Mary Tudor, all the way to present day U.S.A. Read about Chloe and Abby&#39;s infatuation for the Celeste brothers and a major twist, that even their psychic abilities over-looked." />
