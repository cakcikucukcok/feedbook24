      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Senna Callas&#39;s one-night stand with her alpha asshole boss, Marco Medina, was supposed to mark the end of her internship and their ridiculous attraction. After being unreachable and ignoring Senna for a year, Marco sweeps back into the country and summons her to his office, revealing he knows her secret...the secret created during their explosive night together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marco is determined to be there for the son he&#39;s just discovered he has, but when it comes to being with Senna, his choices aren&#39;t his own. His meddling family expects him, the firstborn son, to follow through with the arranged marriage set up when he was a child. And Senna has no plans on being his mistress and still resents how her attempts to contact Marco were ignored. The only thing going right between them is the attraction that burns no matter the complicated situation they&#39;re in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marco would do anything to protect his family, anything except decide between the legacy he was born into and the young family he&#39;s just found...&lt;/p&gt;" />
