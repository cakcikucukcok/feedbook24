  <title>Green Glass - Pat Nelson Klud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jennys green glass pin is stolen. Even the police detective investigating the break-in wonders how it ties in with other home thefts in the area.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thief thinks he is being careful and is enjoying his newfound wealth. But is that enough?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an estate lawyers wife goes to a Bible study, her husband becomes irate. Why?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do parents deal with runaway teens, and how long must they wait to see their prayers answered?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to solve the mystery surrounding the break-ins. Find that a chance meeting might lead to something more and how answers to prayer come in unexpected ways. See how one person can influence several individuals. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love it! I hear the mamas heart in Kathleen, and the joy in Jennys discovery of independence. I so see the thread of grace running all through it  the story of the Lords desire to see His kids, meet them where they are, and be joined with them. A great book!&lt;p&gt;
