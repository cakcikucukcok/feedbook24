        &lt;h2&gt;Susan Stephens Selection…&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The French Count’s Mistress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kate Foster decides to open a business at her family&#39;s cottage on the estate of a French chateau, she discovers that all the other properties on the estate have been sold to the millionaire Count Guy de Villeneuve.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Guy is determined to prevent Kate from setting up her business on his land – until he realizes the intense physical chemistry that burns between them is impossible to resist. He will have his land and Kate as his mistress – whatever it takes!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spaniard&#39;s Revenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ford family caused Xavier Bordiu&#39;s brother&#39;s death. Now Sophie Ford works for him! Tempted by her beauty, Xavier will take his revenge in the most pleasurable way…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sophie is still a virgin. But, as Xavier&#39;s skillful seduction awakens Sophie&#39;s sensuality, he finds the ice around his own heart beginning to melt. This is not the kind of revenge on which the Spaniard has bargained!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virgin For Sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constantine Zagorakis has left poverty behind to become a billionaire known for his ruthless tactics….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lisa Bond has defied her past, too; now she&#39;s independent and successful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their deal: One week on Constantine&#39;s private island to talk business–and he&#39;ll show her the pleasure of being with a real man…. But when theweek is over, and their working deal sealed, both may pay a price on which they hadn&#39;t bargained….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bedded by the Desert King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zara Kingston has gone to the desert city of Zaddara to confront the man she blames for her troubled past. But when, during a sandstorm, she&#39;s protected by a dark stranger, she finds that the desert holds hidden treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Zara soon realizes that the man she yearns for is Sheikh Shahin–the thief of her happiness! Shahin knows that Zara is a virgin–forbidden, no matter how strong his desire. But it&#39;s forbidden fruit that tastes the sweetest…&lt;/p&gt;
