  <title>The Good, the Bad, and the Duke - Janna MacGregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Books of November -&lt;i&gt; Bookriot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A lady with a noble mission. A duke looking for redemption. A forbidden love that cannot be denied, in The Good, The Bad, and The Duke by Janna MacGregor.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Daphne Hallworth is ready to celebrate the holidays with her family. But when they accidentally leave her home alone, Daphne uses the time to work on her dream--opening a home for unwed mothers. But her quest isn&#39;t problem-free: She&#39;s in a battle to win the property for the home against her brother&#39;s best friend-turned-enemy, Paul Barstowe, Duke of Southart. And that&#39;s not all: someone has stolen her personal diary, which holds secrets that could devastate her family. Daphne has always harbored private feelings for the man her family scorns...though perhaps striking a bargain with the handsome Duke will solve both their problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul, long considered good for nothing, aims to open a hospital to honor his brother and restore his reputation. So when a conflict over the land brings him straight into Daphne&#39;s life, they make a deal: He will help her find her diary if Daphne can change her family&#39;s opinion of him. But before he can win her family&#39;s affection, he has to win hers first. Maybe love was the answer to their family feud all along?&lt;/p&gt;" />
