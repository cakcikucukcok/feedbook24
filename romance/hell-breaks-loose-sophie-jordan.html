  <title>Hell Breaks Loose - Sophie Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hell hath no hunger like a man let out of a cage . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy and awkward, First Daughter Grace Reeves has always done what she&amp;#8217;s told. Tired of taking orders, she escapes her security detail for a rare moment of peace. Except her worst nightmare comes to life when a ruthless gang of criminals abducts her. Her only choice is to place her trust in Reid Allister, an escaped convict whose piercing gaze awakens something deep inside her. Reid is nothing like her other captors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s tougher, smarter&amp;#8230;and one blistering look from him makes her hotter than any man ever has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid spent years plotting escape and revenge . . .years without a woman in his bed. For this hardened felon, Grace Reeves isn&amp;#8217;t just out of his league&amp;#8212;she&amp;#8217;s from another planet, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t stop him from wanting her. Escaping Devil&amp;#8217;s Rock was tough, but resisting this woman could be the end of him. For a man with nothing to lose, protecting her . . . claiming her as his own, becomes more necessary than his next breath.&lt;/p&gt;" />
