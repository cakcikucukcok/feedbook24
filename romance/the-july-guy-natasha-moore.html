  <title>The July Guy - Natasha Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Art professor Anita Delgado spends eleven months of the year working. July is her month to cut loose, paint, and pick a guy to make the summer memorable. But this year she isn&#39;t in a tropical location with an exotic man like she&#39;d planned. She&#39;s stuck in small-town USA dealing with a lake house she doesn&#39;t want, inherited from a grandmother she never knew. A summer fling might be the only thing to get her through the next few weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Salvage specialist Noah Colburn is running for mayor. If he doesn&#39;t, an absolute idiot is going to ruin his beloved town. So he&#39;s stepping up. It&#39;s what he does--with his teenage daughters, with the family business, and now with Lakeside. But when the newest resident of the town asks him to renovate her grandmother&#39;s house--and have a four-week fling --he&#39;s tempted. Tempted to step out of the mold and take just one thing for himself. But the gossip mill in the town is notorious. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anita&#39;s learning it&#39;s hard to have a fling when the town follows your every move, and it&#39;s even harder when the July guy makes it clear one month is never going to be enough...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Men of Lakeside series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The July Guy&lt;br&gt;* The Standby Guy&lt;/p&gt;" />
