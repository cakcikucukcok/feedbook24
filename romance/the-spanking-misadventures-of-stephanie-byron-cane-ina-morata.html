  <title>The Spanking Misadventures of Stephanie - Byron Cane, Ina Morata</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pity poor Stephanie: twenty-five years old and still spanked daily. She was intelligent, a college graduate with honors, articulate, a fashionista with a good job and an all-round delightful person with never a cross word and always a genuine smile for everyone. It was to her misfortune that she also exuded an innocent sensual charm, leading both men and women to have one uppermost thought in their minds: spanking Stephanie&amp;rsquo;s spectacular and epic rounded bottom. It was not her fault; genetics had blessed her with both the ideal rear end and a delightful bewildered submissiveness. It simply never occurred to her to challenge her discipline. If someone needed to spank her, well, obviously she was guilty of some offense and thus deserved to be spanked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Stephanie crashes (quite literally) into the life of Ross, high flying exec in the fashion world and eligible bachelor, she is stupefied he wants her as his. Under Ross&amp;rsquo; tutelage, as Brat to his Sir, she learns that she can be spanked for more than just being naughty! And Ross &amp;mdash; he discovers there&amp;rsquo;s much more to Stephanie than just her submissive need to be disciplined, as he falls more and more in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brilliantly funny, light-hearted, spanking erotic romance novella by Byron Cane, with memorable characters and a beautiful love story interwoven into the sexiness, lending a contemporary twist to the princess fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;" />
