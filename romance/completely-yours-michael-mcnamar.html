  <title>Completely Yours - Michael McNamar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love and acceptance are two basic needs that all human beings share. But only by giving our lives completely to Jesus Christ, like I did nearly thirty years ago, can we have those needs fulfilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After twenty-two years of marriage, having raised two children, and being involved in education for over twenty years, its possible for me to tell Nancys story. It is a story about a human being in search of a relationship with her Creator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely Yours is about real people and real problems. It is like my first book, Crushed by Love, a story of healing and recovery from severe childhood abuse that probes the same human needslove and acceptance. It is not just a womans story, it is a human story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancys life was destroyed when her marriage to Morgan ended after fifteen years of unfaithfulness, separating Nancy from her daughter Cassie. She found hope for a new life that night when she knocked on Brians apartment door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did she find someone who would love her in spite of her past, Nancy also gave her life completely to Jesus Christ, the only true healer of the human heart. Years later, now a mother in her own right, Nancy is being reunited with Cassie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan is dying of the effects of AIDS, and Cassie needs the only mother she has ever known. Her phone call starts Nancy down memory lane that brings her life full circle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Completely Yours deals with very challenging issues in such a sensitive way that anyone who reads this book will know that God loves them, no matter what has happened in their lives in the past.&lt;br&gt;
