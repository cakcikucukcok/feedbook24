  <title>Forged by Fate - Reese Monroe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Forged by Fate (A Bound By Hades Novel) by Reese Monroe&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new adult novel from Entangled&#39;s Embrace imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;He&#39;s waited more than 900 years to love her...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being the Gatekeeper to Hades is no small feat, and waiting almost a millennia to meet your mate is damn near impossible. But Theo Bradford&#39;s mark has finally surfaced on his intended. Now all he has to do is find her and convince her to embrace her supernatural heritage.&lt;br&gt;Young genius, Sadie Nowland, has got life figured out. Graduating college at the age of eighteen and accepting a six-figure job is just what she needs to prove she&#39;s made something of herself. But when a strange tattoo mysteriously appears on her shoulder and Theo starts talking about Mates, it catapults her neatly laid out life into chaos.&lt;br&gt;Targeted by a vicious demon escaped from Hades, Sadie is thrust into the volatile world of Shomrei warriors and a connection to Theo her brain can&#39;t comprehend and her body can&#39;t deny. That primal bond proves more imperative to their survival than either could have ever imagined--and just may be the key to the world&#39;s survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
