  <title>The Duke That I Marry - Cathy Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time there were three young ladies who, despite their fortunes, had been on the marriage mart a bit too long.&amp;#160;They were known as &amp;#8220;the Spinster Heiresses&amp;#8221; . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it wrong for a woman to want more?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not if she is a Spinster Heiress. They do not settle. Any young miss would be very lucky to find herself promised to a man like the Duke of Camberly. However, Miss Willa Reverly has watched her friends marry for love. Camberly may be the prize of the season, but she will not be &amp;#8220;sold&amp;#8221; to any man. She wants his devotion or she wants nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When is a Marriage of Convenience inconvenient?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly named to the ducal title, Matthew Addison is determined to discover the secrets behind Mayfield, the bankrupt estate he has inherited. He doesn&amp;#8217;t have time to coddle a headstrong heiress who is determined to ditch him over something as silly as &amp;#8220;love.&amp;#8221; Little does he know that his questions will place her in jeopardy. Now he must do what he must to save them both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could it be that in running from danger they might be racing headlong into a truly unexpected fate: falling in love?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
