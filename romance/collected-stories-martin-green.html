  <title>Collected Stories - Martin Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stories in this volume are in three sections. &quot;Retirement Stories&quot; are about senior citizens, such as a retiree prompted by a college survey to examine his past (&quot;Mr. Maple&#39;s Good Life&quot;), a retiree prompted to think about human connections after a chance meeting with &quot;The Lady from Australia&quot; and a retiree who sees a chance for revenge when the ex-boss who fired him moves next door (&quot;New Neighbors&quot;).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Left-Over Stories&quot; are those I couldn&#39;t fit into Volume I. These include a story telling you how to make &quot;Money&quot;, worth the price of the book alone, and a trilogy continuing the story of the young man in &quot;Being in Love&quot; with &quot;Getting Married&quot; and &quot;Struggling On&quot; in the early married years.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The third section has stories written just for fun, which I hope, will be fun to read. There&#39;s a ghost story, a vampire story, a love potion story, a magic ring story and more. In the last story, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, a writer tries to outwit death.&lt;/P&gt;" />
