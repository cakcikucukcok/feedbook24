  <title>The Dancing Floor - Barbara Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For years, Heather Tradescant had dreamed of the journey she and her father would take to England--a pilgrimage to the great gardens of history.Now that her father is dead, Heather is determined to fulfill his dreams. Unfortunately, her request to see the fabled 17th-century garden of Troytan House is denied by the owner. Though unwelcome, she braves the walls of briars and reaches the Victorian manor house beyond. She senses a strange mission of evil lurking, tainting the manor&#39;s peaceful beauty. Only then does Heather begin to wonder whether it is only stories of long-vanished witchcraft that haunt Troytan House or whether there is some more modern horror, hearer at hand, and far, far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing in the classic tradition she established with such acclaimed novels of suspense as&lt;em&gt; Stitches in Time, Vanish with the Rose,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;House of Stone, New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Barbara Michaels has penned a chilling tale that will keep you reading until the last page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
