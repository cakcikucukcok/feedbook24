          &lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s Getting In Trouble For All The Right Reasons!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For thirteen-year-old Nick Donner, it was worth getting into some trouble to match his mom, Lucy, with Judge Kincaid&#39;s son, Logan. Now Nick&#39;s doing community service at Logan&#39;s animal clinic, hoping he can bring the lovelorn loners together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For Lucy, keeping her son as the only &quot;man&quot; in her life was safer for her fragile heart. And Logan had had his share of women who tried to change a man and drag him to the Land of Commitment and Fatherhood. Still, neither of them could deny that nagging attraction…and since fate had brought them together, what harm could come of a little fling?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Poor Lucy and Logan! They had no idea their matchmaker would leave nothing to chance…&lt;/p&gt;
