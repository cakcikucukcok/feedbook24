  <title>Silver (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Penny Jordan is an award-winning&lt;/em&gt; New York Times &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Sunday Times&lt;em&gt; bestselling author of more than 200 books with sales of over 100 million copies. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection of her novels, many of which are available for the first time in eBook right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When her father died Geraldine Frances&#39;s lifestyle changed forever. As a plain and overweight teenager, her dreams were shattered when the man with whom she was infatuated bitterly betrayed her, leaving her with one all consuming passion . . . revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She resorted to the drastic measures of plastic surgery and rigorous exercise to create a stunning new face and slender body. She had become ‘Silver’ - a hauntingly beautiful and mysterious woman few men would be able to resist. Dramatically transformed, she was almost ready to confront the man who had rejected her years before. Just one final hurdle had to be overcome and here, the ruthless, uncompromising Jake Fitton could provide all the necessary expertise – and so an extraordinary alliance was formed!&lt;/p&gt;
