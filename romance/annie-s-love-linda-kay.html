  <title>Annie’S Love - Linda Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Annie Ribold was a child of the 60s, a time in history when the generations of teens and parents were vastly separated. Many young people were leaving home to join communes and alienating their parents, leaving families torn apart by their differences in politics and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mothers love comes in many forms, and Annies Love will give readers a better concept of mother love in the changing world of the 60s and 70s. Follow Jeff Lipton as he searches for his birth mother and his heritage. His investigation leads him from a cemetery in a small town in Iowa all the way to a local tavern in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annies Love is based on the print by C. Clyde Squires, entitled Mother Love, one of five prints depicting the various stages of love. These prints are in a frame given to my grandmother for a shower gift in 1916. The print was handed down to my mother and finally to me. Looking at these pictures, kept in my family for so many years, Annies Love is the first product of my imagination. My goal is to publish a series of five books, one for each of these beautiful prints.&lt;/p&gt;
