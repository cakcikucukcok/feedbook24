      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sidelined by a potentially career-ending injury, the only thing hockey player Ryan Douglas should be thinking about is his recovery. But after sharing a near death experience with a spunky brunette, the only thing on his mind is five and a half feet of sexy sarcasm. And he&#39;ll do whatever it takes to get her back in his bed--even if it means playing dirty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chloe Jacobs is done with fairytales. And men. She&#39;s kissed her share of frogs and what&#39;s it gotten her? Dumped by text--again. The last thing she needs is a pushy, arrogant hockey player testing her resolve. Especially one who&#39;s sinfully good with his hands and thinks date-by-blackmail is a perfectly acceptable social convention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan wants to play games? Fine by her, but this is one faceoff he&#39;s going to lose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Risky Business series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Once Upon a Dare&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Once Upon a Power Play&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Seducing the Fireman&lt;/p&gt;" />

It's a sweet, sexy, funny read that is perfect for a pick-me-up and it's definitely put Jennifer Bonds on my radar and I can't wait to see more from this author. --Night Owl Reviews, Top Pick<br /><b><i>Once Upon a Power Play: Bonds, Jennifer: 9781682810392 ...</i></b> | Once Upon a Power Play is a great addition to Jennifer Bonds’ Risky Business series. Character-driven, the story very much focusses on Chloe and Ryan and considering I haven’t been overly impressed with many of the Brazen titles of late, this was a welcome discovery.<br /><b><i>Once Upon a Power Play (Risky Business, #2) by Jennifer Bonds</i></b> | I adored and loved Once Upon A Power Play by Jennifer Bonds. Being a Brazen book addict, this book had every element that I craved, wanted, needed and looked for. It had heat, romance, banter, playfulness, and of course lots and lots of steam.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Once Upon a Power Play - Jennifer Bonds</a> </h3></p><hr/>
