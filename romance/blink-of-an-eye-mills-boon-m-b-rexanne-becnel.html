  <title>Blink Of An Eye (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Rexanne Becnel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;She had nothing to lose…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To say that desperation clouded Jane Falgoust&#39;s judgment was a colossal understatement. With a hurricane bearing down on New Orleans, the failed nurse-turned-waitress viewed it as an &lt;em&gt;opportunity&lt;/em&gt;–to escape her tattered life. But then she saw the dog paddling frantically in the surging flood waters. She couldn&#39;t let this dog drown. From that one rescue, her nursing instincts kicked in and she started saving people–including herself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the hurricane subsided, Jane tended the wounded in Dr. Ben Comeaux&#39;s makeshift street clinic. Sure, her life had turned upside down in the blink of an eye–but that was bad only if you were in a good place to begin with. Now it was time to rebuild–her life, her city–on a foundation of hope.&lt;/p&gt;
