  <title>The Hollow - Nancy M. Hyde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Steven&#39;s Hollow is the last place Kathleen Mitchell wants to be. She vowed years ago to never set foot there again, and she is not returning now by choice. She&#39;s been summoned by a lawyer who discovered a problem with her long-ago divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life&#39;s been good for Kathleen...until now. But everything seems to be falling apart. What&#39;s going on? Is she divorced, or still married?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a secret she&#39;s been harboring in her heart for years. Her teenage son knows nothing about his biological father...not even his name. And the ex-husband Kathleen hasn&#39;t seen since before their divorce doesn&#39;t know he has a son...a son whose birth she kept secret from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when she thinks things can&#39;t possibly get worse, they do. The first person Kathleen sees when she arrives at Steven&#39;s Hollow is the man she thought she&#39;d never see again: Rob McKenzie, once the love of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They react to each other with bitterness and anger, at first...but the spark is still there. Rob McKenzie is the man Kathleen never forgot. Kathleen Mitchell is the woman Rob never got over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fourteen years apart, can they overcome the past and start again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
