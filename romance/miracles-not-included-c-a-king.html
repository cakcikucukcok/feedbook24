*********************
Chris was born to be a writer. Even the smallest of details couldn&#39;t pass without notice, often becoming part of a plot for her next novel. The one thing she never saw coming was her husband&#39;s sudden illness. 
Jason loved his wife from the moment they met. Nothing could ever change that – nothing except the death sentence he&#39;d been handed, a terminal cancer diagnosis.
His story was ending: Hers was starting a new chapter and more than one miracle was needed to turn the page." />
