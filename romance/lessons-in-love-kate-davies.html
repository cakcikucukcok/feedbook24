  <title>Lessons in Love - Kate Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tired of the paparazzi and wary of women only interested in his title, Alex du Charbonneaux, crown prince of Laurivenia, gets a little creative when describing the &quot;teaching job&quot; he&#39;s advertising. But Alex is surprised when the beautiful and bohemian Brynn arrives on his doorstep instead of the dowdy, respectful nanny he thought he&#39;d hired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brynn Dexter wants an adventure. What better way to get out of her judgey hometown and see the world than taking on a teaching job in a foreign country? But when she arrives in Laurivenia, she discovers the academy she thought she would be teaching at doesn&#39;t exist. Instead, she&#39;s faced with a sexy but suspicious prince and the cutest five-year-old girl she&#39;s ever met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can the free-spirited teacher give a buttoned-up royal a lesson in letting go? And will they get a chance to find some common ground once the paparazzi suspect there might be a fairytale story to uncover?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Royals and Rebels Series is STANDALONE.&lt;br&gt;Lessons in Love&lt;br&gt;Lessons in Trust&lt;/p&gt;" />
