      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;f you can&#39;t take the heat...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chef Emily Ford has the talent and ambition to make it in the cutthroat culinary world--which is why she refuses to accept her demotion at the hands of Knox Briscoe, the new CEO of Briscoe Ranch Resort. He has grand plans that include bringing in a celebrity chef to helm an exciting new restaurant at the resort, but Emily has plans of her own--to do whatever it takes to change his mind...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;ONE MORE TASTE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut out of the Briscoe fortune by an old feud that left his family in ruins, Knox grew up dreaming of revenge. Out-maneuvering his uncle for control of Briscoe Ranch is merely the first step in a grand plan that doesn&#39;t include the brazen and beautiful Emily Ford...or the attraction that sizzles between them. With both their futures on the line, can they keep their desires on simmer--or are they headed from the frying pan straight into the fire?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return to Brisoce Ranch Resort in the second book in Melissa Cutler&#39;s One and Only Texas series!&lt;/p&gt;" />
