          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Seduced by the Sultan&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Catrin Thomas’s life was perfectly normal until she was swept into a steamy affair with a desert sultan. When heartbroken Catrin then defies him, sexy, all-powerful Murat is determined to reclaim her, but she will not be his mistress while he weds someone else!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Undone by the Sultan’s Touch&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Khaled bin Aziz needs a wife to unite his warring country and innocent traveller, Cleo Churchill is perfect. Cleo fears their marriage is no more than convenience. But, as it plays out in the darkness of the night, the passions unearthed threaten to consumer them both!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Seducing His Princess&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, Prince Mohab risked his life to save Jala Aal Masood, igniting her desires…only to betray her trust. But now, as a new king, this ruthless seducer is back and determined to make Jala his wife! Will this mean a second chance or more heartbreak when their dark secrets are revealed?&lt;/p&gt;
