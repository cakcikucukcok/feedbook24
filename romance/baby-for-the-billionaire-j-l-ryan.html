  <title>Baby For The Billionaire - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;An adrenaline-packed billionaire steamy romance for fans of Fifty Shades Of Grey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frantic after getting fired, curvy girl Marisa Jamison is ecstatic when she gets a new job at a law firm. There, she meets gorgeous bad boy billionaire, Jeffrey Bradley.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His mind-blowing good looks and hypnotic eyes make her all sweaty, even though she rarely gets turned-on by a guy solely because of his looks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s only one problem...he&amp;#39;s so rude and arrogant that she wonders if it&amp;#39;s worth it. Even so, she fantasizes about sleeping with him and wants him so bad that she can&amp;#39;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marisa knows there&amp;#39;s not a snowball&amp;#39;s chance in hell that Jeffrey will give her a second look. She&amp;#39;s always been self-conscious about her weight and has yet to find a guy who loves her for her big beautiful curves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s something about Marisa that Jeffrey can&amp;#39;t resist, and he becomes obsessed with her. He&amp;#39;s usually not attracted to larger women, but ever since meeting her, he has shameless urges and cravings to see her naked body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is his fascination&amp;nbsp;wth&amp;nbsp;Marisa simply the result of a workplace crush, or is he hiding a scandalous secret so heart-pounding that it could put both their lives in jeopardy?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If you love steamy billionaire romance, bad boy romance, BBW romance, angsty romance, a good billionaire love story, bad boy alphas, or second chance romance books, don&amp;#39;t miss this BBW plus size romance book!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buy Now!&lt;/b&gt;" />
