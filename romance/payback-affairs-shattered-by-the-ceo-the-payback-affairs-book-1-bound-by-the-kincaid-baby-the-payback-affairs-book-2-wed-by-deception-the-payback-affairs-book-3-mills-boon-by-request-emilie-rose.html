  <title>Payback Affairs: Shattered by the CEO (The Payback Affairs, Book 1) / Bound by the Kincaid Baby (The Payback Affairs, Book 2) / Wed by Deception (The Payback Affairs, Book 3) (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Emilie Rose</title>

        &lt;p&gt;SHATTERED BY THE CEO&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CEO Rand Kincaid has been backed into a corner under the stipulations of his father’s will: rehire Tara Anthony as his assistant or lose his family empire. But Tara has plans of her own and that includes Rand back in her home and bed! Bound by the Kincaid Baby Mitch Kincaid has to gain custody of Carly Corbin’s baby nephew or lose the family fortune, but when she refuses his cheque, Mitch lets them both move in… Now how long can Mitch resist the building attraction he feels for Carly?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;WED BY DECEPTION&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nadia Kincaid should have been filled with joy on seeing the man she loved alive after he supposedly died eleven years ago on their wedding day. But why is Lucas looking at her as if she’s the last person he wants to see?&lt;/p&gt;
