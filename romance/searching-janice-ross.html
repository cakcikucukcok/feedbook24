  <title>Searching - Janice Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Wade Franklin returns to his hometown of Taylors Crossing, Georgia, his future hangs in the balance. He is in love with his lifelong friend and college sweetheart, Pamela Palmer, but will she take him back after a two-year absence? He left without saying goodbye or giving any explanation, and now it is time to reveal his reasons for doing so.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pam is finally making a life of her own as editor of the local newspaper, the Taylor Times, and her world is shaken when Wade returns to town. An incidental meeting provides the opportunity to renew their friendship, and both are keenly aware that the bond between them is still very strong. As their relationship deepens, Wade is completely honest with Pam, and his story launches them on a path that literally changes their lives. His truthfulness about his fathers undercover assignment and unsolved murder sets the stage for a web of intrigue that reaches from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching is a poignant story of love, faith, and the certainty of Gods provision in times of need. It presents an intricately woven tapestry of characters who struggle with the flaws of humanitybroken hearts, shattered dreams, and painful memories. From beginning to end, their lives are under the watchful eye and the guiding hand of the Lord, as he awakens their hearts to an awareness of who he is and offers love, forgiveness, and salvation to those who seek him in faith.&lt;p&gt;" />
