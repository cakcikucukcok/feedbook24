          &lt;strong&gt; Will this billionaire boss fall for his assistant…and her baby? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Putting his ravishing assistant in danger makes billionaire investigator Jack Carson uneasy. Till now, Jack&#39;s cared only about running his security company and bringing down the notorious O&#39;Shea family. But using Vivianna Smith to infiltrate their organization has complicated his priorities. And burying himself in work is no longer protecting him from his feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The seismic attraction he&#39;s been suppressing has been tough enough. But watching Viv care for the baby she&#39;s fostering stirs up emotions from his tragic past. Despite Jack&#39;s certainty that Viv is hiding something, his raging desire is driving him to the limits of his self-control…&lt;/p&gt;
