  <title>To Have and to Hold - Mike Deakin, Celia Deakin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A  Journey of Faith, Hope and Discovery!
If you could meet me today, you would see a bright, confident woman, happy relaxed; content with my situation, looking forward to a future of better things. However, it wasnt always like that.  When my husband left me for another woman, I was devastated!  Werent we both Christians who didnt believe in divorce?
            However, God gave me a promise that He would restore him so whilst I had to get on with life, I also held onto the promise.  Mike, having walked away tried to wash his hands of God! Yet he never lost the knowledge that God loved him, even though his life was not honouring Him.
Over a period of 18 years God worked in each of our lives like a Master Craftsman, in order to bring two individuals together and make them one. 
God has a plan and purpose for all our lives and as we get to know Him, so He reveals the plan.  We are glad He doesnt show it to us all at once.  We would not be able to cope with the dark threads of lifes tapestry but God weaves them together with gold, silver and brightly coloured threads so that we can look back and rejoice in His beautiful handiwork!
God is always faithful to His Word but often we are not willing to wait around to see its fulfilment; but patience and obedience allows the love of Jesus to transform us and our situations.  As we surrender to His perfect Will for our lives He is able to do exceedingly, abundantly, above all that we could ask or imagine!  Eph 3:20
For with man this is impossible but with God
 ALL things are possible!   Matt 19:26" />
