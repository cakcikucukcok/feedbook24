  <title>Peter Gzowski - R.B. Fleming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born in 1934, Peter Gzowski covered most of the last half of the century as a journalist and interviewer. This biography, the most comprehensive and definitive yet published, is also a portrait of Canada during those decades, beginning with Gzowski&#39;s days at the University of Toronto&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Varsity&lt;/i&gt; in the mid 1950s, through his years as the youngest-ever managing editor of &lt;i&gt;Maclean&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; in the 1960s and his tremendous success on CBC&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Morningside&lt;/i&gt; in the 1980s and 1990s, and ending with his stint as a &lt;i&gt;Globe and Mail &lt;/i&gt;columnist at the dawn of the 21st century and his death in January 2002. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gzowski saw eight Canadian Prime Ministers in office, most of whom he interviewed, and witnessed everything from the Quiet Revolution in Québec to the growth of economic nationalism in Canada&#39;s West. From the rise of state medicine to the decline of the patriarchy, Peter was there to comment, to resist, and to participate. Here was a man who was proud to call himself Canadian and who made millions of other Canadians realize that Canada was, in what he claimed was a Canadian expression, not a bad place to live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
