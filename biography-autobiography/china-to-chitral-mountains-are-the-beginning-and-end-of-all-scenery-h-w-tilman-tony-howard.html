  <title>China to Chitral: Mountains are the beginning and end of all scenery - H.W. Tilman, Tony Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#39;Upon this trackless waste of snow, cut by a shrewd wind they sat down and wept.&#39;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;China to Chitral&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;H.W. &#39;Bill&#39; Tilman&lt;/b&gt; completes one of his great post-war journeys. He travels from Central China, crossing Sinkiang, the Gobi and Takla Makan Deserts, before escaping to a crumbling British Empire with a crossing of the Karakoram to the new nation of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1951 there still persisted a legend that a vast mountain, higher than Everest, was to be found in the region, a good enough reason it seems for Tilman to traverse the land, &lt;i&gt;&#39;a land shut in on three sides by vast snow ranges whose glacial streams nourish the oases and upon whose slopes the yaks and camels graze side by side; where in their felt yorts the Kirghiz and Kazak live much as they did in the days of Genghis Khan, except now they no longer take a hand in the devastation of Europe&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widely regarded as some of Tilman&#39;s finest travel writing, &lt;i&gt;China to Chitral&lt;/i&gt; is full of understatement and laconic humour, with descriptions of disastrous attempts on unclimbed mountains with Shipton, including Bogdo Ola-an extension of the mighty Tien Shan mountains-and the Chakar Aghil group near Kashgar on the old silk road. His command of the Chinese language-five words, all referring to food-proves less than helpful in his quest to find a decent meal: &lt;i&gt;&#39;fortunately, in China there are no ridiculous hygienic regulations on the sale of food&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. Tilman also has several unnerving encounters with less-than-friendly tribesmen ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilman starts proper in Lanchow where he describes with some regret that he is less a traveller and more a passenger on this great traverse of the central basin and rim of mountain ranges at Asia&#39;s heart. But Tilman is one of our greatest ever travel writers, and we become a passenger to his adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
