  <title>Mary’S Prayer - Mary McGuinness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This memoir of Marys spiritual journey of self-discovery to find inner peace spans a period of fourteen years in which she was unable to find work due to illness. Throughout this period, she began to search for answers herself, which resulted in studying for a degree in psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music of John Lennon and The Beatles has always been important to Mary, and it was through this music that the healing process began. John Lennons character had inspired her throughout her life, particularly in his work for peace with his wife, Yoko Ono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music in general was very important to the journey that Mary travelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marys faith was paramount to the healing process, and she visited the Shrine of Lourdes in France, which was a turning point in her life. In the Church of Frauenkirche in Munich, Mary also felt as though she had received a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support of Marys family was very important to her recovery. The psychology studies, in particular those of social psychology, impacted on Marys understanding of the illness and motivated her to engage in her own personal research. This has ultimately influenced this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to John Lennons song, In My Life, the people that Mary met and the places that she visited along the journey were essential to initiate changes in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Construction Theory and the New Thought Movement were pivotal in changing Marys attitudes and promoted a new way of thinking, which impacted on her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, visiting Liverpool, England, re-energized Mary, and it was critical in changing her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that this story would inspire others who are hoping to make similar changes in their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
