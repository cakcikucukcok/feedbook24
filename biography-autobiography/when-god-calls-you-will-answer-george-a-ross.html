  <title>When God Calls, You Will Answer! - George A. Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is never too late, nor can you ever get so far from God that He will not accept you. Jesus said, &amp;quot;Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me&amp;quot; (Revelation 3:20). He is standing at the door and asking all of us to knock. He said if any man, woman, boy or girl has a voice, they should call out to him and He will answer. Salvation is for everyone! If we have but a little faith, He can work wonders for the lost. We cannot wait for a time we think we are worthy enough to approach God&amp;mdash;we&amp;#39;d be waiting a life time! Jesus said, &amp;quot;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light&amp;quot; (Matthew 11:28-31). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &amp;quot;When God Calls, You Will Answer,&amp;quot; George Ross encourages you to come and receive the saving grace that only Jesus can provide. Jesus has already completed the redemptive work for you. All you have to do is surrender to Him. Jesus taught us how to live in God&amp;#39;s grace. Grace is an unmerited, free gift from the throne room of God and His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord." />
