  <title>Well, That Escalated Quickly - Franchesca Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this sharp, funny, and timely collection of personal essays, veteran video blogger and star of MTV&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Decoded&lt;/i&gt; Franchesca Ramsey explores race, identity, online activism, and the  downfall of real communication in the age of social media rants, trolls, and call-out  wars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Franchesca Ramsey didn&#39;t set out to be an activist. Or a comedian. Or a  commentator on identity, race, and culture, really. But then her YouTube  video &quot;What White Girls Say . . . to Black Girls&quot; went viral. Twelve  million views viral. Faced with an avalanche of media requests, fan  letters, and hate mail, she had two choices: Jump in and make her voice  heard or step back and let others frame the conversation. After a crash  course in social justice and more than a few foot-in-mouth moments, she  realized she had a unique talent and passion for breaking down  injustice in America in ways that could make people listen and engage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  In  her first book, Ramsey uses her own experiences as an accidental  activist to explore the many ways we communicate with each other--from  the highs of bridging gaps and making connections to the many pitfalls  that accompany talking about race, power, sexuality, and gender in an  unpredictable public space...the internet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Well, that Escalated Quickly&lt;/i&gt; includes Ramsey&#39;s advice on dealing with internet trolls and  low-key racists, confessions about being a former online hater herself,  and her personal hits and misses in activist debates with everyone from  bigoted Facebook friends and misguided relatives to mainstream  celebrities and YouTube influencers. With sharp humor and her trademark  candor, Ramsey shows readers we can have tough conversations that move  the dialogue forward, rather than backward, if we just approach them in  the right way." />
