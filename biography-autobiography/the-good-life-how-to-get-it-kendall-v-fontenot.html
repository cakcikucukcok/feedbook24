  <title>The Good Life &amp; How To Get It - Kendall V Fontenot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since birth Kendall V. Fontenot was never the type to limit himself nor his potential to the stereotyped views of others. Fontenot was clearly an independent, out-of-the-box thinker, from the time he was a little tot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fontenot was only seven years old when he first stumbled across the laws of supply, demand and profit.&amp;nbsp; His very first foray into the realm of business began at school, as a precocious pencil salesman&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;serving his peers&amp;rsquo; insatiable appetite for demolishing pencils in a popular kid&amp;rsquo;s game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discovering how to turn one quarter into two, it was as if young Fontenot had discovered an enthralling new magic trick, called business. Fascinated now, young Fontenot dedicated his entire childhood to tinkering with business idea after business idea, to create profit for himself&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;and to financially unburden his mother after his parents&amp;rsquo; painful separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with all of the regular coming-of-age challenges that a young man faces in school, family, and neighborhood life, Fontenot somehow managed to carve out a business schooling of his own making.

He believed and continues to believe that hard work, good work and achievement is all the merit one needs regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as a young successful African American entrepreneur, Fontenot wants to share his success tips to a generation of American youth and beyond. Fontenot believes that dreams become available when families can live in abundance and not want.
