  <title>The Tobacco People - Michael K. Frenz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here is the ultimate crime book, and it is all legal.
An addiction to cigarettes drives a man over the edge into a new world of health and happiness. A great governing of tobacco over his younger years led to him quitting smoking before death occurred. This quitting comes from a breakdown on Christmas 2013an appropriate date in history for a man destined to quit. He makes the decision to quit as forced by his marriage, the law, a coma that robbed him of three weeks of his life, and a brush with death in a Boston ICU in a major hospital. All these put the author in the right situation to write three books in three years. He is now getting world-class treatment, getting one leg back for a transfer to HealthBridge, and years of care in rehabilitation." />
