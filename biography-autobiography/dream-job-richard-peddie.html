  <title>Dream Job - Richard Peddie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The former head of one of the most successful franchises in the world takes readers into the boardrooms and dressing rooms of major league sports.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of sports fans think they know how to run the home team better than the executive in charge of the operation. Such pressure is bound to teach a person a thing or two about leadership, humility and success. Richard Peddie, former president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment (MLSE), has clearly learned a few lessons during his years in the business, and now he shares them for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dream Job&lt;/em&gt; takes readers behind the scenes at MLSE and into the world of Richard Peddie, the man &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; magazine once called both &quot;a bum,&quot; based on the Leafs&#39; lacklustre performance, but also &quot;a wizard&quot; on the business side of professional sport. Entrepreneurs will be keen to learn how a working-class kid from Windsor who barely made it into university managed to reach the top of virtually every organization that ever hired him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Peddie tells stories from his inside vantage point: why the popcorn at Maple Leaf Gardens was always stale, the strange things that rock stars insisted on having backstage at the SkyDome, what it&#39;s like to be on the receiving end of death threats from a disgruntled fan, who were some of the quirkiest characters to have worn the Toronto Raptors uniform, and what happened the day it rained seat cushions at the Toronto Football Club&#39;s first home game. And, of course, he broaches the tricky business of hiring general managers and the awful business of firing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hockey, basketball and soccer fans and anyone who aspires to lead will all take something away from this fascinating, insightful and hard-hitting book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
