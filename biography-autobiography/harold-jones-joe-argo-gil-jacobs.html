  <title>Harold Jones - Joe Argo, Gil Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Singers Drummer chronicles the music and times of Harold Jones, a world class musician whose career spans the last five decades of jazz and big band swing music.
This book highlights Jones career as he evolved into the drummer of choice for some of our most popular vocal legends.  
But it is about much more than that.  It also gives us an entertaining insight into life on the road and is filled with Harolds insightful, sometimes humorous, anecdotes and musings about the famous sidemen, legendary jazz musicians and vocal headliners he has known; featuring more than 100 photos of his renowned friends.
Read The Singers Drummer and learn why Paul Winter called Harold the Michael Jordan of young jazz drummers in Chicago.
Read why Harold became acknowledged as Count Basies favorite drummer.  
And why Tony Bennett says This book is a knockout!  I am happy that someone is finally putting together a history of what really happens on the road!" />
