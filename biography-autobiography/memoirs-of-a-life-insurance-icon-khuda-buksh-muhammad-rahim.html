  <title>Memoirs of a Life Insurance Icon: Khuda Buksh - Muhammad Rahim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Memoirs of a Life Insurance Icon: Khuda Buksh illustrates the life of a legendary Insurance Specialist who chose to serve humanity by sparking an insurance awareness movement in three countries (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh). Between 1930 and 1970, Khuda Buksh worked tirelessly to establish the insurance business in the region, overcoming engrained religious and cultural prejudices against life insurance amid enormous political upheaval.  His passion, devotion, and unique sales strategies led him to train, motivate, and manage thousands of salesmen during his long career.  He earned a reputation as the countrys most magnetic and dynamic sales executive and wizard of life insurance.  He  played a role as an educator to the vast number of field force who placed faith in his leadership and took insurance as career.  His leadership strategies helped life insurance  to flourish and to penetrate  nearly every portion of society.  Compiled more than 35 years after Khuda Bukshs death, this book uses interviews with dozens of contemporaries and family members who reminiscence  Khuda Bukshs personality and  role in promoting  life insurance  in  Bangladesh and Pakistan.    
 He is one figure among Bengali Muslims who popularized life insurance among the people.  His name itself is an  
 institution and in his own lifetime he became a legendary figure. . . 
                                                                                                    Dacca Rotary News
  He was an outstanding salesman who even in his dreams would only be able to think of life insurance; he was totally obsessed by it.  A typical Bengali, small body, but with a big heart for everyone. . . he rose to the occasion 
and became a very big  name in the field of life insurance. . . 
                                                     Wolfram W. Karnowski  
   I still think if we measure with a balance between life insurance and Khuda Bukshit will be extremely difficult to  measure, which one is heavier. A wizard with a legendary stature in insurance . . .  
   -S. R. Khan        
   Mr. Khuda Buksh would be very personally involved in the welfare and the personal interest of each field worker . . .  As far as the life insurance industry in Pakistan is concerned, especially in the 50s and 60s, Khuda Bukshs role was undoubtedly the greatest. . .  
                                                   Joseph M. Pereira                                            
  He used to say: think of insurance, dream of insurance, sleep of insurance. Devote your time to insurance  . . .  He was an unbeatable legend of insurance. . . 
 Sharafat Ali Qureshi
  He was a very good leader, and this was apparent from the fact that he could train not one, but hundreds, and thousands of people. All his subordinates were just like his children . . .
M. A. Chishti 
    I used to hear about the great reputation of this giant personality of the life insurance arena. When I came to know him from close, I had no problem realizing the appropriateness of the title father of insurance by which he 
 was  known in this part of the world. . .
