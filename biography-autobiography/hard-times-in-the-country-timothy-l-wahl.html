  <title>Hard Times in the Country - Timothy L. Wahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Timothy Wahl grew up on a dairy farm in the town of Andover, New York. A restless youth who hangs out with other farm boys dreams big and is bound and determined to make his mark on the world.&lt;p&gt; 
But reality is a wet blanket. He not only feels out of place but IS out of place. He scores mediocre grades, plays sports clumsily, and contemplates without much success a future of fanfare and celebration.&lt;p&gt; 
One of the few places where he feels like he belongs is in Mr. MacCraes art class, which also serves as a dumping ground for miscreants and the troubled. No one knows just how troubled Timothy is until the summer of his senior year.&lt;p&gt; 
If Timothy has any chance of overcoming his troubles and finding his place in the world, hell have to find answers in uncommon places, and most importantly grow up. His life depends on it.&lt;p&gt; 
Join Timothy as he finds adventure in a world where girls love The Beatles, neighbors still know each other, and where roots run deep. The good life may be just around the bend, but for now, its Hard Times in the Country." />
