  <title>In a Heartbeat - Leigh Anne Tuohy, Sean Tuohy, Sally Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the first time, the remarkable couple depicted in &lt;i&gt;The Blind Side&lt;/i&gt; tells their own deeply inspiring story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First came the bestselling book, then the Oscar-nominated movie--the story of Michael Oher and the family who adopted him has become one of the most talked-about true stories of our time. But until now, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy have never told this astonishing tale in their own way and with their own words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Leigh Anne and Sean, it all begins with family. Leigh Anne, the daughter of a tough-as-nails U.S. Marshal, decided early on that her mission was to raise children who would become &quot;cheerful givers.&quot; Sean, who grew up poor, believed that one day he could provide a home that would be &quot;a place of miracles.&quot; Together, they raised two remarkable children--Collins and Sean Jr.--who shared their deep Christian faith and their commitment to making a difference. And then one day Leigh Anne met a homeless African-American boy named Michael and decided that her family could be his. She and her husband taught Michael what this book teaches all of us: Everyone has a blind side, but a loving heart always sees a path toward true charity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Oher&#39;s improbable transformation could never have happened if Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy had not opened their hearts to him. In this compelling, funny, and profoundly inspiring book, &lt;i&gt;In a Heartbeat&lt;/i&gt;, the Tuohys take us on an extraordinary journey of faith and love--and teach us unforgettable lessons about the power of giving.&lt;/p&gt;" />
