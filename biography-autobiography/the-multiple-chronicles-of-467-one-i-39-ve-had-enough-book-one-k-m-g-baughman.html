  <title>The Multiple Chronicles of 467 + One: I&#39;ve Had Enough! Book One - K. M. G. Baughman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What happens when the mind of an abused child breaks and can take no more? This is one such story. My story is a true story. But in my case, unlike any other true story of abuse, I suffer from a multitude of disorders as the result. I suffered thirty-four and a half years of physical, mental, verbal, and sexual abuse - even incest, beginning before the age of two. As a result, I buried everything to escape. What you will read here is the beginning of my journey to a healthy life. I am a divorcee for the fourth time, raising my seven-year-old daughter on my own. All we want is to be happy, healthy, and safe. That is all I ever wanted for Katie. That is what we are both in desperate search for, and we think we have finally found our happiness...or have we? Take this journey with us, and we will learn the truth together." />
