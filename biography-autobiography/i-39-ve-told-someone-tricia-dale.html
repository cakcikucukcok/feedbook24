  <title>I&#39;ve Told Someone - Tricia Dale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It took the author just over two years, a tremendous amount of determination and commitment, and lots and lots of practice to become the person she is today. She knew she was getting there when she was walking in the local neighborhood and passed a gang of young children playing in the street. She walked on and heard the pitter patter of tiny footsteps behind her. A little girl, around six years old, patted me on the backside and said, Excuse me, but you&#39;re not a real girl are you? She put her perfectly manicured finger to her lips and said, Sshh, don&#39;t tell anyone. She kept walking, but as she turned the corner, a shrill voice shrieked out I&#39;ve told someone Instead of being offended, she burst out laughing. She&#39;s since dressed on coaches, trains, buses, and trams. She&#39;s dressed in Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Blackpool, Carlisle, and London. She&#39;s even been round the Houses of Parliament dressed. The world awaits-but is it ready?" />
