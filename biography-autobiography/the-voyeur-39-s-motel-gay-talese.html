  <title>The Voyeur&#39;s Motel - Gay Talese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;On January 7, 1980, in the run-up to the publication of his landmark bestseller &lt;I&gt;Thy Neighbor&amp;#8217;s Wife&lt;/I&gt;, Gay Talese received an anonymous letter from a man in Colorado. &amp;#147;Since learning of your long awaited study of coast-to-coast sex in America,&amp;#8221; the letter began, &amp;#147;I feel I have important information that I could contribute to its contents or to contents of a future book.&amp;#8221; The man went on to tell Talese an astonishing secret, that he had bought a motel to satisfy his voyeuristic desires. He had built an attic &amp;#147;observation platform,&amp;#8221; fitted with vents, through which he could peer down on his unwitting guests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unsure what to make of this confession, Talese traveled to Colorado where he met the man&amp;#151;Gerald Foos&amp;#151;verified his story in person, and read some of his extensive journals, a secret record of America&amp;#8217;s changing social and sexual mores. But because Foos insisted on remaining anonymous, Talese filed his reporting away, assuming the story would remain untold. Now, after thirty-five years, he&amp;#8217;s ready to go public and Talese can finally tell his story.  &lt;I&gt;The Voyeur&amp;#8217;s Motel&lt;/I&gt; is an extraordinary work of narrative journalism, and one of the most talked about books of the year.&lt;/div&gt;" />
