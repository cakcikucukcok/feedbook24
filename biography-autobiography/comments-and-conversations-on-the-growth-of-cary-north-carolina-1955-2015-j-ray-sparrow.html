  <title>Comments and Conversations On the Growth of Cary, North Carolina, 1955-2015 - J. “Ray” Sparrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is not often that you run across a citizen who knows more than anyone else about a small town that he wasn&#39;t even born in. Ray Sparrow adopted Cary, North Carolina in 1956, just about the time it began to grow by leaps and bounds. Although he says this book is not about him, when you read his observations on his participation in Cary&#39;s growth spurt over the last 60 years, his place is undeniable. One feels as if they are right there beside him in a big comfy chair listening to him reflect upon the people he has met and worked with over the years to make Cary a better place to live.  Ray, a designer and builder of many of Cary&#39;s finest homes and businesses, not only worked with Cary&#39;s leaders, he was an ambassador of good will, running a business that put him in touch with people far and wide; many who came to Cary because of him. Ray Sparrow likes people, building their homes, getting to know their families, making friends with them." />
