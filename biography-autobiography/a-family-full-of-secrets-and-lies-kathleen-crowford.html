  <title>A Family Full of Secrets and Lies - Kathleen Crowford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story tells of rape, molestation, inhumane punishment, brutal acts of inconceivable horror, and unbearable torment. What makes it even more horrific is that these vicious, insane crimes were all committed by the hands of their own biological father.
You will cry as you hear their stories. You will sit in awe as you read page after page of an evil man whose character and nature can only be described as that of Satan himself.
How could this happen? How could cruelty go unnoticed, when the children, as they tell their story, had to go to school, with their blouses sticking to them because of the blood that would seep through the open wounds and welts all over their innocent little bodies? Where are they now? What is life like for them now? There is no happy ending for some of them that we all would hope to read about. But their desire is to bring attention to the many other families and children like us. The last request of our dying mother was for someone out of her children to please tell our story not so much for us now but for other families or individuals that are going through this sort of thing right now, for them to know that they are not alone. No matter what it looks like, you are going to come out of this. There is help for you. There is hope for you as long as there is breath in your body. Dont be afraid. And please do notI repeat, do notbe ashamed to go get help. Get help for the abused, get help for the lost, get help for the broken. Come now, walk with us, as we share our story of a family full of secrets and lies . . ." />
