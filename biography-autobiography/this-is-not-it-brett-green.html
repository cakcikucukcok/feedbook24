  <title>This Is Not It! - Brett Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Any trauma life or death experience, can either make you stronger or wallow in despair. The choice each individual makes in that situation says a lot of who they are, but more importantly, who they will become!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett Green continues to strive and improve to meet challenges that doctors once thought impossible. Throughout his journey, his determination that This is Not it has become his mantra and has helped him to heal and rebuild a meaningful and joyful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett has come back from an ordeala journey that few can only imagine! He has persevered when the medical field gave up on him and told him, This was it!-- That there was little chance for further improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett chose not to accept that prognosis. For nearly six years he has worked through the adversity, the pain, coaxing his body to do what it didnt want to do, the heartbreaking disappointments and also the incredible highs of each success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his remarkable and unpredictable recovery, he may always be in need of some form of rehabilitation. Still, he has chosen to adapt! As he has adapted over time, so has his family, friends and loved ones! People no longer see what Brett may not be able to do  they only see what he can do and what he has accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett continues to go beyond boundaries - Brett lives! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bretts innermost passion is raising his children; and also helping other survivors in need of court or mental health services. He maintains his business and license to practice therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this book will offer valuable insight to others facing similar situations. If there is any support that Brett may provide or a service that he can perform to assist you, please feel free to contact him through &lt;/p&gt;
