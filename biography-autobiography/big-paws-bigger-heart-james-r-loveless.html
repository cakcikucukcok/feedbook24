  <title>Big Paws, Bigger Heart - James R. Loveless</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once in a lifetime a person may find the perfect dog, but to have two perfect dogs in a lifetime is practically unheard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;of. &lt;em&gt;Big Paws, Bigger Heart &lt;/em&gt;presents a story of that improbable situation as told by Finley, a Belgian Tervuren dog who came into the life of his adopted dad, Jim Loveless, to fill the enormous void left behind by the loss of Jims first dog, Brooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finley goes back in time to tell the legend of Brooks. He shares the heartwarming and often humorous tales of how Brooks shaped the lives of not only his owner but of a community by proving faithfulness meant more than championships. Part one of this true and inspiring story follows Brooks from his early days of fitting in with his newly adopted family until his forced retirement from the agility competition he and Jim so dearly loved due to bad hips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the loss of Brooks, Jim couldnt imagine that the void left behind could ever be filled. The sequel, however, recalls how Finley came along, picking up where Brooks left off. He exceeded Jims wildest expectations with his loyalty and unbelievable sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written from a dogs perspective, &lt;em&gt;Big Paws, Bigger Heart &lt;/em&gt;explores the love that dogs can bring into our lives and shows how two dogs changed one mans life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
