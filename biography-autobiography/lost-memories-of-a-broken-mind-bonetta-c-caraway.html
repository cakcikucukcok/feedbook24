      <meta name="description" content="Lost Memories of a Broken Mind is a follow-up story, It&#39;s My Life--Such As It Is and is the story of my life from age 2 to the present.   This is a story of life and how simple it was in 1940&#39;s, and how different country life was for a girl born in 1944.  Life being raised by all women until daddy comes home from the war and takes over his roll as head of the household.
As time and life goes on, my schooling , my maturing into a married woman, illness that is causing my memory loss, causing me to loose memories I won&#39;t be able to share with my future great grand children---so, thus the Lost Memories of a Broken Mind comes to light.  I wrote down memories before I my broken Mind lost them,  written as a journal as I was bedridden to keep the boredom from taking over.  
I just wanted to save some of the past for the future.......thus project ID 549956__&quot;Lost Memories of a Broken Mind.
