  <title>A Soul&#39;s Oasis - Carrie Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Terror seizes Carrie as she awakens to beads of sweat trickling onto her pillow. She fades back into a dream that reveals a steep staircase looming above her. A figure weighs heavily against her side, as she struggles upward, every step a tremendous effort. She knows this is her destiny. Sobs overtake her as she experiences overwhelming relief when the arduous ascent is finally over. The dream again takes her back down to the bottom of the stairs. She knows, without a doubt, the dream has revealed her life. The real journey has not yet begun. 
        The reader is taken into Carrie&#39;s thought processes through her husband&#39;s illness, a difficult marriage, and finally, divorce. As Carrie relies upon God to carry her through these tragic events, she discovers spiritual experiences and insights along the way. Self-preservation forces Carrie to progressively detach from herself until she completely unravels. The reader discovers that the story is about more than the dream. It is about Carrie&#39;s spiritual transformation, as she puts her life back together. In the process, the author inspires the reader toward his own healing journey. As Carrie awakens to the powerful spirit within her, the message ultimately becomes the truth - that we are all powerful, creative, beautiful and wonderful beings!" />
