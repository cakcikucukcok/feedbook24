  <title>The Rise of Rahm: Rahm Emanuel&#39;s Political Ascent, from Clinton through Congress to Obama&#39;s White House and Chicago&#39;s City Hall - Chicago Tribune Staff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;A collection of previously published &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt; articles, chronologically documenting Rahm Emanuel&amp;#8217;s meteoric rise to prominence in local and national politics.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For 20 years, one of the most dynamic, accomplished figures in American politics had never even been elected to a position of executive power. Then in early 2011, Rahm Emanuel was elected to supplant Richard M. Daley as mayor of Chicago. Comprised of two decades of &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt; articles, &lt;I&gt;The Rise of Rahm&lt;/I&gt; is a fast-paced retrospective on the bold, authoritative, and often controversial methods of Rahm Emanuel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Rise of Rahm&lt;/I&gt; tracks the ascent of Emanuel from his direction of Bill Clinton&#39;s 1992 campaigns through his first year as mayor. In between, &lt;I&gt;The Rise of Rahm&lt;/I&gt; explores Emanuel&amp;#8217;s years in the Clinton and Obama White Houses, his 2002 congressional run, his exemplary orchestration of the 2006 Democratic sweep of Congress, as well as his successful mayoral campaign. Infamous stories are detailed of mailed fish and lost fingers, as well as countless examples of Emanuel&amp;#8217;s ruthless tactics and brazen vulgarities. &lt;I&gt;The Rise of Rahm&lt;/I&gt; is a gripping and telling read on Rahm Emanuel&#39;s political ascendance.&lt;/div&gt;" />
