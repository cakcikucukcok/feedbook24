  <title>The Wealth of My Mother&#39;s Wisdom - Terrence J</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s amazing how much my mom did on my behalf. As a seventeen-year-old single mom with relatively little support and all the chips stacked against her, she was able to provide an incredible amount of support for me. Her lessons enriched my spirit, my emotions, and my relationship with God.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lisa, a seventeen-year-old from Queens, New York, found out she was pregnant, she knew she only had one choice&amp;#8212;to keep the child and give him the best life she could. That baby was Terrence Jenkins, better known to the world as Terrence J. From hosting gigs on BET&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;106 and Park&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;E! News&lt;/em&gt; to roles in some of Hollywood&amp;#39;s biggest movies, Terrence J is living a life he could have only imagined when he was a young boy. But it was the lessons he learned from his mother that helped make him a man&amp;#8212;lessons about sacrifice, courage, loyalty, dreams, and perseverance. Through her words and her actions, Lisa showed Terrence the right path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an early age Terrence&amp;#39;s mother pushed him to succeed and led by example. Most important, she put her son first&amp;#8212;even if it meant leaving behind the only life she had ever known in New York City in search of a safer environment for her son, having the drive to go back to school to learn a new skill, or having the courage to start her own business and build it from the ground up. Her drive eventually became Terrence&amp;#39;s drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspirational, funny, current, and down-to-earth, &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of My Mother&amp;#39;s Wisdom&lt;/em&gt; offers advice for a new generation. With stories, lessons, and advice from one of the top young names in Hollywood, along with input from some of his famous friends like Kevin Hart, Ludacris, T.I., Trey Songz, and Laz Alonso, Terrence J offers a positive, powerful message: with a strong family bond, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;" />
