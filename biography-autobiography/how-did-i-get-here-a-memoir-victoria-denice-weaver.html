  <title>How Did I Get Here?: A Memoir - Victoria Denice Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Victoria Weaver grew up in a home where she witnessed constant drinking and fighting, and she heard cursing like she lived with sailors. This took place every weekend for years. She vowed to grow up, leave home, and put the childhood problems behind her. But that didn&#39;t happen, and Weaver experienced similar issues, similar feelings, and relationship patterns shortly after she moved out of that childhood family environment.   In How Did I Get Here?, Weaver shares her story. She tells how, after being in this relationship for 20 years (10 years married) and being a dedicated wife and mother, her husband shot her. The incident took place just after a family cruise celebrating their son&#39;s high school graduation.   In this memoir, Weaver narrates the series of events and the long road to recovery after the shooting. Emotional and heartfelt, she describes her feelings and emotions as she leaned on God and her family to help her through this difficult time." />
