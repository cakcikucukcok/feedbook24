  <title>Entwined Hearts - Jj Janice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As author JJ Janice reflects on her surprise connection with a mother-daughter duo, she finds herself, an outsider, overwhelmed by mysteries regarding the short time it took for her to become a new member in this tight-knit family with a complicated past. How did she get here? What forces are at work? Why was she chosen to be a witness? 
Using her diary as guide, she sifts through layers of her imagination and shares her story in Entwined Hearts. It chronicles the ascent of forgiveness by and for three women who perhaps least expect itall in two short years. Through the stories of Anita, who suffers from Alzheimers; Lynn, Anitas daughter who struggles with bi-polar disorder; and Janice, a friend to both, it investigates how relationships change and endure through challenges. 
Though this memoir touches on the difficult topics of Alzheimers, bipolar disorder, stress, drugs, incarceration, and alcoholism, it also looks at the world with kind generosity and lovea love that connected three unlikely women." />
