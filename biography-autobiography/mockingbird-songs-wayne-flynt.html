  <title>Mockingbird Songs - Wayne Flynt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An indelible portrait of one of the most famous and beloved authors in the canon of American literature&amp;#8212;a collection of letters between Harper Lee and one of her closest friends that reveals the famously private writer as never before, in her own words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violent racism of the American South drove Wayne Flynt away from his home state of Alabama, but the publication of &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;, Harper Lee&amp;#8217;s classic novel about courage, community, and equality, inspired him to return in the early 1960s and craft a career documenting and teaching Alabama history. His writing resonated with many Alabamians, in particular three sisters: Louise, Alice, and Nelle Harper Lee. Beginning with their first meeting in 1983, a mutual respect and affection for the state&amp;#8217;s history and literature matured into a deep friendship between two families who can trace their roots there back more than five generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flynt and Nelle Harper Lee began writing to one other while she was living in New York&amp;#8212;heartfelt, insightful, and humorous letters in which they swapped stories, information, and opinions on topics both personal and professional: their families, books, Alabama history and social values, health concerns, and even their fears and accomplishments. Though their earliest missives began formally&amp;#8212;&quot;Dear Dr. Flynt&quot;&amp;#8212;as the years passed and their mutual admiration grew, their exchanges became more intimate and emotional, opening with &quot;Dear Friend&quot; and closing with &quot;I love you, Nelle.&quot; Through their enduring correspondence, the Lees and the Flynts became completely immersed in each other&amp;#8217;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully written, intelligent, and telling, this remarkable compendium of their letters&amp;#8212;a correspondence that lasted for a quarter century, from 1992 until Harper Lee&amp;#8217;s death in February 2016&amp;#8212;offers an incisive and compelling look into the mind, heart, and work of one of the most beloved authors in modern literary history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
