&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    oday is Sunday, December 2, 2012. It is a beautiful day out here in Victoria, Mexico. It is the perfect day and weather to be out at the local weekly
    street fair. Rather, today I find myself sitting in my room, reflecting on my past, thinking about the present, and wondering what the future has in store
    for our family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I recently returned today from a weekend of hoops that began in Mexico City and ended in Acapulco, Mexico. We concluded our two game road trip last night
    in Acapulco as we pulled out a hard fought victory over the Guerreros of Chilpancingo. After traveling on our team bus all night and day, we returned
    safely back here just a few hours ago. Although I am pleased and happy with this past weekends results on the hardwood, nothing makes me smile as each day
    comes and goes, closer to the day I will finally get to hug, kiss, and hold you in my arms. I think about you all the time, son. In just a few short weeks,
    you will come into this world and be here with your family. It is a privilege and a blessing to be a father. I want to make you this promise now Lorenzo
    Karon Keeler Jr, I will strive to be the best provider, role model, motivator, friend, and father I can possibly be. I will always be here for you as long
    as I am living and breathing on this earth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I once heard a man say, There is no manual on how to be a good father. When I heard this a few years ago it struck me to be true. As I continued on this
    journey of life and went through trials, learned lessons, and gained knowledge over the last year, I no longer believe that statement to be true. I have
    gone through my fair share of ups, downs, tribulations, hurts, disappointments, and failures. It was through these challenges that I finally picked up a
    very exclusive manual and began to learn the lessons, knowledge, and wisdom it had to offer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In PROVERBS 23:12, Gods Word tells us, Apply your heart to instruction, And your ears to words of knowledge. It all began with me taking action and
    applying my heart to the word of the Lord. Now I know without a doubt in my mind that this manual, also known as the Holy Bible, is the ONLY road map to
    peace and an abundant, purposed life. The Bible can lead, guide, and teach every human being on earth how to become GREAT fathers, mothers, brothers,
    sisters, sons, daughters, etc. PROVERBS 19:8 says, He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Over the last year, I have gained much wisdom and knowledge from Gods mighty word. I realized if I just apply His counsel to my life, it will change my
    life for the better. PROVERBS 24:3-4, Through wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established; By knowledge the rooms are filled with all
    precious and pleasant riches. Applying the Lords counsel to our life is beneficial to us here on earth and qualifies us for eternal life in Heaven with
    our Heavenly Father. I pray I will be on this earth with you for many years to come. I pray I will be here from watching you take your first steps to
    witnessing you exchange vows with your beautiful bride on your wedding day. The fact of the matter is we do not know when it is our time to depart from
    this earth. Only God knows when our time is up and when our day is over. I could be here fifty more years or fifty more minutes. Because I do not know, I
    want to leave you with my story. It is through these events that I have learned valuable lessons. It is through these events that I realized true peace and
    happiness cannot be found in anything this world has to offer. I want you to be aware of the choices I made and the consequences that followed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    At 27 years old, many may say I am young and have much more living to do. Yes, I am young and I pray I have many more years ahead. However, I am thankful
    to be alive and in my right mind today. Believe me when I tell you, son, I once traveled on a path full of dangerous activities. I willfully participated
    in a life of sin and I could have been dead a long time ago. I am thankful for our Heavenly Fathers love, care, mercy, faithfulness, and protection even
    when I did not deserve it. I will be the first to admit I do not have it all figured out. As a matter a fact, I am still learning and growing daily.
    However, I do know one thing for certain. Without God in our life and the Holy Spirit leading and guiding us, we are not living.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    PROVERBS 9:10-12 tells us, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. For by me your days will
    be multiplied, And years of life will be added to you. If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And if you scoff, you will bear it alone.
