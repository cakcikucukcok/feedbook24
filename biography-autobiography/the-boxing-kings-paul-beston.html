  <title>The Boxing Kings - Paul Beston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For much of the twentieth century, boxing was one of America&amp;rsquo;s most popular sports, and the heavyweight champions were figures known to all. Their exploits were reported regularly in the newspapers&amp;mdash;often outside the sports pages&amp;mdash;and their fame and wealth dwarfed those of other athletes. Long after their heyday, these icons continue to be synonymous with the &amp;ldquo;sweet science.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Boxing Kings: When American Heavyweights Ruled the Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Paul Beston profiles these larger-than-life men who held a central place in American culture. Among the figures covered are John L. Sullivan, who made the heavyweight championship a commercial property; Jack Johnson, who became the first black man to claim the title; Jack Dempsey, a sporting symbol of the Roaring Twenties; Joe Louis, whose contributions to racial tolerance and social progress transcended even his greatness in the ring; Rocky Marciano, who became an embodiment of the American Dream; Muhammad Ali, who took on the U.S. government and revolutionized professional sports with his showmanship; and Mike Tyson, a hard-punching dynamo who typified the modern celebrity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gallery of flawed but sympathetic men also includes comics, dandies, bookworms, divas, ex-cons, workingmen, and even a tough-guy-turned-preacher. As the heavyweight title passed from one claimant to another, their stories opened a window into the larger history of the United States. Boxing fans, sports historians, and those interested in U.S. race relations as it intersects with sports will find this book a fascinating exploration into how engrained boxing once was in America&amp;rsquo;s social and cultural fabric.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
