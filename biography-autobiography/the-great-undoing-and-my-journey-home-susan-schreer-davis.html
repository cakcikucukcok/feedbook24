&lt;p&gt;Apprehensive, I slide it into a laptop and watch the scene from my past come to life. After viewing only part of it, he exits to do homework, pauses, and quips, What happened to you, Mom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time suspends as I search for a reply.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Life  life happened, Sama lot of life. Like your dad dying and you and I ending up with a genetic disorder. Muscle biopsies, spinal taps, surgeries, you know. Crazy stuff happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looks my way only somewhat understanding. His seventeen-year-old, senior-in-high-school self tries on my explanation, but it doesnt quite fit. He cant give in so why should I? 
&lt;p&gt;He continues up the stairs and I stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alone with the reality that the hard stuff is winning. That I caved under the pressure. That my tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed son knows who I was, compared to who I am.&lt;/p&gt;" />
