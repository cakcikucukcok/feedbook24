  <title>A Wolf at the Table - Augusten Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a little boy, I had a dream that my father had taken me to the woods where there was a dead body. He buried it and told me I must never tell. It was the only thing we&#39;d ever done together as father and son, and I promised not to tell. But unlike most dreams, the memory of this one never left me. And sometimes...I wasn&#39;t altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Augusten Burroughs was small, his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs, a cough from the basement, a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older, something sinister within his father began to unfurl.  Something dark and secretive that could not be named.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued, and Augusten&#39;s childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didn&#39;t exist for him. This father was distant, aloof, uninterested...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the &quot;games&quot; began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;A Wolf at the Table,&lt;/i&gt; Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate, the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight, it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal, &lt;i&gt;A Wolf at the Table&lt;/i&gt; will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive. It&#39;s a memoir of stunning psychological cruelty and the redemptive power of hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
