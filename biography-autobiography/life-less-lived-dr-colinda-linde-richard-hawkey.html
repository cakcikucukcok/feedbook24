  <title>Life Less Lived - Dr. Colinda Linde, Richard Hawkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It couldnt happen to me.
Richards a 39 year old happily married man with two wonderful children, a house in the suburbs and a station-wagon.  He buys clothes from the medium rack and has beige carpets in his house. He is Mr Average.
Why did the slow fuse of unmanaged stress smoulder for so long before finally igniting the depression that was more whimper than bang?
This is a raw and revealing look at how he succumbed to the demands of modern day metropolitan life; how he burnt out, slid into a severe clinical depression and lost all ability to function and feel basic emotions. 
It is also a tale of how he came through it, recovering himself and discovering a whole wonderful new way to live.
It is funny, shocking, sad, desperate, enlightening, inspirational and informative. It is also completely true.
This book is for anyone feeling stressed, worried they are burning out or who is currently suffering from depression and wants honest, practical advice on ways to cope and change their lives positively.
In other words  anyone,  drawing breath in the 21st Century.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This book has been declared a finalist in the International Book Awards &lt;/b&gt;" />
