  <title>Sardines in My Saddlebags - Joe T.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Denali, Alaska, was on a friends bucket list for his sixty-fifth year, and the author came along for the ride. His son sealed the deal by gifting him an Arai helmet for the Alaska-or-Bust journey. So, with a pat on the back from his Mayo Clinic doctors and toting ninety days of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Latanaprost in the saddlebags of his very heavily laden 2011 Heritage Softail Harley Davidson, he motored off as the third wheel. The bust occurred in Dodge City due to incompatibility with time, but Joe continued and made the trip his own in a wild and wonderful way. This is the journal and adventure of a crazy 60 year old, riding his Harley and camping with only a Rand McNally road atlas and a go-pay phone - 77 days @ 17,520 miles." />
