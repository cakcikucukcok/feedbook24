  <title>1947–1948 Returning to Usn - Robert S. Weil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After I retired from working, I decided that now that my wife of thirty-nine years had passed away, I needed to relate about the events I experienced for the benefit of my children.
I had been involved in working at several jobs over my lifetime, and I wanted my children to recognize what their parents had gone through. I wished my own parents had been able to relate what they had seen and experienced in their lives. But that was not to be. They were too busy trying to raise a growing family during the trying years of the Great Depression. I never agreed that there was anything great about the Depression of the 1930s. Possibly this will encourage others to take time to write of their own life for their children." />
