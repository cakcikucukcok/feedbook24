  <title>My Race with Diabetes and the Oli - Ed Espenshade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While growing up in Mount Holly, New Jersey, Ed Espenshade played catch with his dad, attended Phillies and Sixers games, and dreamed of being an athlete. But soon after he acquired a paper route as a twelfth birthday present, Ed was hit by a car while attempting to cross a road. After blood was drawn during an examination in the emergency room, Ed received shocking news: he had diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his path took an unexpected turn, Ed describes how he became more determined than ever to pursue his athletic goals. After an unsuccessful attempt at soccer, Ed eventually found his home as a cross country runner in high school and college. It seemed that Ed was defying all odds as he continued to run hundreds of road races that included four marathons. But everything changed in 2003 when Ed found himself face down on the street during a training run and soon received another stunning diagnosis: he had a rare nonmalignant brain tumor. As he details his continuing journey with two serious health conditions, Ed shines a light on the importance of keeping hope, faith, and perseverance alive in the face of lifes greatest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this inspiring memoir, a diabetic endurance athlete shares the story of how he has battled chronic illness by pushing through his hardships and never sacrificing his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
