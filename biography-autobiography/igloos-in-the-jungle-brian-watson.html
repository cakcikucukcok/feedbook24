  <title>Igloos in the Jungle - Brian Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Go along with the Colonel on this nostalgic trip back to the 1950&#39;s and life growing up in the Midwest. Follow him on his solo trek across Europe and the year that made him a man in the Aviation Cadet Program. Next it&#39;s many a day in Vietnam over the course of the war and the hardships faced by the aviators and their families on a daily basis. Life in the &quot;fast lane&quot; or five years in the Pentagon gives the reader a close look at the many challenges faced by the Staff Officer in the &quot;building&quot;. Finally, the harrowing experience of life in a high school classroom for 19 years caps off the interesting adventure.
Lt. Col. Watson amassed almost 5,000 hours flight time with 1,300 of it being combat time in Vietnam. He was &quot;in country&quot; for over 500 days covering parts of 1965,1966,1968,1969,1970,1971,1972, and 1973.He was decorated 39 times including the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, 12 Air Medals, 2 Commendations Medals, and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry just to mention a few. His travels took him north of the Arctic Circle to the southernmost tip of South America, all over Europe and the Far East with stops in 68 countries on 6 continents. Sit back, relax, and enjoy this most interesting story of an Air Force Officer and his travels in support of our national interests." />
