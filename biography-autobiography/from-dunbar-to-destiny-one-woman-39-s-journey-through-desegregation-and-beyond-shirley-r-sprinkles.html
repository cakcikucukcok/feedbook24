  <title>From Dunbar to Destiny: One Woman&#39;s Journey Through Desegregation and Beyond - Shirley R. Sprinkles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book chronicles the life of a black woman who was raised in Tucson, Arizona during the 1940&#39;s and early 1950&#39;s when public schools, public accommodations, as well as most other public entities, were racially segregated. The story tells how, during her developmental years, Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary and Junior High School&#39;s leader and its teachers prepared young Shirley Robinson for the many academic challenges and social obstacles that she would confront and overcome throughout her life. The role of integration at a critical stage in her schooling is vividly recalled by the author in her descriptions of key people who played significant roles in helping her to establish goals and pathways to a successful life. It is through these recollections and others that she weaves a tale of courage and indomitable spirit that carried her through a journey of difficult personal and professional trials to reach the station in life that she now enjoys." />
