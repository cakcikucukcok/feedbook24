  <title>Trapped - Alexandra Karb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Alexandra attempts to end an abusive marriage, her husband Tareq abducts their infant daughters from their Montreal home and deposits them with his family in a primitive village in Jordan.  Trying to retrieve them through legal means, Alexandra comes face to face with Arab cultures where children belong to the father’s family and women have no rights to them.  
She puts a promising career as a medical researcher on hold, sets off alone to Jordan and succeeds in an audacious plan to smuggle her daughters back home. But upon returning to Canada, she finds a judicial system that is unable to protect her children from being kidnapped again - this time for good, forcing her back to a life with the abusive husband.  For the next twenty years, while achieving a PhD and working as a respected scientist, she submits to her husband’s tyranny for the sake of her daughters. Her coping mechanism is to dissociate herself from constant verbal and emotional abuse and live as an observant stranger trapped in a life not of her making.
Alexandra’s long journey takes us from Canada to Germany, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, and finally back to Canada. With perceptive and sympathetic eyes, she offers us first-hand views of her life in a poor Jordanian village and in a Saudi city and workplace, and of the local customs under which she lived her family life in the Middle East.  Hers is also a story of the inner journey of a woman and mother who ultimately emerges from a wounded self towards freedom and joy." />
