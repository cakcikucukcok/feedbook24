  <title>Stranded - William McGaughey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So there I stood, in the middle of the busiest street in Bangkok. I had lost 50 pounds, I was broke, had no food, an expired visa and no ticket home. I was without a doubtstranded.
Stranded is the story of a young army brat struggling to find himself in the sex, drugs and rock and roll era that was the American hippy movement. At a vital age in his youth, Bill was forced to move to Southeast Asia, far from family, friends and anything he knew to be normal. After the dust of his culture shock settled, Bill&#39;s lust for adventure took over. He was determined to embrace everything this new world had to offer, but over the next few years he would become consumed by the darker side of Southeast Asia.
Bill&#39;s family later moved back to the States after his graduation from the International School of Bangkok, but not before the city had planted a burning desire in his heart to one day revisit his home away from home. After years of living a nomadic existence across the States, Bill finally fulfilled his dream of one day returning to Thailand. It wasn&#39;t long before he realized old habits die hard and that his carefree lifestyle would inevitably lead him down a path of self-destruction.
Bill&#39;s unique style of writing, coupled with an incredibly genuine approach to storytelling, allows the reader to feel as if they were right along with him for the ride. By the end of the story, you&#39;ll wonder how the two of you ever made it out of Bangkok alive." />
