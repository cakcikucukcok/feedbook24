  <title>Hallelujah Dave - David Valdez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A boy of Mexican immigrants has an unusual gift, the recollection of his birth. As he grows up in Middle America, he is rocked between mischief and love, elation and despair. He becomes entangled in the hippie movement of the 60s. Later, in the midst of his chemistry studies at the University of Illinois, he becomes ensnarled in the Vietnam antiwar movement. It is there, in high school and college, where his life goals are crystallized and he maps out his life. There are things that he must do and must become. Yet somehow, impacting him are three short letters he received in his life and a chance meeting that changes everything. Though he tries, he cannot escape his future. It was made with hands bigger than his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend, Dave Valdez, tells the very personal story of his life journey. Growing up in poverty, he beats the odds, as an unseen hand guides him through many situations and circumstances that would have defeated most. In todays education system, Dave would be labeled gifted and talented. In the 1950s he was labeled Mexican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave has a remarkable inner strength that fiercely hangs on to bits of praise and encouragement when life is unfair. He refuses to embrace bitterness. His is truly a story of hope.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As Dave navigates his teens years he develops a talent to avoid unwelcome conflicts. He runs. He runs from his mom, his dad, neighbors, and cops. But he could not outrun the unseen hand. At the University of Illinois, in his early 20s, he is challenged to consider the reality of God. So here, the young, rebellious, brilliant, chemistry major begins to stop running. A new chapter in his life begins to unfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave doesnt beat you over the head with his conversion experience, he reveals it as it happened, and asks you to consider the hope he has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah Dave is a great read. It is the true story of my friend, a man who discovers he is blessed and chooses to bless others. &lt;/p&gt;" />
