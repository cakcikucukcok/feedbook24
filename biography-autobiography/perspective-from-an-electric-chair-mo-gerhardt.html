  <title>Perspective from an Electric Chair - Mo Gerhardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Mo Gerhardt tells what it is like living life while being diagnosed with a terminal disease. Not only from all the bumps, bruises and surgeries from his muscular dystrophy, but also after broken bones from a bus accident and loss of vision in one eye due to a separate non-related medical condition.
Instead of taking his diagnosis as a death sentence, Gerhardt uses it as motivation to accomplish everything that a normal person aspires to. From receiving his Bachelors and Masters degrees from Michigan State University to competing and medaling in both national and international adaptive sports competitions, he continues to defy doctors predictions. He continues to give back through his motivational speaking to students and being an activist for the disability community.
Through it all, Gerhardt proves that its not the diagnosis that determines ones outcome." />
