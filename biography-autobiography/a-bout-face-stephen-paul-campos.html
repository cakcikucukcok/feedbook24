The above headlines caught the attention of the media in 2011, 2012 and 2013. 
Since that time the suicide rate in the military continues to increase. 
A-bout-FACE. A TRUE story about Stephen Paul Campos. At the age of 19 he enlisted in the US Army as a combat infantry rifleman. From April 1968 to April 1969 he served one year tour of combat duty with the 199th. Light Infantry Brigade. Within just two weeks he and his platoon experience a horrific friendly-fire tragedy that shakes him to his core. Along with many other veterans he returned home with Post-traumatic stress syndrome unable to integrate fully back into society. Two decades later, on the verge of suicide, he was able to turn his life around. Mr. Campos shares his experiences in combat and struggles with PTSD while trying to transition back into civilian life. This story will bring to light the effects of post-war stress, drugs and alcohol abuse. Also, included are his personal Steps to Recovery. You CAN Heal from the Demons of War
