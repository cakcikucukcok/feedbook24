  <title>The Secret They Kept from Me - Cathy Stockham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story of a secret that was kept from me until I was fifty-one years old. It all happened in a small Kansas Community that has a lot of pride and many secrets untold. You will want to read to the very last chapter to see how everything unfolds. My book reveals how my family handled this secret and what steps I took to come above it. 
	My first six chapters are about my familys life story. Introducing you to my family and community is helpful in setting the stage. It all starts out to be a basically normal childhood with stories that grip the readers. The fall of my parents marriage and the devastating affects of the divorce for my brother, my sister and I. The following chapters go deep into the family secret and how it all happened and why it was kept from everyone. Many facts go into this book that will be shocking to many. When the news was shared with other family members, their reaction was not pleasant and most of them were in denial. All the details revealed in my book and will open many hearts." />
