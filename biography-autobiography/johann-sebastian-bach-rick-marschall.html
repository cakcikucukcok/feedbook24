  <title>Johann Sebastian Bach - Rick Marschall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two-and-a-half centuries after his death, the complex life of composer Johann Sebastian Bach continues to fascinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Bach&#39;s colorful life was anchored in his belief that &quot;music has been ordered by God&#39;s Spirit&quot;?so much so that he began each composition by scrawling &lt;em&gt;Jesu, juva &lt;/em&gt;(Jesus, help me) at the top of a blank page and concluded each with S.D.G. (short for &lt;em&gt;Soli Deo Gloria&lt;/em&gt;, to God alone be the glory). Through the eyes of noted music and culture writer Rick Marschall, the intensely personal yet boldly public faith that earned Bach the nickname &quot;The Fifth Evangelist&quot; takes on fresh meaning.&amp;nbsp;From a survey of Bach&#39;s family and its deep Christian roots to a behind-the-scenes look at how he crafted his masterpieces, this book paints a picture of an astonishing figure and his relationship with his God.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Marschall brings Bach&#39;s enduring music and influence to the postmodern world and to all who would draw inspiration from his relentless pursuit of divinely ordained creativity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;" />
