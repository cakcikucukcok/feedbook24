  <title>A Great Unrecorded History - Wendy Moffat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A REVELATORY LOOK AT THE INTIMATE LIFE OF THE GREAT AUTHOR--AND HOW IT SHAPED HIS MOST BE LOVED WORKS &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;With the posthumous publication of his long-suppressed novel &lt;i&gt;Maurice &lt;/i&gt;in 1970, E. M. Forster came out as a homosexual-- though that revelation made barely a ripple in his literary reputation. As Wendy Moffat persuasively argues in &lt;i&gt;A Great Unrecorded History&lt;/i&gt;, Forster&#39;s homosexuality was the central fact of his life. Between Wilde&#39;s imprisonment and the Stonewall riots, Forster led a long, strange, and imaginative life as a gay man. He preserved a vast archive of his private life--a history of gay experience he believed would find its audience in a &lt;i&gt;happier &lt;/i&gt;time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Great Unrecorded History &lt;/i&gt;is a biography of the heart. Moffat&#39;s decade of detective work--including first-time interviews with Forster&#39;s friends--has resulted in the first book to integrate Forster&#39;s public and private lives. Seeing his life through the lens of his sexuality offers us a radically new view--revealing his astuteness as a social critic, his political bravery, and his prophetic vision of gay intimacy. &lt;i&gt;A Great Unrecorded History &lt;/i&gt;invites us to see Forster-- and modern gay history--from a completely new angle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
