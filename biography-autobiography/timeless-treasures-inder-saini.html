  <title>Timeless Treasures - Inder Saini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To achieve greatness in this life, we need to have a vision, a goal. When we are aware of our ancestors and our cultural heritage, we have a starting point, a real sense of where our lives began. We came to this country by our own will, with a rich culture from India. We struggled but worked hard with endless determination to be financially secure in this new country. We overcame many challenges and obstacles. After forty-four years of living in this wonderful country and  having two generations of our family growing up here,  I now realize  that our children are not fully aware of the vast richness and glorious heritage of our ancestors.
 I believe that my generation is the only living link between our past in India and our future in the United States. It becomes my duty to collect all the information I can so that I can share it with my children. Please join me in this autobiography where I share my lifes struggles, successes, and secrets throughout my personal and financial life. I hope this inspires my children, grandchildren, and future members of our family to dream bigger and achieve great things in their lives." />
