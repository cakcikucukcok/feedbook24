  <title>Alexander Hamilton: Ambivalent Anglophile - Lawrence S. Kaplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Of all of the Founding Fathers of the American republic none, with the possible exception of Thomas Jefferson, has evoked more passions and aroused more controversy than Alexander Hamilton.&lt;p&gt; In this absorbing new biography, eminent historian Lawrence Kaplan examines Hamilton&#39;s conception of America&#39;s role in the world and the foreign policies that followed from his vision. Kaplan looks at how Hamilton acted upon his views in shaping the course of American foreign relations.&lt;p&gt; The author provides a focused, accessible biography of Hamilton and a nuanced assessment of his impact on Federalist Era foreign policy. In the Jefferson-Jackson era Hamilton&#39;s persona as an elitist urban aristocrat condemned him as an enemy of an expanding democratic America-an Anglophile at a time when Great Britain was the major adversary. Such was his reputation as an enemy of the common man that his deep-seated opposition to the institution of slavery won little recognition from northern abolitionists.&lt;p&gt; This book will fascinate readers with its insights into Hamilton and the formative years of the United States of America.&lt;p&gt;" />
