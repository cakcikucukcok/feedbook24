  <title>A Perfect Heart - John Healy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since his first appearance on RTÝ&#39;s The Restaurant in 2002, celebrity maître d&#39; John Healy has entertained both diners and viewers alike with his easy manner and winning charm. Seemingly unflappable and endlessly cheerful, he appears the consummate professional. However, behind the smile, John has spent a lifetime struggling to cope with his own demons; battling addiction and depression before suffering two heart attacks and undergoing a subsequent life-saving transplant. A Perfect Heart is the surprisingly candid story of the real John Healy. In it, the popular TV star opens up about his present health fears, as well as his past traumas, revealing the sexual abuse he suffered as a child and the hidden side of a drug and alcohol-fuelled lifestyle that quickly spiralled out of control. A Perfect Heart charts John&#39;s incredible journey towards a new beginning with warmth, humour and honesty." />
