  <title>My Life in My Own Words - Indian Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When author Indian Summers family moved from Mississippi to New York City, it was as if they fell prey to the fantasies New York City offered, when all along, they were just a poor family with false hopes and sinister secrets rooted deeply in the family history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Life in My Own Words&lt;/i&gt;, Summers narrates a powerful account of her troubling life, of being raised by a mentally ill mother, an absent drug-addicted father, and living among the inconceivable and wicked family secrets. She journeyed through life knocking down every obstacle she encountered, but still was weakened in body, spirit, and mind by her lifes battles. She tells how her faith in God is the only way she survived her world of pain, betrayal, and deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir shares how Summers grew up with nothing but the skin on her back and the hair on her head. My Life in My Own Words shares her great lesson in life: make your best good and your good your best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
