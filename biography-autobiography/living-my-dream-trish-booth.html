  <title>Living My Dream - Trish Booth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A dream that became reality, and a hope to inspire many on earth.
A new beginning. An ordinary human being, a shy and yet caring character. A thoughtful person, someone who rotated her life and transformed it into a peaceful and adventurous one. Trish was just like everyone else, she worked and was a housewife. Trish now has a totally different perspective on life as a whole. She takes on challenges and inspires others along the way. She looks at life with the desire to fulfil and enjoy it; she knows that there is more to lifemore that can be achieved. 
Trish now participates in various voluntary activities, as well as public speaking, as she shares her story and talks about the Schools&#39; International Peace Quilt. 
Trish had a dream. A dream to unite the world in peace and harmony. Trish is essentially living her dream. From the safety of her Guisborough (North Yorkshire) kitchen table an amazing cultural journey woven with passion and determination, spiced with the complexities of our society, unfolds. Trish founded The Schools&#39; International Peace Quilt, uniting schools internationally. Children sent in drawings that were transformed into something sensational, a most brilliant piece of art a quilt, with over 200 countries involved! The quilt now travels throughout the world for all of those children and the rest of the world to see. 
Trish Booth has most certainly caught the eyes of many across the world. Trish has most certainly Lived Her Dream
(William Booth,age 14)." />
