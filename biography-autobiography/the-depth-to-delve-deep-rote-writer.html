  <title>The depth to delve... deep - Rote Writer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The depth to delve... deep is an amazing adventure that starts on a whim when Rote Writer decides to send his manuscript overseas to London England. Not wanting to wait for a reply, he abandons all to knock on the door of the publishing house he sends it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The editor, pushed by Rote&amp;#39;s persistence, reads his life story manuscript. He then lets him know that it&amp;#39;s too eclectic and personal for their footprint. With that done, Rote, after calling a woman who helps would-be travelers with work permits to find work, decides on her input to travel to Balmaha Scotland to hopefully work and to see the sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, he sidesteps any questions with providing a work permit. Though hired it doesn&amp;#39;t end well. It ends in a showdown between the two women he welcomes into his caravan and the owners of the Inn he works at who also own the caravan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there Rote travels to Edinburgh with whatever money he came with and made, running out. He ends up homeless. He finds shelter in a convent for almost two months. Without a work permit he&amp;#39;s unable to get paid from a job he finds as a cleaner at one of the colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He eventually does get paid for work done. Rote uses the money to travel to Ireland. When he comes back he&amp;#39;s broke again and barred from entering the convent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He manages to get to Salisbury where he sleeps in the bushes inside a garbage bag. He begins to beg for change so he can eat but also travel to see the nearby sites like Stonehenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He eventually begs his way to Glastonbury England where he finds three jobs. Two at the Crown Hotel where he convinces the owner he can work his way out of any debt he incurs if he can just stay there and work. And he finds a bartending job at The George Hotel and Pilgrims&amp;#39; Inn. Neither places of work ask to see a work permit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there with the money he makes, Rote travels to France and Amsterdam. Unfortunately the bad habits of being homeless don&amp;#39;t shake off easily. He ends up being kicked out of Europe. Fortunately he makes enough money back in Glastonbury to fly back home and start anew.&lt;/p&gt;" />
