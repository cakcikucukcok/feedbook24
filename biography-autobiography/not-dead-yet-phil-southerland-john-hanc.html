  <title>Not Dead Yet - Phil Southerland, John Hanc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part memoir, part sports adventure, Not Dead Yet tells the inspirational story of Phil Southerland&#39;s battle with Type 1 diabetes and how from diagnosis to sheer determination, Phil Southerland beat all odds and turned his diagnosis and his passion for cycling into a platform.  From leading a Race Across America to now managing a world-class cycling program, his journey on and off the bike is changing the way the world views diabetes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Phil Southerland was seven-months-old, he lost ten pounds in a week, his body was limp and his breathing slowed to what his mother called a &quot;death rattle.&quot; Rushing him to the ER, she was informed that tiny Phil displayed the youngest case of diabetes on record in the world at that time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blindness, kidney failure and death were all predicted for him by age twenty-five. Twenty-nine years later, not only is Phil alive and well but as the founder of Team Type 1, he and his team of championship cyclists -- many of them diabetics--have become health and fitness role models for people the world over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they have taken on some of the most challenging endurance events in the world, including winning the Race Across America--a grueling 3,000-mile endurance competition--twice. Today, Phil continues to lead Team Type 1 as its professional cycling team, among one of the top 30 teams in the world, races toward an invite to the world&#39;s top cycling event, the Tour de France in 2012.  Leading the pack is a serious challenge for any athlete, but for Phil and his teammates, it presents two daily battles: one to stay in razor-sharp race-fit condition, the other, to stay alive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not Dead Yet&lt;/i&gt; is Phil&#39;s powerful story: his account of his relationship with his mother, and how she struggled to keep him alive; growing up quickly in the New-Old South of the 1990s, learning at the tender age of 6 years old how to check his glucose and give himself injections; of how he fulfilled his dream of becoming a professional athlete using his team and the bike as a platform, inspiring thousands of individuals and families around the world who are battling diabetes to not just chase, but catch, their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
