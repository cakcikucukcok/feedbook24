  <title>Jack Doyle - Michael Taub</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&#39;As boxing books go, this is a masterpiece&#39; - Barry McGuigan. Jack Doyle (1913-1978) was a 6ft 5in Irishman with a giant appetite for life. In 1933 he drew 90,000 to London&#39;s White City to see him fight and was making &amp;amp;pound;600 a week on stage as a singer. He was nineteen. By the age of thirty he had earned and squandered a &amp;amp;pound;250,000 fortune (worth millions today). His motto was, &amp;amp;#145;A generous man never went to hell,&#39; and he lived his life like a hellraiser. In his heyday as a heavyweight boxer, singer and playboy, his celebrity rivalled that of the Prince of Wales, and he and his wife - the beautiful Mexican film star and singer Movita, who later married Marlon Brando, - were as popular in the thirties and forties as Olivier and Leigh or Burton and Taylor. This remarkable biography rescues a glittering period of social and boxing history from obscurity and restores Jack and Movita to their rightful place in the showbiz and sporting pantheon. Jack&#39;s ring presence and personality reached back to the days of the Regency Buck. His friendships with the Royal family, his fist-fight with Clark Gable, his life as a film star and gigolo, his throwing of a fight by knocking himself out, and his extraordinary post-war career as an all-in wrestler, are the stuff of legend confirmed here by seven years&#39; exhaustive research, during which Taub tracked down and interviewed the leading players in Jack&#39;s life. Runner-up for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award 1990&lt;/div&gt;" />
