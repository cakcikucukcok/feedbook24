  <title>Through My Eyes - John Paull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through My Eyes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the first of three memoirs, describes Johns childhood in a working class community in SW England, , and its impact on his lifetime work as a teacher of children and teacher of teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John began his career in the &lt;em&gt;swinging 60s&lt;/em&gt;, teaching in Leicestershire, then the leading light in &lt;em&gt;progressive&lt;/em&gt; education. Perceived to be a successful and effective teacher, he quickly moved out of the classroom, joining the Leicestershire Advisory team, with a brief to support the classroom development of &lt;em&gt;hands-on&lt;/em&gt; science activity. Converting an old one-teacher village school, John created Foxton Field Study Center, inviting teachers and students to visit for hands-on activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1960s, his work in the field of science soon came to the notice of American educators, and John was invited to run several science workshops for teachers in various parts of the U.S. In 1970, he joined Professor David Hawkins at CU Boulder, when David opened the &lt;em&gt;Mountain View Center for Environmental Education,&lt;/em&gt; a base for teachers wanting to do more and more &lt;em&gt;hands-on&lt;/em&gt; science with their students.&lt;/p&gt;
