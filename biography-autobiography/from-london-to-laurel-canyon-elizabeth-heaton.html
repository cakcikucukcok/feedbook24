  <title>From London to Laurel Canyon - Elizabeth Heaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a land far, far, away.... and another lifetime really, there was a 
fair maiden, whose beauty was beyond compare.   She was wise
way beyond her years, and matured at a very young age.
There was a &quot; window of opportunity&quot; in the mid-sixties, that she
was mysteriously aware of, and knew instinctively to take advantage
of it before it vanished........ she had her mother&#39;s blessing, as her mother
knew that opportunities rarely came knocking.....
For those few short years, she took full advantage of her youth and stunning
good looks.  Many doors were opened to her, simply because she was
lucky in that respect.  This is her story and the myriad cast of famous characters
who crossed her path from the music, film, and rock and roll heyday" />
