  <title>Lazarus - Katheryn Maddox Haddad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Read this amazing rags-to-riches story. His name is really Lazarus, but everyone calls him Zarus. His wealth is from a discovery of copper in a first-century desert. Everywhere he goes, people try to cheat him through lies, traps, and even murder. How can he maintain his integrity under such conditions?&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
To complicate matters even more, he is a Samaritan who marries a Jewish young lady. Their mutual love of horses is what brings them together. Their mutual love for their two sons even in adulthood keeps them together. Along the way they meet Jesus through Zarus&amp;#39; sister, Istar, famously known as the &amp;quot;woman at the well&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
Events take place in Arabia, Idumea, Palestine, Samaria, China, India, and Persia.&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the story of the Good Samaritan and forty-five years of his life as he also lives through most of Jesus&amp;rsquo; other parables. Zarus endures false imprisonment, a cruel indenturement, a mine collapse, a brutal sandstorm, an earthquake, an epidemic, and kidnapping. What is all the exhilaration and heartache for? What is life all about, especially when it is hard? Why are we here?&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the suspense, romance, and adventure as Zarus and the love of his life, Jewish Devorah, sacrifice, persist, survive, rise and fall then rise one last time. The surprise ending is based on one of Jesus&amp;#39; last parables and will take your breath away.&lt;/p&gt;" />
