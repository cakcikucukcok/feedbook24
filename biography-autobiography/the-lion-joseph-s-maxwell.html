  <title>The Lion - Joseph S. Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Lion is but a chapter in the life of Dr. Maxwell; it was the spark that lit the fire to search the mysteries of Gods kingdom.  If you hold this book and your eyes can discern the black letters on white pages, you have been called.  This book is no accident, and your arrival at this particular time and place is more than you know.  Dare to search Dr. Maxwells account in The Lion, open your heart to the divine nature of all things, and then prepare yourself for the transformation of providence.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endorsements:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lion by Dr. Joseph S. Maxwell may be the spark that lifts you out of spiritual apathy. Remember 1 Peter 5:8: Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.  Many are called but few are chosen, and Gods word will not return to Him void.  Search the tall Sudan grass with Dr. Maxwell and when you hear that still small voice, get on your knees, give thanks, ask the Almighty what is required of you, stand up, clothe yourself with the Lamb of God, and then put your doggone lamp on a table.  Do not delay. It is high time to cast off the hour of darkness and put on the armor of light, for outside the battle is raging.&lt;p&gt;
