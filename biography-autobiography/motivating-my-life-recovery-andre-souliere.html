  <title>Motivating My Life Recovery - Andre Souliere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Andre Souliere grew up in Biddeford Maine in an old farm house that his grandfather had built.  After High School Andre enlisted in the United States Air Force where he met his first wife and together they had two daughters along with a step-daughter.  They were stationed at different assignments in the United States as well as in Germany.  Andre has remarried to the love of his life and they have been blessed with a son, where they now live in Steep Falls Maine enjoying the country life and outdoor activities.  Andre also feels blessed to have five grandchildren who are the joy of everyones life.  Andre enjoys presenting motivational talks and keynotes on safety, life recovery and life success.  After his divorce, Andre fell into deep depression and alcoholism.  During these dark times, Andre lost the will to go deal with the pain.  His book covers his survival from divorce, separation from his children, depression, alcoholism, and suicide, death of a family member and the murder of his first grandson.  The book also covers his motivation to survive, his love of God and the love story that he developed with his wife Joyce.  The story starts with his entering a rehabilitation center and covers the periods up until he re-marries.  This book is meant to illustrate Andres rise from the darkness of hell to where he is today.  Andre would like this book to be a motivational tool for everyone for their life journey and success." />
