TAMARA LEIGH, AUTHOR, &lt;i&gt;LEAVING CAROLINA&lt;/i&gt; AND &lt;i&gt;NOWHERE CAROLINA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; You are invited on a journey. &lt;i&gt;The Queen of Lemonade&lt;/i&gt; provides a rare glimpse into one womans travel through diagnosis and treatment. Told in first person, this narrative uses scripture, humor, and theology to carry the reader along through this personal experience. Difficult subjects are handled with honesty and grace. You will laugh; you will cry; you will smile. &lt;i&gt;The Queen of Lemonade&lt;/i&gt; came by her title honestlyshe earned it!&lt;br&gt; 
PASTOR LEWIS GROCE, AUTHOR, &lt;i&gt;FEAR NOT! A LAYPERSONS SURVIVAL GUIDE TO THEOLOGY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, Kim Ponce said a prayer. She yearned to be closer to God. In &lt;i&gt;The Queen of Lemonade&lt;/i&gt;, Ponce shares her story of how God answered her prayerbut not quite in the way she expected. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From an early age, Kim suffered from failing health. At just four months old, doctors diagnosed her with a heart condition. At six, in 1974, she underwent heart surgery. She recovered, grew up on Long Island in New York, and attended Emerson College in Boston, where she met her husband Michael; they married in 1992 and now have two children. But in 2001, Kim and her family suffered a setback. After attempting to donate blood, she learned she was infected with Hepatitis C. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Through narrative and reprinting of a series of weekly e-mails sent to her family, this memoir describes Kims battle treating the disease with a forty-eight week antiviral therapy. &lt;i&gt;The Queen of Lemonade&lt;/i&gt; also recounts her tremendous personal spiritual journey and the many lessons she learned about the way God works in peoples lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
