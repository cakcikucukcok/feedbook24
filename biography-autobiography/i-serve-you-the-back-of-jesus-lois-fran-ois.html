  <title>I Serve You the Back of Jesus - Lois François</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I Serve You, Back of Jesus is the true story of Lois Franois, a thirty-four-year-old wife and mother of four young children who struggles with lupus, an incurable autoimmune disease experienced by many peopleyet known by fewthat can drastically change a womans life. With a husband who works two jobs in order to compensate for her lack of income, Lois finds it difficult for her family to make ends meet. As if things couldnt get any worse, she is then diagnosed with one health issue after another. This painful journey causes her to truly question God and her purpose for living. As she experiences many sleepless nights, demonic attacks, and near-death experiences, Lois, a woman who is lacking in physical strength, must find her spiritual and emotional strength in God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many who observe Loiss struggles might question the reality of God. Is He as miraculous as He is often depicted? Will God help her overcome lupus or will she succumb to this deadly sickness? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join in her journey through many trying years as she finds the answers to these questions and more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
