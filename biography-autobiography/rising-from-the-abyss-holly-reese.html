  <title>Rising from the Abyss - Holly Reese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Holly Reeses gripping odyssey to the edge of despair and back is one of rare beauty and powerful insight. While she graphically plumbs the raw reality of chronic illness, Ms. Reese ultimately draws redemption and healing from seemingly insurmountable circumstances. Told with keen wit and a self-deprecating humor that captivates the reader, this beautiful tale of survival against the odds is essential for others challenged by devastating ill health. She exemplifies the truth that our greatest weapon against illness lays not in hospitals or laboratories but within ones own inner spirit. This remarkable, triumphant story offers a light in the darkness, and is one I will definitely recommend to patients.&lt;br /&gt;
