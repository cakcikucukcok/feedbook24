  <title>I Am Not Alone - Annette Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Annette Jennings is a native of Washington
D.C., and her story is one of both tragedy and
triumph. Through the most adverse of situations, we
see how life can trap us, in an attempt to keep us
from the grace of God. Few of us have the courage
to look for help, or what avenues are available to us.
Through-out her life, we see that God was and is
truly a miracle worker, and what He did for Annette,
He can and will do for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Few of us will ever experience the life Annette lived for so many years. This
writing is her way of shouting from the mountain tops about the glory of
God. Whoever you are, and whatever your circumstances; God is ready to assist
you. Today Annette is the mother of two children, a daughter Antoinette, and
a son William. She has dedicated her life to God, and was ordained an Elder
in her home church(Newness of Life, Bible Church). Elder Annette Jennings
says to you  no matter what youve done, no matter what youre going
through, God is all you need; all you have to do is ask." />
