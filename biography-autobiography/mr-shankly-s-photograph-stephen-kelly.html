  <title>Mr Shankly’s Photograph - Stephen Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A holiday photograph of a 10 year old lad leaning over the garden fence with the Huddersfield Town manager Bill Shankly is the starting point for an enduring bond. Shankly, the Kop and the Cavern. Was there ever a more thrilling place for any young person than Liverpool in the sixties? Yet is the pull of the city with all its attractions overwhelming enough to defy the boy&#39;s own burgeoning ambitions that seem destined to whisk him away from the team that he loves so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just a tale about football, it&#39;s about life in Liverpool: Anfield, the Beatles, Cup finals, Catholicism, girls, the shipyards and the politics. It&#39;s the story of one young lad&#39;s journey into adulthood, inspired by a man who was to become an icon. You never know how good it is until it&#39;s gone. That was Liverpool in the sixties.&lt;/p&gt;" />
