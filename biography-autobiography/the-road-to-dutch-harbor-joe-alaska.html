  <title>The Road to Dutch Harbor - Joe Alaska</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am used to moving to where an opportunity exists. And, I enjoy a change. Every few years I found myself in a new situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 I left a company in which I had 15 years of experience. I was at the top of my game, making good money in a steady job. But I hated my boss. I took another position which was a gamble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one year I realized I made a mistake. So I quit my job and put my house up for sale, just as the housing market was imploding in Phoenix. Where would I move? No idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a job search in the northwest US, including Alaska. If I sold my house before I got a job, I would move to Reno. I liked the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the last second I got an offer in Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska. Never had been to Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing I knew, I was driving from Phoenix to Fairbanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew this position was truly unique and would take patience on my part,  I had had enough after a few months and quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once again, another offer presented itself.  This time I would move halfway to Russia on The Aleutian Island chain.  To Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly THIS was going to  work out!&lt;/p&gt;" />
