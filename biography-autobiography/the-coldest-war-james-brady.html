  <title>The Coldest War - James Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;America&#39;s &quot;forgotten war&quot; lasted just thirty-seven months, yet 54,246 Americans died in that time -- nearly as many as died in ten years in Vietnam.  On the fiftieth anniversary of this devastating conflict, James Brady tells the story of his life as a young marine lieutenant in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1947, seeking to avoid the draft, nineteen-year-old Jim Brady volunteered for a Marine Corps program that made him a lieutenant in the reserves on the day he graduated college.  He didn&#39;t plan to find himself in command of a rifle platoon three years later facing a real enemy, but that is exactly what happened after the Chinese turned a so-called police action into a war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Coldest War &lt;/i&gt;vividly describes Brady&#39;s rapid education in the realities of war and the pressures of command.  Opportunities for bold offensives sink in the miasma of trench warfare; death comes in fits and starts as too-accurate artillery on both sides seeks out men in their bunkers; constant alertness is crucial for survival, while brutal cold and a seductive silence conspire to lull soldiers into an often fatal stupor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Korean War affected the lives of all Americans, yet is little known beyond the antics of &quot;M*A*S*H.&quot;  Here is the inside story that deserves to be told, and James Brady is a powerful witness to a vital chapter of our history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
