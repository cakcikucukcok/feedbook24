  <title>Nelson - the New Letters - Colin White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Nelson - The New Letters&lt;/I&gt;, edited by Colin White, presents around 500 of the most important letters uncovered during the course of the epic Nelson Letters Project, a five year search of archivesthroughout the world. &lt;BR&gt;  Dating from 1777 and including the earliest extant Nelson letter, this collection shows us both Nelson the officer and Nelson the private man, and, uniquely among the plethora of new Nelson books, it records his life and exploits in his own words.  &lt;BR&gt;  Written in Nelson&#39;s free-flowing and conversational style, these letters introduce a very real and human figurebringing us much closer to an otherwise distant historical hero. Colin White&#39;s accompanying annotations and essays place Nelson&#39;s life and letters in full context. &lt;BR&gt;  So alongside letters to theDuke of Clarence (later King William IV), Prime Minister Addington, and dignitaries like the King and Queen of Naples, covering treaty negotiations, battle orders and campaign plans, we can also readwarm missives to family and friends, informal notes and instructions to colleagues and subordinates and some eloquently passionate letters to Emma Hamilton.  &lt;BR&gt;  Other highlights include Nelson&#39;saccount of the Battle of Copenhagen; detailed orders for the Trafalgar and Nile campaigns; notes of his careful diplomatic negotiations; his network of personal contacts; and his concern with his public image. &lt;BR&gt; In the Maritime Foundation&#39;s 2005 Media Awards, Nelson - The New Letters was short-listed for the Mountbatten Maritime Prize, and Dr White was short-listed for the Desmond Wettern Maritime Media Award.&lt;BR&gt; Dr COLIN WHITE was Director of the Royal Naval Museum. In an extraordinarily busy 2005 he was also Director of Trafalgar 200, guest curator of the acclaimed &lt;I&gt;Nelson and Napoleon&lt;/I&gt; exhibition at the National Maritime Museum, chaired the Official Nelson Commemorations Committee, and gave dozens of talks on Nelson throughout the country and North America. He was also the author of &lt;I&gt;The Nelson Encyclopaedia The Nelson Companion&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;1797: Nelson&#39;s Year of Destiny&lt;/I&gt;." />
