      <meta name="description" content="This heartwarming memoir is about a man whose childhood was besieged with seemingly insurmountable twists and turns. His father died when he was four years old, and his mother died when he turned nine. He and his four siblings were raised by his grandmother, who was the pillar of his life.

The story teaches inspiring lessons about setting goals and working hard to achieve them. Because of the people who came into his life and upon whose shoulders he stood, the author achieved success at every phase of his life journey.
