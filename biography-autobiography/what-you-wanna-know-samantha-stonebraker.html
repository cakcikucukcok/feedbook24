  <title>What You Wanna Know - Samantha Stonebraker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You know him as B-Rok, a front man for the &lt;i&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/i&gt;.  I know him as G.B., a special nickname shared only between the two of us until &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am Brian Littrell&#39;s first love and highschool sweetheart.  Brian and I were best friends for four years. I was with the &lt;i&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/i&gt; from the beginning when they were just about to catch their shooting star.  From signing their record deal to touring across Europe, Brian and I were inseparable.  I saw the ups and downs, and want to share this amazing story with you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what it would be like to date one of the &lt;i&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/i&gt;?  Are there questions you&#39;ve always wanted to know the truth about?  After the lights go down, what are The &lt;i&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/i&gt; really like? I want to share with you some personal stories about the band, and some really fun, never before seen photos of Brian and The &lt;i&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it could happen to me, it could happen to you, and I want you to be prepared.  I&#39;m just a normal girl who was the first love of one of The &lt;i&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/i&gt;.  If you&#39;re going to be the next girlfriend or just want the hottest secrets about The &lt;i&gt;Backstreet Boys&lt;/i&gt;, I think you&#39;ll enjoy &lt;i&gt;What You Wanna Know&lt;/i&gt;.  You&#39;ll definitely feel closer to those boys you love.  Have fun with it, and enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smiles, &lt;br&gt;Samantha&lt;/p&gt;" />
