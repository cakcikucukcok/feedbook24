      <meta name="description" content="THOMAS M. WHALING Attorney at Law
You will r emember Forest Gump&#39;s ability t o turn u p just i n time for the great
events in history. Clyde Childress is not Forest Gump, but instead a driven, disciplined
genius. Clyde Childress is both a Marine Aviation Warrior and business
tycoon with a special gift for turning up just in time for events that made history.
His life has been a thrill a minute and seems to grow more entertaining and exciting
with time. An Outstanding read!
JOE WADEL Colonel, USMCR, ret
FORKS is an excellent book about the life adventures of a highly decorated
Marine Corps o fficer. It candidly depicts difficult circumstances from Clydes
early years that reveal his dreams and expectations; his early passion for flying as
Virginia&#39;s youngest licensed pilot and his distinguished career as a Marine Corps
aviator evident throughout his book. H is account of actual combat experiences
are both captivating and spellbinding events that, few people will ever experience
in a lifetime. It is a true miracle.
TED KOOPMAN, CDR USN, ret
Clyde O Childress, Major, USMC ret. is one of the most remarkable men I have
ever met. He is a true and genuine Patriot who l oves America and has served
gallantly in combat. Clydes patriotism continues with his on-going efforts to help
veterans, especially those who have suffered in action. His story is one of the most
remarkable I have ever read because of his unique ability to overcome obstacles
that stop most people cold. Clyde is an inspiration to everyone who meets him. His
&#39;never give up&#39; attitude and willingness to go out of his way to help anyone proves
that gallantry exists both in and out of combat. Major Childress&#39; candid story also
proves that the American Dream is alive and well, and &quot;Forks&quot; provides the reader
a rare, personal glimpse into the life of a rare individual .
