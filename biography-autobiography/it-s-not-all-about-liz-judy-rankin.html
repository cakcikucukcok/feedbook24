  <title>It’S [Not] All About Liz! - Judy Rankin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is said that cancer reaches far beyond the body it attacks. Liz, the youngest of four siblings, spent the majority of her early years in Victoria and Tasmania. In her thirties, she followed her heart to the coast of New South Wales. By age thirty-nine, she was a wife and mother on the verge of a new life as a theology student. And then she heard the two words no woman ever wants to hear: breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its [Not] All About Liz&lt;/i&gt;! tells the true story of her battle with cancer through her eyesand through those of her family. Liz; her older sister, Judy; her eldest daughter, Clara; and Joe, the family patriarch, each share a unique perspective on how Lizs cancer impacted them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience took her family and friends on a roller-coaster ride of emotion, one that contained moments of heartbreaking darkness but also unexpected light. &lt;/p&gt;" />
