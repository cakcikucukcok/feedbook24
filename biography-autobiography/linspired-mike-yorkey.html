  <title>Linspired - Mike Yorkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Linspired&lt;/EM&gt; reveals the remarkable journey of the ultimate underdog, Jeremy Lin, formerly of the New York Knicks, current superstar point guard of the Houston Rockets, and the first American-born player of Chinese/Taiwanese descent to play in the National Basketball Association.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In spite of being cut by two NBA teams before he signed with the Knicks, Lin always trusted that God had a plan for his life and his talents. In an interview with Mike Yorkey, Lin says, &quot;I&#39;m not exactly sure how it is all going to turn out, but I know for a fact that God has called me to be here now in the NBA.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After weeks of sitting at the end of the bench, a teammate’s injury finally placed Lin on the court. Since then, he has captivated sports fans throughout the world with his tremendous skill and humble response to all the acclaim.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Weighing in on this phenomenon are tennis’s Michael Chang, the first notable Asian-American athlete, Lin’s pastor, Stephen Chen, and Pat Williams, senior vice president of the Orlando Magic. Other features include eight pages of full-color photos and&lt;EM&gt; &lt;/EM&gt;in-depth interviews with Lin himself, as well as an entirely new chapter detailing Jeremy’s move to the Rockets.&lt;/P&gt;" />
