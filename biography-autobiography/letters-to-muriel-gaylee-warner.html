  <title>Letters to Muriel - Gaylee Warner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Six-and-a-half months into her first pregnancy, author Gaylee Warner learned her daughter had a severe birth defect and would not survive long after birth. In Letters to Muriel, Gaylee presents a collection of letters she wrote to her daughter, Muriel, beginning in July of 1974 at the beginning her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir narrates a journey of love and loss, hope and healing, and dreams and sorrow as Gaylee shares her thoughts, feelings, and experiences with her unborn daughter, always communicating how happy she was to be pregnant with her. &lt;em&gt;Letters to Muriel&lt;/em&gt; tells the grief-filled story of how one woman and her husband loved their unborn child unconditionally and how they dealt with her death just thirty hours after her birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a nurse, Gaylee offers a recollection of her journey so others do not feel alone when facing the same challenges with their own children. Although she experienced a deep sorrow, she believes her daughter truly was a gift.&lt;/p&gt;" />
