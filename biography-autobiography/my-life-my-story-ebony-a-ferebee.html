  <title>My Life, My Story - Ebony A. Ferebee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;My Life, My Story&lt;/i&gt; shares the story of Ebony Ferebees challenging life. From the age of eight, she has lived a very different life from others. Throughout her life, she has faced obstacles and challenges that have given her a very different perspective on life. She has dealt with abuse in her home, molestation, the death of a parent, a suicide attempt, her mothers breast cancer diagnosis, an identity crisis, an abusive relationship, and adjustment to becoming a military wife at nineteen.
In &lt;i&gt;My Life, My Story,&lt;/i&gt; she speaks to the little girl who just wants to be loved and to the young lady who wants a better life for herself. She has been able to overcome the challenges the world has thrown at her and live an amazing life despite all the odds against her. These days, she spends quality time with the Lord every day and keeps in touch with her brother, who is now in college. She strives to live up to Gods expectations, and there is no place she would rather be other than exactly where she is in her life. 
Celebrating womanhood and life!" />
