  <title>Shaking Hands with Love - Gina Ravenswood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can you feel the love in the room? Follow it, dear one; you are dying. These words were spoken to Nanette as she passed over to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Ravenswood has lived her life in the pursuit of helping others understand theirs. A medium by calling and trade, she enjoys a complicated relationship with death and what follows. When her dear friend, Nannette, was dying of cancer, Gina was at her side. That night, as Nannette prepared to take her last breath, her friend was there. But this was not the end for these two friends; it was the start of an extraordinary journey they would shareto death and beyond. Gina was awestruck and comforted by the soothing guidance of the angelic presence who came to lead Nannette to her new experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the true story of that remarkable friendship and the profound journey they shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years after her death, Nannette reappeared to Gina, and they enjoyed many colourful conversations. Together, Gina, Nannette, and the spirit guides opened up a new dimension of love and understanding. Nannette was able to share some astonishing insight into what happens after we die, bringing great comfort and peace to the friend she left behind on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youve ever wondered what might happen in the afterlife, &lt;em&gt;Shaking Hands with Love &lt;/em&gt;seeks to provide an answer. Ginas experiences have helped her to face death with great optimism, hope, and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
