  <title>Somewhere over the Rainbow - Patricia Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Story, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, is a human and personal story. Patricia&#39;s Memoir covers much of her life, and of the Twentieth Century, including the Post War Years, seen from a young person&#39;s perspective. This account of her early life is vivid, it will make you laugh, and it will make you cry. The style is conversational, and is all the more credible for it&#39;s lack of exaggeration. This is a straightforward story, well told. It tells of amazing Divine Interventions, of Spiritual Guides, Helpers and Guardian Angels, who have accompanied Patricia through every step of her journey. This book will give hope and comfort to the bereaved, the sick and the lonely. Patricia sadly lost her beloved Husband Ken in October 2009, after a very happy marriage lasting 54 years. This book is almost a poem to Ken. But he has never left her, for there isn no death, as her story will prove. This is a moving memorial to a fine man in Ken, a wonderful Husband, Father, Grandfather and Brother. 
Gratitude is the heart&#39;s memory, and my heart remembers." />
