  <title>Saturday Nights with Daddy at the Opry - Libby Leverett-Crew, Les Leverett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Saturday Nights With Daddy at the Opry&lt;/i&gt; is both the story of growing up with a backstage pass to the entertainment world in Nashville as well as a heartwarming tale of a beautiful father-daughter relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the time she was a baby, Les Leverett, who was the official photographer for the Grand Ole Opry took his daughter, Libby, with him each Saturday evening to witness country music&#39;s greatest entertainers. Sometimes Libby carried his equipment, sometimes she played with the other children of Opry performers, but she was always observing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now some 40 years later, Libby Leverett-Crew touchingly remembers those Saturday nights with Minnie Pearl, Tex Ritter, Grandpa Jones, Roy Acuff, Dolly Parton, Porter Waggoner, Bill Monroe, Flatt and Scruggs, along with a few astronauts, muppets, ballet dancers, actors and actresses, and with Andy Warhol and kd lang thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Saturday Nights with Daddy at the Opry&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of music and family-incredibly well written from one lucky daughter&#39;s perspective. Includes more than 100 photographs by Les Leverett.&lt;/p&gt;" />
