  <title>So, You Want to Be a Medical Doctor, Eh. - Whiskers 24</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This article is written because of my experience during the last eighteen years since 1998 for the benefit of newcomers into the field of medical practice. Maybe you will have an entirely different experience, but knowledge of the potential pitfalls should be an advantage. I will make my rendition as factual as possible based on my experience and provide my point of view for balance or comment. My aim is to assist others in their choice before becoming completely, and irreversibly, involved as the road to success is long and hard. That is not to say that it is not rewarding on the principle of what is put in is closely related to what comes out. During my lifetime, I have had a wealth of pleasant experiences in dealing with my patients and staff, as well as the staff of hospitals at which I have worked. It is only during the last eighteen years that the intrusion of the medical boards and government authorities into my practice have had destructive and devastating effects such that I have not been permitted to practice for a lot of that time." />
