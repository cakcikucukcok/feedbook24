  <title>... Life in a Northern Town - Jack Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life in a Northern Town takes the reader on a trip down Nostalgia Lane and veers off, at times, to move in and out of all its nooks and crannies, creeks and fields, metes and bounds, longitudes and latitudes to discoverand be saturated inthe joy of its peripheral travels. The author lingers for mere minutes at a time before moving on to a continuous tour where the rich textured anecdotes dynamically coat the broad paintings that capture your attention with sometimes poignant and sentimental, but mostly inherently entertaining grains along the way. Another turn, another divergent, but amusing surprise. He presents that box of chocolates with him in a roulette-shaped interior with an inordinate amount of selections that offer a variety of innards and consistencies, a number of them with an extraordinary supply of nuts. All are delectable in their own right. So enjoy them while youre looking around at all that stuff. Intentional is its sectional . . . perfect bathroomreading friendly passages that allow for less commitment and advantage of that variable pace, not to mention a 100 proof shot of delight. PG FamilyFriendly Approved." />
