  <title>A Most Unusual Life - Wes Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE TEN TRUTHS
(BY K.B.)
1.	THE COSMOS, UNIVERSE, OUTER SPACE, ETC. ARE REALLY THE KINGDOM OF GOD. 
2.	 THE GREATEST TRUTH OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS THE GOLDEN RULE. 
3.	EARTHLINGS ARE SOULS  WITH BODIES, NOT BODIES WITH SOULS.
4.	THERE IS LIFE AFTER RELIGION.  IT IS CALLED SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT OR THE REVELATION OF THE SOUL.  IT IS YOUR UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD.
5.	OUR EARTHLY LIFETIME IS JUST ONE OF MANY UNCOUNTABLE LIFETIMES ON DIFFERENT WORLDS THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BRING US TO GOD.  WHEN YOU DIE YOU CAN BE REINCARNATED ON THIS WORLD, GO TO ANOTHER WORLD, GO TO A COUNCIL FOR ADVICE, OR GO TO SCHOOL. 
6.	ALL EARTHLY RELIGIONS ARE MAN-MADE AND ARE BASED ON MYTHOLOGY AND FAITH. 
7.	BY DESIGN, THE WORLD IS ABOUT MONEY, RELIGION IS ABOUT CONTROL, AND SEX IS ABOUT PLEASURE. 
8.	GOD IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS.  HE CARES ONLY ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE, NOT WHAT YOU DO.
9.	THE ONLY JUDGMENTAL SIN ON EARTH IS DELIBERATELY HURTING ANOTHER PERSON OUT OF REVENGE, OR FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GAIN. THIS TRUTH SHOWS THAT THE 10 COMMANDMENTS ARE A MYTH, CREATED BY MOSES TO CONTROL THE HEBREWS.
10.	BE IN THE WORLD, BUT NOT OF THE WORLD. MANY ARE CALLED, BUT FEW ARE CHOSEN." />
