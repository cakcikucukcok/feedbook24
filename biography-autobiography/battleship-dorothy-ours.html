  <title>Battleship - Dorothy Ours</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The moving story of a tough little horse, a gifted boy, and a woman ahead of her time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youngest jockey, the smallest horse, and an unconventional heiress who disliked publicizing herself.  Together, near Liverpool, England, they made a leap of faith on a spring day in 1938: overriding the jockey&#39;s father, trusting the boy and the horse that the British nicknamed the &quot;American pony&quot; to handle a race course that newspapers called &quot;Suicide Lane.&quot;  There, Battleship might become the first American racer to win England&#39;s monumental, century-old Grand National steeplechase.  His rider, Great Britain&#39;s Bruce Hobbs, was only 17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobbs started life with an advantage: his father, Reginald, was a superb professional horseman. But Reg Hobbs also made extreme demands, putting Bruce in situations that horrified the boy&#39;s mother and sometimes terrified the child.  Bruce had to decide just how brave he could stand to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the Atlantic, the enigmatic Marion duPont grew up at the estate now known as James Madison&#39;s Montpelier--the refuge of America&#39;s &quot;Father of the Constitution.&quot;  Rejecting her chance to be a debutante, denied a corporate role because of her gender, Marion chose a pursuit where horses spoke for her.  Taking on the world&#39;s toughest race, she would leave her film star husband, Randolph Scott, a continent away and be pulled beyond her own control.  With its reach from Lindbergh&#39;s transatlantic flight to Cary Grant&#39;s Hollywood, &lt;i&gt;Battleship&lt;/i&gt; is an epic tale of testing your true worth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
