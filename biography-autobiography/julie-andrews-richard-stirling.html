  <title>Julie Andrews - Richard Stirling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Julie Andrews is the last of the great Hollywood musical stars, unequaled by any in her time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Fair Lady,&lt;/i&gt; Julie Andrews had the biggest hit on Broadway. As the title character in &lt;i&gt;Mary Poppins,&lt;/i&gt; she won an Academy Award. And, in 1965, &lt;i&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/i&gt; made her the most famous woman in the world and rescued Twentieth Century Fox from bankruptcy. Three years later, the disastrous &lt;i&gt;Star!&lt;/i&gt; almost put the studio back under, and the leading lady of both films fell as spectacularly as she had risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her film career seemed over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Julie Andrews survived, with what Moss Hart, director of &lt;i&gt;My Fair Lady,&lt;/i&gt; called &quot;that terrible British strength that makes you wonder why they lost India.&quot;  &lt;i&gt;Victor/Victoria,&lt;/i&gt; directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards, reinvented her screen image---but its stage version in 1997 led to the devastating loss of her defining talent, her singing voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against all odds, she has fought back again, with leading roles in &lt;i&gt;The Princess Diaries&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Shrek 2&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; story of bandy-legged little Julia Wells from Walton-on-Thames is even more extraordinary; fresh details of her family background have only recently come to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first completely new biography of Julie Andrews as artist, wife, and mother in over thirty-five years---combining the author&#39;s interviews with the star and his wide-ranging and riveting research. It is a frank but affectionate portrait of an enduring icon of stage and screen, who was made a Dame in the Millenium Honours List.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once dubbed &quot;the last of the really great broads&quot; by Paul Newman, she was the only actress in the 2002 BBC poll The 100 Greatest Britons. But who &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Dame Julie, and who is she now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is her story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
