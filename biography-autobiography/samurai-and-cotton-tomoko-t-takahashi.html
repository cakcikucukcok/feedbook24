  <title>Samurai and Cotton - Tomoko T. Takahashi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a story of two livesthat of a loving father and his headstrong daughterin Japan and America. In the context of these two lives, this memoir takes on a historical journey through the world of the samurai as it transitions into the merchant class, culminating in the aftermath of the daughters decision to pursue her dreams to study in America.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Based on the true stories of seven generations of author Tomoko T. Takahashis family and centered around the life of her father, Kiyoshi, &lt;i&gt;Samurai and Cotton&lt;/i&gt; reveals the struggles and triumphs occurring during tumultuous upheavals in Japanese culture at large and the much more personal trials of a single family. This memoir is filled with vibrant, heartfelt emotion and detail, buoyed by the revealing, authentic letters written by family members. While it focuses on the lifespan and memories of Kiyoshi, this is also the story of Tomoko, who receives indefatigable support from her father first as a headstrong youngster in Japan and later as a determined newcomer to America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
