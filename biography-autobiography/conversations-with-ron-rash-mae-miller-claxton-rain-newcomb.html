  <title>Conversations with Ron Rash - Mae Miller Claxton, Rain Newcomb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the publication of &lt;i&gt;Serena&lt;/i&gt; in 2008 earned him a nomination for the PEN/Faulkner fiction prize, Ron Rash (b. 1953) has gained attention as one of the South&amp;#8217;s finest writers. Rash draws upon his family&amp;#8217;s history in Appalachia, where most members have worked with their hands as farmers or millworkers. In the Grit Lit or Rough South genre, Rash maintains a prominent place as a skilled craftsman and triple threat, publishing four collections of poetry, six short story collections, and six novels. Though best known as an Appalachian writer, Rash&amp;#8217;s reach has grown to extend well beyond Appalachia and the American South, spreading to an international audience.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conversations with Ron Rash&lt;/i&gt; collects twenty-two interviews with the award-winning author and provides a look into Rash&amp;#8217;s writing career from his first collection of short stories, &lt;i&gt;The Night the New Jesus Fell to Earth&lt;/i&gt; in 1994 through his 2015 novel, &lt;i&gt;Above the Waterfall&lt;/i&gt;. The collection includes four interviews from outside the United States, two of which appear in English for the first time. Spanning sixteen years, these interviews demonstrate the disciplined writing process of an expert writer, Rash&amp;#8217;s views of literature on a local and a global scale, his profound respect for the craft of the written word, and his ongoing goal to connect with his readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
