  <title>Beloveds, Forever Together: Letters of Eternal Love - Jennifer Tanabe, Dietrich F. Seidel, Elisabeth M. Seidel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is in the form of letters, written in English by Dietrich Seidel (whose native language is German) and his wife Elisabeth (whose native language is French) during various periods over the course of their four decades of married life when they were separated from each other.   Many are pure love letters, several contain deep spiritual insights, while others include practical matters of concern while their spouse was far away. The final entry is a letter written by Elisabeth to her beloved Dietrich after he transitioned into the next world.  Their love story took them through a wide spectrum of emotions, emotions that are powerfully conveyed in their letters. The reader is invited into this very personal space to experience their hopes and dreams, frustrations and victories, expressed in the unique voices of Dietrich and Elisabeth, beloveds who are forever together in heart." />
