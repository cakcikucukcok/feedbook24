  <title>Tribute to My Hubby - Lindy Mlanjana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A simple platonic love develops into something that outweighs a normal love affair. The story is written at the time when marriages were moving from arranged marriages to a more flexible mode. At the same time, not all marriages began with love affairs, but there was an agreement between the two parties.
Young and innocent, a qualification for marriage at that time, Lindy is approached by Steve, and the rest is history. Critics label the affair incompatible.
The marriage is faced with catfights from all angles.
Endowed with beauty and brains, Lindy draws loads of envy. Traps are set for them to be separated. As is common in people who are loving and trusting, Steve, becomes an easy target.
In warning, him, Lindy would be misconstrued as being jealous and possessive. Communication between the two is hampered, and the marriage is shaky.
The beauty of the story is they overcome the catfights, and, together face the world as one." />
