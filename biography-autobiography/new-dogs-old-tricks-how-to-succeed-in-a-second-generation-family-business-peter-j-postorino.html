  <title>New Dogs, Old Tricks: How to Succeed in a Second Generation Family Business - Peter J. Postorino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you are in a family business or even thinking about it, the best advice is this: throw away most of what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned about traditional management. It simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t work! Family-owned companies are replete with idiosyncrasies and challenges that just aren&amp;rsquo;t faced by conventional organizations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happens when you can&amp;#39;t fire your brother, yet he won&amp;#39;t cooperate with you, or vice versa? How do you motivate employees who see nepotism as a ceiling to their advancement? How do you resist being a &amp;ldquo;credit hog&amp;rdquo; and avoid upstaging your staff? Why is managing your children so fundamentally different from parenting, and how do you leave behind all the &amp;ldquo;baggage&amp;rdquo; from their upbringing? Most importantly, how do you ensure that the pursuit of financial gain doesn&amp;rsquo;t destroy the very family it is intended to support?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book explores these and many other questions faced by anyone who tries to make a living by working with their family. It is at times anecdotal, while at others deeply philosophical, and it attempts to help you negotiate a maze of specific problems associated with such an endeavor and, wherever possible, turn them into advantages for lifelong success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
