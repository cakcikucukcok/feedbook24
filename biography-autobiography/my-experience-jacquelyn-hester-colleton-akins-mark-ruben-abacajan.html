  <title>My Experience - Jacquelyn Hester Colleton-Akins, Mark Ruben Abacajan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the 1950s in Jacksonville, Florida, young African American children were used to go into the segregated public schools to pull down discrimination and open the doors for African Americans. At the age of six years old, Jacquelyn had to fight and work hard to fight discrimination. Her goal was to win equal rights for all African Americans. Eating lunch in the cafeteria at a table by herself, enjoying her foodthen suddenly, she felt a splash on her back and head, messing up her pink blouse. She turned around to see what was going on, and some food hit her in the face. With her struggles against the harsh treatment, unfair laws, and prejudice and racism, she had to fight at a young age for equal rights.

The family went to bed with happy thoughts, thinking about my first day of school tomorrow. I woke up early, ate a big breakfast and put on my new school clothes. My aunt came and picked up my sister and brother and took them to school. My mother took me to school at Oceanway Elementary School. When we arrived at the school, my heart was full of joy because it was time for me to start school for the first time. On my first day at Oceanway Elementary School, my mother took me to the office to register me for the first grade." />
