  <title>Billy the Kid (From Houston-Not Texas) - Bill Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The decade of the fifties may have been the last to allow children to be children. Childhood in the fifties was innocent, happy, and carefree. Author &lt;b&gt;Bill Ramsey&lt;/b&gt; was a child who grew up in that decade. &lt;i&gt;In Billy the Kid (From Houston-Not Texas)&lt;/i&gt; he recalls those times and the townspeople, teachers, and neighbors in Houston, Pennsylvania.&lt;br&gt;
Ramsey and his family lived in a modest home in this small town in western Pennsylvania, where the townspeople helped him to become a man. His adult values and philosophies were shaped by that experience. This biographical memoir recounts the simple existence of children in the fifties, with the pick-up ball games, bike riding, and spontaneous play that today&#39;s children have replaced with television, the Internet and video games. It was a time when families ate meals together and fast food restaurants did not exist. It was a time when everyone knew his neighbors.&lt;br&gt;
The vignettes offered in &lt;i&gt;Billy the Kid&lt;/i&gt; honor the memory of those carefree days and the joys of childhood. Although we can&#39;t return to those years, we can return to a simpler way of life that can be sustained and enjoyed." />
