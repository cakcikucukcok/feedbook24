The portrayal of the author&#39;s idyllic childhood from the innocent perspective of a youth, creates a realistic context tinged with tenderness, pathos, and humor. Most of the reminiscences are presented in a short story format. The stories are supplemented by a useful genealogical appendix outlining the processes the author employed. The appendix also contains several historical essays focusing on the socio-political background of the period as well as an interesting essay on the history and importance of Yiddish in this culture. &lt;/P&gt;
