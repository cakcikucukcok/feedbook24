  <title>I Cried Until I Laughed - B.J. Derton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In January of 2000, at the age of fifty-two, author B.J. Derton underwent a fairly simple surgery to remove fibroids. She came out six hours later without fibroids but with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer stage 3c. A very rare typeaggressive, high grade, with no protocol for treatmentDertons doctors gave her from six months to five years with no forecast on a quality of life during that time. 
In I Cried Until I Laughed, Derton shares her journey, finding humor in the thing that frightened her the most. Upon being released from the hospital, she mapped a wellness plan and tracked her medical tests, blood draws, CT scans, x-rays, and surgeries. Derton became her own health advocate and gave herself the right to have hope. Hope to track, control, and fight with everything she could. 
After a twenty-two-month journey, she was pronounced NED on September 11, 2001. She kept her catheter in for two and half years for a just-in-case moment, and then for a Christmas present to herself, she had it removed in the surgeons office. That day she knew she had made it. With a sense of humor, I Cried Until I Laughed narrates how Derton accepted her positive attitude, her plan, and the self-control to not let cancer define her." />
