  <title>Keep Moving Forward - &quot;General Charles &quot;&quot;Hondo&quot;&quot;&quot; Campbell, Lloyd Byers D. Min., Mary Byers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This excellent book is a beautiful illustration of a life well lived. The life of this exemplary young man was cut short by ruthless, brutal enemies.  I believe every person, especially every American youth, should read these true and inspiring words. Joshua Byers is one of the finest examples of what we need Americans to be.  This writing will bring you to a new level of finding meaning and direction in your life.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel as though I know Josh better and look forward to having conversations with him in Heaven. We all think our children are the most special, but Josh really stood out from the crowd. I love how you have woven Joshs last words into a lesson on life.  It is a tribute to Josh, but yet it is so much more.&lt;br&gt;

National President American Gold Star Mothers, Inc. (2010-2011)&lt;br&gt;  
Molly is the proud Gold Star Mom of Captain Brent Morel, KIA Iraq, 2004.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a friend and West Point classmate of Josh, this book strikes home for me. As a combat veteran and infantry officer, my service in Iraq and Afghanistan was just like his. This book portrays so much about the ideals and sacrifices of a real hero and the struggles of so many of our families at home. Its a true portrayal of life at war, both at home and in combat. Joshs sacrifice will always be honored and I will keep moving forward in his name.&lt;br&gt;
