  <title>My Journey Home to God - Janace Stout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally having graduated her last child, she looked forward to decades of golden years with her husband, while she welcomed grandchildren, traveled and settled into the place where they would retire. But on July 26, 2010, her life changed, irrevocably. Rushed to the hospital for what would later be deemed a seizure, she was initially told she was fine. When it happened again, it was clear that there was something very wrong. After weeks of testing, their worst fears unfolded with the diagnosis of brain cancer. With each new development in her cancer, hope could have dwindled, but she was stronger than ever. In the face of debilitating surgeries and life-altering treatment, she emerged as a fighter.   In the words of Janace Stout, this is her story." />
