  <title>Impacting a Generation, Community, City and Nation - The Joshua Project</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young life. Why do you carry guns and why do you carry the knife? Walking the streets now in your crew, getting stopped by boys in blue. Fighting and crime, thats all you see. Youre not even safe in your own community.
Fighting in school got me kicked out, now Im on the streets dossing about. Getting in trouble and getting in strife finding some things to do with my life. Getting stopped and getting chased, oh my gosh now what a waste
Walking on the streets I get pulled by a car. If you have a life like me you wont go far.  Dave (15)
Hope is rising within a generation I our community here in urban west Bradford. That hope shines out from the pages of this book. It is a hope that is giving young people the drive to achieve their dreams, to battle against circumstance so that they might impact their community, city and nation. The Joshua Project is a community organisation that is helping to welcome in this hope breakthrough by innovating inspirational reponses to the needs that young people in this area present. Dave (who wrote the rap above) has experienced that hope. Daves story is one of the many stories that is briefly spotlighted in this book, but there are many more. These stories have the power to turn your life upside down, they have the power  to bring floods of tears to your eyes. Thats the health warning, now turn to the first page and enjoy." />
