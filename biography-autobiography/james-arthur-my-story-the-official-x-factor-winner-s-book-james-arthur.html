        &lt;p&gt;Introducing James Arthur – the winner of The X Factor 2012!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘I still can’t get my head around being on the UK’s biggest talent search, singing in front of millions of people every week – let alone winning it. This is the story of how my dream became reality.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Before the show, I felt I had no future. I’d been working so hard for so many years, through an endless succession of bands and gigs, that at my lowest point I nearly gave up on my dream. The competition changed everything. I’ve grown so much, both as an artist and as a person, and I hope I’ve finally achieved something that will make my family proud. This is the full story of how I got there – my story, in my words.’&lt;/p&gt;
