  <title>Lucy and the Sky - Vesna Rasic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The continual hurry I have been in from the course of life and meeting with challenges may have been my excuse for not having attained my dreams.
I have achieved much though, through the vigor, activity, and courage that my younger years have presented to me.
I have always withheld a youthful outlook and approach to life. Therefore, I have achieved this beautiful chapter of my life that I write about. You may always be assured that I write with sincerity and affection.
I am persuaded to my sentiments, which is more than I should express perhaps.
Among all individuals, you cannot get more bliss than that of children; take my word for it. The feeling of when children are dependent on you is the feeling that is most right
As the times moved on, I gauged good experience with knowing about all the requirements of caring for children, undertaking parents recommendations and being earnest in ones work. 
It is impossible to be with greater truth and attachment than I am.
The countless surprises were what I enjoyed most in my childcare experiences.
My dear readers, in this, my one first book, I only have time to acquaint you with some of my greatest passions: love and being in love, children, and numerous experiences through my years as a nanny.
When I started to prepare my journal, I was yet to discover what biographers skills I may have needed. It is just like hoping that biographers will have sufficient knowledge of interest in European history to appreciate its full value. For example, Prussia in the eighteenth century and diplomacy.
I was impressed with the importance of children in each family home, the neatness of the childrens rooms, the design of the rooms, book shelves, and the comparisons of choice of books for bookshelves.
I was confident in each of my assignments, as I knew the family would find that is transparent in the nanny, as most can sense the confidence that exudes in a nanny, a professional nanny in every sense, the sparkling personality, the charm, and the security that is described in a nannys personality.
To most my experiences and descriptions of children may be classed as quite ordinary however to those who, like me, were yet to discover about children or yet to have children or yet to assign a nanny, may find it interesting." />
