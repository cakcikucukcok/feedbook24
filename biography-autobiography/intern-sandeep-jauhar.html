  <title>Intern - Sandeep Jauhar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intern &lt;/i&gt;is Sandeep Jauhar&#39;s story of his days and nights in residency at a busy hospital in New York City, a trial that led him to question our every assumption about medical care today. Residency--and especially the first year, called internship--is legendary for its brutality. Working eighty hours or more per week, most new doctors spend their first year asking themselves why they wanted to be doctors in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jauhar&#39;s internship was even more harrowing than most: he switched from physics to medicine in order to follow a more humane calling--only to find that medicine put patients&#39; concerns last. He struggled to find a place among squadrons of cocky residents and doctors. He challenged the practices of the internship in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, attracting the suspicions of the medical bureaucracy. Then, suddenly stricken, he became a patient himself--and came to see that today&#39;s high-tech, high-pressure medicine can be a humane science after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a thriving cardiologist, Jauhar has all the qualities you&#39;d want in your own doctor: expertise, insight, a feel for the human factor, a sense of humor, and a keen awareness of the worries that we all have in common. His beautifully written memoir explains the inner workings of modern medicine with rare candor and insight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
