  <title>Mulligan&#39;s Wake - Dave Mulligan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following the untimely death of his beloved father in the &amp;lsquo;80s (comedy writer/producer, Jim Mulligan), 25-year-old Dave Mulligan abruptly dropped every&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;encumbrance in his life (after being arrested for the Killer Whale Incident), bought a plane ticket around the world, and commenced a tour of bedlam on the other side of the planet in Australia. There were many failures along the way and plenty of sex...but never at the same time. It&amp;rsquo;s really a story of true love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a whirlwind of new faces, beer, honest romance,&amp;nbsp;irresponsible relapses and personal gains, Dave&amp;nbsp;meandered somewhat aimlessly around Australia, driving a discarded station wagon -Ol&amp;rsquo; Creampuff- with a Scotsman named McInnes in the passenger seat. The two formed a unique bond calling themselves the Knights of Chivalry, saving scores of damsels in distress as they traversed the virgin territories Down Under. Along the way, he&amp;rsquo;s regularly visited in his dreams by his late father. Dave believes Jim would have been disappointed in his running away to find himself&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;after his death and his ethereal manifestation doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold back when letting him know. But there&amp;rsquo;s an&amp;nbsp;underlying amusement in his view as Dave was living an adventure the senior Mulligan had only been able to imagine in his neat and industrious 55 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave also makes the acquaintance of the &amp;ldquo;little voice&amp;rdquo; in his head and has conversations with him at various moments and forks in the road. He&amp;rsquo;s an irresponsible little fucker, but he&amp;rsquo;s pretty funny and enjoys tempting Dave into troublesome situations... often times with girls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
