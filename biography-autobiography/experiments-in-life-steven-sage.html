      <meta name="description" content="This story details how Steven Sage went from a middle-class life of privilege to teen delinquency, to the young adult life of a neer-do-well who was working jobs he hated, and to finding himself on the doorstep of community college. With a family and working twenty to thirty hours a week and having decided to better himself morally and educationally, he ultimately obtained a PhD in psychology and a career as a professor. It should be entertaining for most and perhaps inspirational. It shows that with a shift in personal mission, one can make amends for wrongs, recover from setbacks, and still make the most of life." />
