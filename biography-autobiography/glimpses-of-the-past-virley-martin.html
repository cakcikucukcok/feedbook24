  <title>Glimpses of the Past - Virley Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This manuscript is one of kind, nothing has ever
been written like it before, the story begins in 1941
with the first memory I can date and what I remember
and explains why I grew up so completely different
from the majority of other children that I went to
school with. I begin in Petaluma California as a
small boy and continue through the years telling
of the hardships, struggles and sorrows my family
and relatives faced as they worked and camped in
the different orchards on Highway 99 or the 101 and
barely making enough money to feed them and buy
gas to the next job. Then during the winter each
year Dad worked on chicken ranches or such until
the spring when we would start all over again. That
happened until the summer of 1949 when my family
settled in Yountville California and where the
story ends when I joined the Navy at age seventeen
on the 18th of January 1955." />
