  <title>His Brother&#39;s Keeper - Jonathan Weiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stephen Heywood was twenty-nine years old when he learned that he was dying of ALS -- Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease. Almost overnight his older brother, Jamie, turned himself into a genetic engineer in a quixotic race to cure the incurable. &lt;strong&gt;His Brother&#39;s Keeper&lt;/strong&gt; is a powerful account of their story, as they travel together to the edge of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book brings home for all of us the hopes and fears of the new biology. In this dramatic and suspenseful narrative, Jonathan Weiner gives us a remarkable portrait of science and medicine today. We learn about gene therapy, stem cells, brain vaccines, and other novel treatments for such nerve-death diseases as ALS, Alzheimer&#39;s, and Parkinson&#39;s -- diseases that afflict millions, and touch the lives of many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Heywoods&#39; story taught me many things about the nature of healing in the new millennium,&quot; Weiner writes. &quot;They also taught me about what has not changed since the time of the ancients and may never change as long as there are human beings -- about what Lucretius calls &#39;the ever-living wound of love.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more." />
