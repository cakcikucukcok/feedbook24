  <title>When Water Escapes from the Mountains - Enayat Sultani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Water Escapes from the Mountains recounts the life of Enayat Sultani, born in Kart-é-Char, a village within Kabul, Afghanistan. In this autobiography, Sultani recalls the many small details of his boyhood home, his encounters with the Taliban&#39;s brutality, and the events that redirected him from following the local mullah to seeking escape.   Pulled in one direction by a desire to remain with the woman he counted as his life&#39;s love, he sought his freedom by fleeing Afghanistan. He writes, &quot;I was exhausted and covered in mud mixed with blood. I couldn&#39;t go home like that. I was in a bad state. Instead of running home for my life, I ran toward the mountains, a place no one could see me except the rocks and the spring water. There was a big wave of water coming down from the mountains, and I followed the water until I reached the spring. I lay in the spring and washed my face with my clothes. The water cooled the bruises, and I rested my body in the cave, looking at the blue sky and drying myself.&quot;" />
