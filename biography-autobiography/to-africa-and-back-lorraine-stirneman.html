  <title>To Africa and Back - Lorraine Stirneman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was scared to death. I had just told God I would do WHATEVER HE ASKED.  Now I waited to hear what He wanted me to do, and where He wanted me to go.  Would I be able to do what He asked?  Would I like it?  Would I hate it?  Would it be too hard?  Where would He send me?  What if I failed? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All these questions were running through my head, but I knew that once I made a commitment, I would keep it.  Eventually God did unveil His plan.  I was supposed to go to Bible School, then get a degree in Elementary Education, and go to Africa to teach the children of missionaries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This involved language study in Switzerland.  WOW!  That sounded like fun! Join me as I describe what it was like to live in a Swiss Pension, to study French, and  to visit Dr. Francis Schaeffer. While in Europe, I had to go to Paris to get a visa.  I was scared of traveling alone, but read how God provided a traveling companion at the very last minute and gave us a great weekend in Paris. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I was originally scheduled to teach in the Congo, but due to a serious rebellion there, I was sent to the Central African Republic where I taught five students in a little thatched roof schoolhouse.  Between the bats in the attic, the army ants, the red ants, the flying termites, and the huge flying roaches, I slowly began to adjust to African life and actually enjoyed it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A year later I was sent to the Congo.  The rebellion was over (or so we thought) but during our five day trip to my mission station, we were met by rebels with machine guns demanding our truck. As I slept on the floor in a bullet-ridden room with no food or water, I thought to myself that I should be afraid.  But I was calm and peaceful, for in spite of the circumstances, I knew that I was in the center of Gods will, the safest place in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The rest of the book describes the joy of teaching at Rethy Academy, the frustration of learning Swahili, the excitement of village evangelism, the seasons of loneliness, the experience of visiting a Pygmy village, the trials and joys of starting youth camps, and the MANY, MANY lessons that I learned about God and how you can trust Him completely, for what He has planned for your life will be good, acceptable, and perfect, and you cant improve on that!" />
