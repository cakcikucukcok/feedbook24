  <title>The Art of the Impossible: Dave Barrett and the NDP in Power, 1972¿1975 - Geoff Meggs, Rod Mickleburgh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;At his first cabinet meeting Premier Dave Barrett takes off his shoes, leaps onto the leather-inlaid cabinet table and skids the length of the room. &amp;#147;Are we here for a good time or a long time?&amp;#8221; he roars. His answer: a good time, a time of change, action, doing what was needed and right, not what was easy and conventional.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He set the tone for a government that changed the face of the province. During the next three years, he and his team passed more legislation in a shorter time than any government before or since. A university or college student graduating today in BC may have been born years after Barrett&amp;#8217;s defeat, but could attend a Barrett daycare, live on a farm in Barrett&amp;#8217;s Agricultural Land Reserve, be rushed to hospital in a provincial ambulance created by Barrett&amp;#8217;s government and attend college in a community institution founded by his government. The continuing polarization of BC politics also dates back to Barrett&amp;#151;the Fraser Institute and the right-wing economic policies it preaches are as much a legacy of the Barrett years as the ALR.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dave Barrett remains a unique and important figure in BC&amp;#8217;s history, a symbol of how much can be achieved in government and a reminder of how quickly those achievements can be forgotten. This lively and well-researched book is the first in-depth study of this most memorable of BC premiers.&lt;/div&gt;" />
