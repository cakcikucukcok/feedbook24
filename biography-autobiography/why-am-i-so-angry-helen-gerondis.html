  <title>Why Am I so Angry? - Helen Gerondis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is about my search for the truth about what caused or contributed to my life- long weight problem. In spite of my consulting doctors, nutritionists, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, joining Weight Loss organizations and trying numerous diets, nothing had worked.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Because my lecturer in his feedback on one of my assignments in a counselling course said if I spent as much time looking at the Inside Helen- as I had on the outside Helen, The weight may come off and stay off  I did as he suggested by writing this book.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I looked at myself as a Greek Australian baby, schoolgirl, adolescent and adult. I connected with feelings I had previously supressed or repressed. I discovered information about eating disorders and the brain which led me to the confronting but liberating realisation that since childhood I had an undiagnosed Binge Eating Disorder. Later I found this could have been the result of forgott en trauma which had alienated me from myself and other people.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finding the truth and reconciling myself to the past has freed me from eating compulsively. My weight is within the normal BMI range and I weigh less now than I did as a child of eleven.&lt;/P&gt;" />
