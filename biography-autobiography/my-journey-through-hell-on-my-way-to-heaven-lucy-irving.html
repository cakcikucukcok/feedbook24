  <title>My Journey Through Hell on My Way to Heaven - Lucy Irving</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Lucy McEachern Irving and I am a 30 yr old mother of four, but I only have one living to put to bed every night. He is amazing, and I love him more than anyone could ever imagine. My book is about his sister and his brothers that GOD blessed me with and then took them back to heaven to be with him all in the same breath. I was madly in love with their father and shortly after we married he began to physically hurt me and yet I stayed throughout all the fights and two deaths of our children. I did manage to find true happiness but my children have always held me back in some way. Everything in my life surrounded what happened when they died and surrounded the deep unending connection that their father and I had. He had a hold on me that is not healthy in any way. I went through other abuses, and everyone Ive ever loved thought that the way to express their love for me was with violence. After the death of my children I fell into a very dark place and fell into deep addiction with the fault of no one but my own. I had to learn how to deal with my pain sober, and had to relive everything about their deaths all over again because I truly believed I could numb my pain and never deal with it. I managed to find a way to stay sober and after completely losing all faith I began to realize that without that I couldnt go any were. I couldnt get back up without GODs help. I do end up being blessed with the most amazing baby boy and even though it was a fight to get him here to stay with me, I thank GOD for my blessing and dont take it for granted not one second. But after learning how to live without my children s father and learning to be without him, I fell in real love with a wonderful man who supports me and loves me the way love is meant to be. He gave me a child after 5 miscarriages, but even he couldnt protect me from my children s father, and he did come back into my life to destroy me and what I had managed to salvage of my life. Even my new husband isnt perfect and managed to tear me apart in other ways. And to surprise, another death came into my world and destroyed us for so long. We do manage to find each other again, and because of the strength GOD gave me we are now happy and ready to start our lives together allover again with our precious miracle baby. My story is coming in two volumes because there is so much to tell. I want to show people like me that it can get better if you just try. If you give it to GOD it will happen and your dreams can come true. My main goal is to help just one person in this world to see that they are not alone and never will be. I also want to say, IF I CAN MAKE IT
ANYONE CAN!" />
