  <title>Autobiography Keller Paul Madere in Words and Pictures - Keller P. Madere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the living room were gathered my four sisters Elise, Jeanette, Nita, Rosemary, and me (Keller Paul Madere) along with my wife Carolyn and Charles Stalfort, Nitas husband. After a lot of chit chat back and forth reminiscing about old family stories and happenings, Charles (or Chuck as we know him) brought out his tape recorder. Quizzically, he posed this simple question, What can you tell me about Papa? He was referring to our father, Ernest Hubert Madere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With feelings of unified dismay, none of the five of us were able to provide Chuck with any new information about Papa other than what he already knew. Consequently, in order for the children of Carolyn and me, namely Joni, Colin, and Lana, to have some inkling regarding where I lived, what I did, and get a glimpse into my psyche before they were born and then grew up knowing me, this tome will provide some insight. Our children will have historical and genealogical information concerning their ancestry in words, pictures, and other relative and associated odds and ends. Nowadays, family members tend to get scattered hither and yon. Children often get permanently displaced regarding their backgrounds and family records. Items like birth certificates, report cards, names of first and second cousins, aunts, uncles, close friends, associates, and similar pertinent items gets lost in the shuffle as time steadily marches on. Hopefully, this ponderous volume will soothe many misgivings our children may have about who they are, the backgrounds of their ancestors, and precisely where they came from. Amen!&lt;/p&gt;" />
