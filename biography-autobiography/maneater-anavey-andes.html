  <title>Maneater - Anavey Andes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do you go from dreaming about becoming a nun to devouring three young men in one weekend? How do you go from living behind the Iron Curtain, in a country hermetically sealed from the world, to making love on four continents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maneater is a coming-of-age story of one woman who decides to live life on her own terms. Her journey will take you through dilemmas, struggles, and heartache, but it will also walk you through exotic places, such as the Phra Nang cave in Thailand, filled with carved dildos, and the golden palaces, floating markets, and the red-light district of Bangkok. You will take in the view from the shadow of the Christ the Savior statue in Rio de Janeiro. You will feel the heat of New Orleans and walk into a quaint wedding chapel in Lake Tahoe. Her stories will take you back in time to an island at the tip of the Great Lakes, where time stood still, and it will take you on a road trip across Transylvania, right up to Dracula&#39;s Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will walk down the street with Romanian revolutionaries and with the leather-clad men at the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco. You will dance at the Carnival in Rio, and you will join in on the water fight at the Songkran festival in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll also meet the men she encountered along the way: the blond street musician from Vienna; the dimpled bellman from San Francisco; the blue-eyed surfer from Texas; the handsome, tuxedoed bouncer, off spring of Afghani warriors; the green-eyed salsa dancer from San Salvador; and many, many more. And you will fall in love with Moon, her young prince, whose sexual coming-of-age begins where her journey ends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
