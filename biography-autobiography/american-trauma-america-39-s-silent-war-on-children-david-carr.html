  <title>American Trauma: America&#39;s Silent War On Children - David Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Carr heard the stories of what his father endured as a boy: Fists appearing like unexpected rain, kicks in the side, and nails in his skin. But Carr&#39;s father never set a hand on him. The cycle of abuse, however, was not broken: Carr suffered mental and physical abuse from the people that were supposed to protect him. The stories we tell ourselves about our past can be anything we want them to be. In challenging himself to see his life in a new way, Carr realized that the story of his childhood trauma did not consist of what happened to him. Rather, his story was entirely the way he responded to what happened. That realization set the stage for him to embark on a transformative journey-one that began as a terrified child-but ended with him as a mixed martial arts fighter and owner of two international companies. Join Carr as he shares how the lessons he learned inside and outside of the ring have led him to break a cycle of abuse that continues to devastate so many American families." />
