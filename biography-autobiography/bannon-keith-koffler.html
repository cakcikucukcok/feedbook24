  <title>Bannon - Keith Koffler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To understand the Trump White House, you need to understand Steve Bannon: what&#39;s driving him, what his true role is, and what he&#39;s trying to accomplish on behalf of the American middle class.&lt;br/&gt;
White House reporter Keith Koffler penetrates the fog surrounding the mysterious senior White House advisor, tracing Bannon&#39;s wild and distinctly American path to the White House in this first-ever honest biography of the controversial figure. Born to working-class Democrats in Virginia, Bannon has barrelled through the Navy, Harvard, Wall Street, and Hollywood; he is fluent in esoteric philosophies and political theories; and he has diagnosed the problem with today&#39;s America---the rot that has eaten away at working Americans&#39; hopes, opportunities, and freedoms---and developed a winning strategy for taking America back.&lt;br/&gt;
With inside information on Bannon&#39;s current White House projects and his relationships with other figures in the Trump orbit---and with President Trump himself---&lt;i&gt;Bannon: Trump&#39;s Rebel in the White House&lt;/i&gt; is not only a three-dimensional guide to one of the most fascinating figures of modern American history; it&#39;s also a guide to understanding the Trump administration&#39;s plans for our future." />
