  <title>Oh Wretched Sinner - Doris B. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In February 2011, God blessed me by allowing me to publish my first book. It is an autobiography of my life about the challenges of growing from a child to a woman. The title of this book is OH Wretched Sinner by published author Doris B. Hall.
OH Wretched Sinner tells the story of how God has allowed me to share my sins in hope to stop people from making the same mistakes that I have made in the past. By using my life as an example and my book as a resource you can find a better life. You do not have to wander around the mountain for forty years searching for answers that I can provide here in my book.
This is a self-published book by Xlibris Publishing Company.
I was like a maniac driving reckless all the way pass Knoxville, leaving from upper East Tennessee,  going 90 to 100 miles, like a crazy woman all that way to Knoxville speeding, looking for crack, I tell you no lie YALL, GOD were with me, through of all my stupid ness I did this constant every time I used crack, and that was often, it made me want it more and more with the music blasting loud as I could get it, the people riding with me they were crazy to ride with me but they were crazy too, if I had a flat I had no spare, no insurance I could have killed a lot of people the way I were caring on I know it had to be God on my side, because I was very foolish did not know up from down, why God continued to look over me I would never know the only thing that I could say that I prayed I prayed all the time be all drunk up talking to the lord or whoever was listening I were still not the best pray I was just talking to the about myself and I me black. I was playing rushion roulette, with my life and other people life too
