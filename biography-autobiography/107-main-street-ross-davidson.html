  <title>107 Main Street - Ross Davidson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Ross Davidson&#39;s story is based on his precarious life growing up in privation. He shares his daily struggles from indelible memories in the pages of this book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pass by and visit 107 Main Street, where the author was confined to a world of poverty, but accompanied with hope and other people&#39;s kindness and generosity. Nevertheless, the story contains odd twists and turns.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a strange, highly unusual and complex story of a boy born during the Great Depression. Its foundation and running theme begins with the unlikely marriage between a wealthy American and a poor immigrant woman, escaping famine in her native country. After two years of marriage and living with his controlling mother and matriarch of the family and business, Nellie, unable to cope with the prison-like atmosphere, seven months pregnant, left and accepted a room with a friendly family nearby. While his wife and son were destined to a life of poverty, he continued to live in prosperity. Throughout, no child support was ever received, despite court orders.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is the chronology of the haves and have-nots, an encyclopedia of life lessons woven through a small rural American community-a place where a teacher, employers, an iconic hero, two coaches, a mentor, and above all a devoted mother-impacted the life of a young boy. In academics, athletics, student activities and jobs, the boy had good times and bad, but not without periods of anxiety and fear. He learned, however, to use these emotions as stimulants, not deterrents; where discipline, commitment, perseverance and an attitude of never giving up became part of his philosophy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The gravity and sadness of it all were overridden by love, care, support and attitude-the mother who died prematurely, the son who applied the lessons learned to his motivation and maturation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The author and his wife live in the Northeast and have children and grandchildren." />
