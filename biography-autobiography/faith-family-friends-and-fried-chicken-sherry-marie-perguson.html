  <title>Faith, Family, Friends, and Fried Chicken - Sherry-Marie Perguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through tragic loss to triumphant success, for richer or poorer, Sherry-Marie Perguson was advised for years to write her story. Now, in a style of storytelling that Sherry laughingly describes as Erma Bombeck meets Joel Osteen, and they have dinner together, comes her memoir, which circles around four instrumental influences in her existence: &lt;em&gt;Faith, Family, Friends, and Fried Chicken&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the 50s Sherry-Marie became a talented songwriter and musician, writing over 70 songs and recording three albums, one of which was with her siblings. Unintentionally, she put her writing on hold while blessed to raise her family. She became a successful entrepreneur as the owner of Sherrys Southern Charm &amp; Tea, a famous tearoom and antique shop. Related to such influential figures as Mary Todd Lincoln and George Clooney, shes also a speaker to womens groups, and an award-winning licensed realtor and antique appraiser, just to name a few of her accomplishments. After retiring in 2014, Sherry decided to embark on the next phase of her life: writing this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From biscuits with chocolate gravy to favorite recipes from her revered Tea Room, readers can indulge not only in dozens of treasured family recipes from Sherrys Southern roots, but also in a heartwarming and sincere expression of American family life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Faith, Family, Friends, and Fried Chicken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherry shares a unique heritage we must cherish and perpetuate. Concern for others is a Godly virtue often reflected in her writing, family, and profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Carr, retired Estate Gift Planning Director, Banner Health Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known Sherry for over 20 years, and she is the most reliable, trustworthy, and innovative person that I have known or worked with in my military and business career, which has spanned more than 50 years. I am confident her book will be well received by any who read it.&lt;/p&gt;
