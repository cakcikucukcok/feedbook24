&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;-- I had no way to know that my
beloved bosses were active members of the infamous &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Rosenberg&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;
ring. I learned this much &lt;span class=GramE&gt;later, --&lt;/span&gt; two years after my
immigration to the States. I also learned then that in my ignorance I was in a
good company with the FBI that wanted Joel Barr (a.k.a. Joe Berg) and Alfred &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;Sarant&lt;/span&gt; (a.k.a. Phil &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Staros&lt;/span&gt;) since
the late 1940s, but had no idea forty years later where these people were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The letter was delivered to &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;Shuysky&lt;/span&gt;, Khrushchevs personal assistant, who -- promised to
put it on Khrushchevs desk the day he comes back from his vacation.
Unfortunately, when Khrushchev came back -- he was no longer the First Secretary
of the Central Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;A young, Jewish-looking man came
out of the Consulate and looked at me. -- Three people surrounded me right away,
and one of them said: Lets go. The last thing I saw was the Americans
frightened face, and then he darted back through the door. -- Another KGB
operative with &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Lyalya&lt;/span&gt; at his side caught up with us.
-- Apparently, KGB had our pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Now I had a chance to --
experience mundane, daily life in the &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;United
  States&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;. I would finally live in the country
where everything was rational, logical, economically justified, and not prone
to any ideological perversions. I would finally not feel like Gulliver in the &lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;Land&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;
 of &lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;Idiots&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, as I characterized my
life in the &lt;st1:place&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/st1:place&gt;, and live among people thinking
and acting like me. I was dead wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
