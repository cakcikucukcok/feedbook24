Snater tells his personal story of his acquired German-Dutch heritage, raised by a single mother during the Great Depression and World War II in the small town of Ackley, in east-central Iowa. Relive your own youthful experiences while enjoying the adventures of the author and his friends. Follow his expanding horizons while attending Drake University and the discouraging realities he encountered in the early stages of his career. But witness his sustained and persistent nature that determined the direction of his life. A good marriage and family life helped in maintaining a wholesome and balanced career. Finally, learn of his challenging and rewarding experiences during his thirty-plus years in the field of education. The book is divided into two parts. Part 1 traces his early years.

His interest in organization and curriculum development will provide food for thought. Finally, he finished a Specialist degree that enabled him to serve as superintendent of schools. He ended his career with the satisfaction of a job well done." />
