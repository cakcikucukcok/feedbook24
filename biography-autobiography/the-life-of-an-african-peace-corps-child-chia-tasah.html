  <title>The Life of an African Peace Corps Child - Chia Tasah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My autobiography recounts my life from 1980 as an African Peace Corps child until I became a US citizen in 2012. I lived a full life as a needy child from a poverty-stricken nuclear family of nine and believe I have something fascinating to share with the world. Despite my pennilessness, I made great strides in my endeavors and thrived. I call myself a Peace Corps child of Africa because American Peace Corps volunteers, with benevolent and philanthropic gestures, encouraged my growth into an authentic adult. Mr. Alan Lakomski whisked me away from my job as bartender and manager of a confidential decadent brothel at Club 185 Njinikom at age fourteen and sent me to secondary school. He returned to the United States when his term expired. Bill Strassberger replaced Dan Hunter and supported my education. Christine Swanson advised me to apply to the master-of-education program in human resource development at the University of Minnesota in 2003. I graduated in 2005 with an MEd and now work as an independent team-building and cultural-diversity consultant at All World Languages and Cultures, Inc., in Kansas City, Missouri." />
