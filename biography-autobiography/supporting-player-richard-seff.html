  <title>Supporting Player - Richard Seff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard Seff has spent 60 years in the theatrical jungle as actor, playwright, librettist, agent, investor and now memoirist. He first acted professionally in 1946 and his last engagement onstage was in 2006. He took a 22 year leave of absence from the stage after a long run on Broadway in support of Claude Rains and on tour with Edward G. Robinson in the prize winning Darkness At Noon. During those 22 years he represented artists in the musical theatre.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He left the talent agency in 1974 at the height of his career to return to the stage. In the 30 years that have followed, hes appeared in some 25 plays, for one of which (Angels Fall)  he won the Carbonell Award for Best Supporting Actor In A Play. Hes been in 7 feature films and over 50 television series, soap operas, TV films and mini-series. He is the author of Paris Is Out! which brightened Broadway in 1970 for 104 performances. The musical Shine! for which he wrote the book, won a National Music Theatre Network Award in 2001 and has been published by Samuel French, Inc. and recorded by Original Cast Records. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hit the dressing rooms with him and discover what goes on backstage, in the wings, and behind closed doors. Learn about theatre investing in the Golden Age, when one could buy a piece of a show in the 
intermission on opening night. Hes got tales to tell! 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Join him on this fun filled odyssey through the decades in shows starring Alan Alda, Ethel Merman, Chita Rivera, Dick Van Dyke, William Hurt, Christopher Reeve, Richard Thomas, Judd Hirsch, Jason Robards, in others directed by Hal Prince and written by John Kander and Fred Ebb. Come on along and listen to   well, you know what.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hes Got Tales to Tell!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Richard Seffs career in the theatre represents active participation as agent, producing associate, librettist, and, ultimately, as a skilled actor  In fact, he was responsible for recommending me to, among others, John Kander and James and William Goldman, to take over the direction of A Family Affair in Philadelphia on its way to Broadway   It turns out hes a fine writer as well, and this chronicle of an unusual and varied life in the theatre makes excellent and valuable reading.
	  Hal Prince
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Oh, what a journey weve had. I thank Richard Seff for helping mold the life that I am still enjoying today. To live it again, through his own words, fills my heart.
	  Chita Rivera
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He is a clever old sausage. Far more interesting to see written from his perspective than from a grander vantage point. Far more revealing and very redolent of the profession and its various joys, tribulations, and humiliations.  Well done!
	  Emma Thompson
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A very interesting look at our business from an angle most people never are aware of, including those who are most visibly involved.
	  Alan Alda
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For years Richard Seff  has been one of the wittiest raconteurs on the Rialto, but a pleasure known only to the cognoscenti. Now he has gone public with a biographical reminiscence brimming with anecdota, insight and intelligence. Bravo!
