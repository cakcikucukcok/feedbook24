  <title>A Journey from 726 Walnut Street - Ramon Noches</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I began this book not as a planned publication but as an in-depth chronicle of my recollections. It is a very raw and largely unedited and every word I personally wrote. Most of my life&#39;s experiences contained in the book cover the years from 1942 to 2001. I did not write it for profit or any notion of self-aggrandizement, but something to pass on to my propensity. In fact, my preference is that sales remain low. It does contain several items of historical note probably not covered in other publications. My reasoning was to convert a very lengthy memo into published form because of a similar effort by my Great Grandfather Marshall George Newman (Son of an Indian Chief) that failed. He composed a very lengthy document about his experiences from 1840s forward. That document passed through many hands and eventually disappeared. I did not want to repeat his experience so I elected to complete it in a book that would probably last for many years. Are there inaccuracies in this book, probably, but very few as I made every effort to be honest, direct, and straightforward in all aspects in developing the final product. Perhaps the biggest issue many would have is how honest I related both the good and bad of my life without the obfuscation we see, read, and hear in everyday life. I know of no other path to take than to be honest and not join in the trampling of the word integrity." />
