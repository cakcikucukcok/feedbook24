  <title>SHRI RAMA RAJYA - Vishwamitra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the past, when Bhagwan Vishnu Avatar came to Dharti, He came alone. But, this time Bhagwan Vishnu as Shri Rama Avatar came together with Lakshmi Mata as Shri Mata Sita, Bhagwan Brahma as Maharaja Bharata, Bhagwan Shiva as Rishi Purohit, Ganesha Deva as Rajkumar Lakshmana, Subramaynan Deva as Rajkumar Shatruguna, Prajapati Daksha Deva as Rishi Vasishtha, Vayu Deva as Hanuman, Surya Deva as Maharaja Ravana, Sarsvati Devi as Maharani Kaushlya, Parvati Mata as Maharani Kaykai, and Dhatri Devi as Maharani Sumitra and other Deva and Devi as Rishi Agastya, Rishi Chaitanya, Rishi Parushrama, Rishi Manu, Rishi Kali Mata and Durga Mata. Shri Rama and His Yugam (team) urged Hindu Jana to recognize the bounds and the values of Brahmi Srishti, Satyanarayan Tantra (doctrine or theory), Rishi Shatrupa Tantra, Rishi Gautama Tantra, Ghanta Vitarana Vakra Tantra, Daksha Deva Tantra, Ganesha Deva Shastra (Kushalta), Kartikeya Deva Shastra (Navikarana), Rishi Vasishtha Tantra, Shri Mata Sita Tantra, Shatruguna Tantra and Samantar Jivan Tantra. Shri Rama and His Yugam (team) came to awaken Hindu Jana to move towards the state of perfection from the state of imperfection. One Jiva at a time, one Samaj at time, one Nagar at a time and one Mahajanapada at a time. Shri Rama challenges Bhagwan Satvishwas of Hindu Jana to accept Bhagwan Mansha (wisdom) to have diversity and distribution of Guna (gifts and skills. Use that Bhagwan Satvishwas to acquire Rajya Yogita. That Rajya Yogita would allow true believers to start moving from the state of imperfections towards the state of perfection. If you truly believe, Bhagwan is the Creator of all and He is all powerful then accept His Wisdom of having diversity of religions and His team&amp;rsquo;s a strong sense of humor in all diversity we see in the Brahmi Bhavana (god&amp;rsquo;s creations). He urges us to have some sense of humor. One of the best way to please Bhagwan is to provide continual training in Kala (skills) and opportunities so that hungry can provide for their own food; thirsty have access to clean water and naked have their own clothes. Shri Rama and His Yugam (team) urge Hindu Jana to acquire Madhukar Swabhava (honey bee mind-set) who look for nectar in flowers and while doing that pollinate these plants to grow; and to avoid Makshika Swabhava (flies mind-set) that zeroes in all that we hold to be dirty and obnoxious. Shri Rama and His Yugam (team) challenge Hindu Jana to grow up to be Shishu Praudha (adult children) of Bhagwan. As Praudha, they will not only take care of themselves but also help Muka (mute), Akantha (voiceless) and Vidhura (helpless). They will provide part of their resources and time to see that Brahmi Bhavana is protected and there is no cruelty against Pashu (animals), Pakshin (birds) and Matsya (fish) and their Vasa Prakritika (natural habitat) is protected. Shri Rama and His Yugam (team) supported Abadha Vyapara Arthavyavastha (free market economy) that protects and enhances Kraya Samartha (purchasing power) of Janta. And accept inequality due diversity and inequality of skills. This means some among us would not be able to take care of themselves; hence need for safety nets and challenge to our generosity. Shri Rama and His Yugam (team) believed in an elected civilian government with limited term dictatorial powers. Their primary roles would be to maintain Dharma (law and order), Samanta (fairness) and act as managers of the public resources; passing new laws and regulations would be their secondary role.&lt;/p&gt;" />
