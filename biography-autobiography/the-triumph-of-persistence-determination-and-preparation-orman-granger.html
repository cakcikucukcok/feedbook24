  <title>The Triumph of Persistence, Determination and Preparation - Orman Granger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today is Fathers Day and our children are planning a get together at
their house. As is usual for this time of day, there was the morning fog
replaced later by a clear sky, bright sunshine and warmth. The expected
high temperature today is 71 degrees Fahrenheit up from this mornings
65 but nowhere near the 91 degrees that thermometers would normally
register on Fathers day when I was a kid. Our children have invited us over
to celebrate, since our oldest son is now a father himself, and as my wife
and I drove over to their duplex, I realized that three generations of my
family will be there and it became clear to me that the time had come for
me to provide them with a biographical accounting that will fill in some
blanks about their paternal roots and give them a clearer understanding
of one half of their cultural heritage. It may have appeared to our children
during their short childhood visits to the ancestral homeland of their
father, that their aunts, uncles and cousins lived differently, and were
apparently not as sophisticated as the people with whom they interacted
in Berkeley. They were too young to appreciate the fact that their aunts
and uncles had successful careers as teachers, master welders, policemen,
grocery chain manager, and personal assistant to the President of their
countrys Senate. They probably judged that their cousins toys were
comparatively primitive viewed against the electronic marvels that they
were accustomed to, nor were they as numerous. Television reception
there was deplorable compared to what they were used to at home, and
the duration of programming was limited, but academically, their young
relatives skills were comparable to their own. On one occasion they
were awed by the ability of a few of their cousins to build a functional
lean-to that fitted into the games they were" />
