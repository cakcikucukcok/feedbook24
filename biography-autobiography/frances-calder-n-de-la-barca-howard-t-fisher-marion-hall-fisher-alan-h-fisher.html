  <title>Frances Calderón De La Barca - Howard T. Fisher, Marion Hall Fisher, Alan H. Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frances Erskine Inglis, daughter of a prominent lawyer and Freemason, was born in Edinburgh in 1804. As the Marquesa de Calder&amp;oacuten de la Barca, she died in Madrid&#39;s Royal Palace in 1882. During her life she was a teacher, legation hostess, and successful author, remembered now for her travel classic &lt;i&gt;Life in Mexico&lt;/i&gt; and semi-fictional &lt;i&gt;The Attach&amp;eacute in Madrid&lt;/i&gt;. But her books tell nothing about the greater part of her far-ranging career, which led through a half-dozen countries in response to bankruptcy, extortion, marriage, diplomacy, and revolution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
For this colorful biography the authors have drawn from many sources, including contemporary memoirs, diaries, and numerous letters by and about Madame Calder&amp;oacuten. Sometimes her trenchant commentary on people and places flared into newspaper controversy. From all that can be discovered about her, she emerges as a person of high abilities, energy, and nerve. In addition to the spirited woman at the center of the story, there are also her extraordinary family and a cast of memorable minor characters." />
