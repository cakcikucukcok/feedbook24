  <title>Growing up in All Saints Village, Antigua - Emily Vanessa Spencer Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended for persons living in Antigua in general but more particularly for those living in All Saints at present and to give some historical background of the All Saints I knew growing up there during the nineteen forties to the late sixties. The vast developments which have taken place on all sides since then have changed the features of the village altogether. It should not be regarded as a complete history of All Saints of the Forties and Sixties, but recollections only, of this Author.  I trust that it will trigger some interest, arouse curiosity to the extent that it will encourage someone to do some research and pick up from where I have left off." />
