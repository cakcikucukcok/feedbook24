  <title>A Brief History of Oversharing - Shawn Hitchins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Musings from a “one-man flash mob” (&lt;i&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedian Shawn Hitchins explores his irreverent nature in this debut collection of essays. Hitchins doesn’t shy away from his failures or celebrate his mild successes — he sacrifices them for an audience’s amusement. He roasts his younger self, the effeminate ginger-haired kid with a competitive streak. The ups and downs of being a sperm donor to a lesbian couple. Then the fiery redhead professes his love for actress Shelley Long, declares his hatred of musical theatre, and recounts a summer spent in Provincetown working as a drag queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is sacred. His first major break-up, how his mother plotted the murder of the family cat, his difficult relationship with his father, becoming an unintentional spokesperson for all redheads, and &lt;del&gt;mandy moore&lt;/del&gt; many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blunt, awkward, emotional, ribald, this anthology of humiliation culminates in a greater understanding of love, work, and family. Like the final scene in a &lt;I&gt;Murder She Wrote&lt;/i&gt; episode, &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Oversharing&lt;/i&gt; promises everyone the A-ha! moment Oprah tells us to experience. Paired with bourbon, Scottish wool, and Humpty Dumpty Party Mix, this journey is best read through a lens of schadenfreude.&lt;/p&gt;" />
