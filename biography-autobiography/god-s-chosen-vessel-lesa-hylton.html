  <title>God’S Chosen Vessel - Lesa Hylton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She talks about the changes faced during pregnancy with her second child and also about after her delivery and her sons various illnesses. Her personal battle with a disease called Kearns Sayre Syndrome is also discussed, as it is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, she talks about the struggles and challenges faced with medical health and mental issues, such as depression, and also her battle with visual impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also talks about the different obstacles faced with mobility while being impaired and about how the King of Kings delivered her out of all these afflictions and illnesses. There is also healing scriptures shared in this book that helped her through, and she mentions encouraging words to those that feel that all hope is lost. Know that there is no failure in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read this book with Gods inspiration, you will be reluctant to put it down because of the intensity and the inspirations in the book for those looking for motivation. You will see the power of God and how He never leaves us or forsake us and, as a result, you will be eager to get ready for the Lords return, if that is your desire to be in His presence. If you are an unbeliever, I beseech you to read this book with an open heart, because there is a message for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
