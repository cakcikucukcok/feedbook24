  <title>Getting up Close and Personal - Dee Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the course of our lives, trials, challenges, and tribulations will
come despite the fact that we do not have a desire for them to manifest.
Most of us would prefer to live a problem-free life. However, life is not
designed that way. We learn valuable lessons from situations and
circumstances that occur. It is left up to us to learn the lesson well and
swiftly move forward to the next one. Genuine, Godly characteristics are
built on some of our experiences in life.
My desire is that you and I experience a richer, more abundant
lifestyle, with Gods help and guidance. I want to inspire and encourage
others to know that we can make it through any adversity. Although at
times, things may seem a bit devastating and perhaps impossible, we
will overcome if we do not give up!
I extend my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to you in advance for
your supportive efforts as readers of this memoir." />
