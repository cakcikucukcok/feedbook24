  <title>Ways of Grace - James Blake, Carol Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Arthur Ashe&amp;#8217;s bestselling memoir &lt;em&gt;Days of Grace&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of positive, uplifting stories of seemingly small acts of grace from across the sports world that have helped to bridge cultural and racial divides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many people of color, James Blake has experienced the effects of racism firsthand&amp;#8212;publicly&amp;#8212;first at the U.S. Open, and then in front of his hotel on a busy Manhattan street, where he was tackled and handcuffed by a police officer in a case of &quot;mistaken identity.&quot; Though rage would have been justified, Blake faced both incidents with dignity and aplomb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ways of Grace&lt;/em&gt; he reflects on his experiences and explores those of other sports stars and public figures who have not only overcome adversity, but have used them to unite rather than divide, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi, a Pakistani Muslim and Amir Hadad, an Israeli Jew, who despite the conflicts of their countries, paired together in the 2002 Wimbledon men&amp;#8217;s doubles draw. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Ali, who transcended racism with a magnetic personality and a breathtaking mastery of boxing that was unparalleled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson Mandela, who spent twenty-seven years in prison for his commitment to social reform, peace, and equality yet never gave up his battle to end apartheid&amp;#8212;a struggle that led to his eventual freedom and his nation&#39;s transition to black majority rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groundbreaking tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was a model of courage, elegance, and poise on the court and off; a gifted player who triumphed in the all-white world of professional tennis, and became one of his generation&#39;s greatest players. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaving together these and other poignant and unforgettable stories, Blake reveals how, through seemingly small acts of grace, we can confront hatred, bigotry, and injustice with virtue&amp;#8212;and use it to propel ourselves to greater heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
