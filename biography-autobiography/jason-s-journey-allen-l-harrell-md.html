  <title>Jason’S  Journey - Allen L. Harrell Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The end of my journey here on earth is presently being played out, but I am not afraid. In my lifetime, I have experienced it alllove, happiness, sorrow, and disappointment. Yet I have never felt alone. First, in my childhood, my parents were always there to love and protect me, and then it was my friends at school. I was abundantly blessed having Anne at my side, my wife and my lifes companion. But even above all this, I have felt the ever presence of God. Ive said and done many things that I regret, but my God is a forgiving god, and in my prayers, I am ever pleading for forgiveness for offending him in any way.
I can only imagine the wonderment of what lies ahead for me. After seeing only a few of the natural wonders of the world, how much more beauty can my eyes behold? For me, heaven would be having my spirit set free to float throughout the universe, seeing the marvels of the world that God created for all mankind. But I can only imagine what heaven is really like. A song set to music by Bart Millard, I Can Only Imagine, says it all:
	I can only imagine what it would be like when I walk by your side.
	I can only imagine what my eyes will see when your face is before me.
   	I can only imagine.
	Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?
	Will I dance for you Jesus, or in awe be still?
	Will I stand in your presence or to my knees will I fall?
	Will I sing hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all? 
       	I can only imagine when that day comes and I find myself standing before you.
       	I can only imagine when all I do is forever, forever worship you. 
       	I can only imagine. I can only imagine." />
