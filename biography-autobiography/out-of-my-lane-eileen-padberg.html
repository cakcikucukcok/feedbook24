  <title>Out of My Lane - Eileen Padberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How does a wildly successful sixty-year-old Republican woman from affluent Orange County, California find herself smack in the middle of the Iraq War?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of 2003&amp;rsquo;s American-led invasion of Iraq, Congress appropriated $18.4 billion US tax dollars for construction and repair of that country&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. Saddam Hussein&amp;rsquo;s flagrant neglect of the nation he&amp;rsquo;d ruled for more than two decades had left the land and its people virtually destitute, while he&amp;rsquo;d built hundreds of palaces to support his gluttonous lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approached by a colleague to draft a plan to ensure that Iraqi women&amp;mdash;who&amp;rsquo;d all but disappeared from public life under Iraq&amp;rsquo;s increasingly gender-oppressive culture&amp;mdash;would be able to play a significant role in the rebuilding of their country, political consultant Eileen Padberg got far more than she&amp;rsquo;d bargained for. She soon found herself on a military C-130 transport bound for Baghdad&amp;rsquo;s Green Zone, tapped to execute the plan in a region where a forty-pound flak jacket and boiled beef at the DFAC would replace Eileen Fisher fashions and BBQ on the patio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, as Padberg would quickly learn, the most formidable obstacle to Iraq&amp;rsquo;s integration of qualified women back into the workforce was not the country itself, but the US government and military.&lt;/p&gt;" />
