  <title>Do You Know Who You Are? - Dr. Grell Ferdinand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Autobiography Of Grell Ferdinand 
God must be given well deserved thanks for protecting and sustaining me throughout my existence. My birth in a small country village in Erin, Trinidad, was a miracle from what I heard. I was told that there were complications, and I was given the name Grell, in deference to a Dr. Grell, who was instrumental in my safe delivery. 
My Christian parents, made great sacrifices to have us educated in a Christian environment. They left Erin and set up home in Maracas Valley, in North Trinidad, where we had the benefit of living near to Christian institutions. 
My first degree, a B.A. (General Hons.) in History and Spanish was earned at University of the West Indies, Trinidad. For my Masters degree, my immediate family emigrated to the U.S.A. and I studied at Florida Atlantic University. I did my Doctorate in Educational Leadership at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. 
I currently teach as I have been doing for most of my adult life, having taught in Trinidad, St Croix, New Jersey, New York and Florida. I did my Chaplaincy training at the International Chaplaincy Association, in south Florida, and also work as an assistant pastor in two different churches. 
My goal is to help spread the gospel through a T.V. ministry. I am seeking the Lord to use me with Divine interventions to help bring relief to the sick, to cast out demons and effect the opening of sight to the blind." />
