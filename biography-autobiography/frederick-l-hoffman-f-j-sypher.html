  <title>Frederick L. Hoffman - F. J. Sypher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is the dramatic, inspiring story of a remarkable man, born in Germany, who achieved greatness and fame in the United States, but who, like many other distinguished persons, undeservedly faded from history.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Torn from a happy childhood, and desperate to leave Germany, he finally arrived here, speaking no English, with $4.76 in his pocket. He found love and success. Before he died, he authored 28 books and nearly 1200 published articles.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book tells of his struggles and how he reached his goals, and was a pioneer in calling attention to new public health issues:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; 	calling attention to the deadliness of asbestos (1918)&lt;/P&gt;
 &lt;P&gt;	 linking cancer and smoking (1915)&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;P&gt; 	proving that silicosis was a real disease that was killing thousands of American workers (1922)&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;P&gt; 	presenting preventive methods for malaria control (1917)&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;P&gt; 	predicting from his thousands of air miles in the 1920s that airplanes would replace trains for long-distance passenger travel, and also the danger that airplanes would become major war machines&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;P&gt; 	founding the American Cancer Society (1913)&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;P&gt; 	helping found the American Lung Association (1904)&lt;/P&gt;" />
