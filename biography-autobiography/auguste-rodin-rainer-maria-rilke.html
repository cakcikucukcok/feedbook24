  <title>Auguste Rodin - Rainer Maria Rilke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Auguste Ren&amp;eacute; Rodin (12 November 1840 &amp;ndash; 17 November 1917) was a French sculptor. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, although he was never accepted into Paris&amp;#39;s foremost school of art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rainer Maria Rilke (4 December 1875 &amp;ndash; 29 December 1926), was a Bohemian-Austrian poet and novelist. He is &amp;quot;widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets&amp;quot;. He wrote both verse and highly lyrical prose.&lt;br /&gt;
Several critics have described Rilke&amp;#39;s work as &amp;quot;mystical&amp;quot;. His writings include one novel, several collections of poetry and several volumes of correspondence in which he invokes images that focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude and anxiety. These themes position him as a transitional figure between traditional and modernist writers.&lt;br /&gt;
