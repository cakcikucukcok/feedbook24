  <title>It’S Official! Growing Old Sucks! - Mike Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;It is just a few years ago that I started to write this book! Its Official! Growing Old Sucks! My intent was simply to appeal to older folks of sixty-five years and older who have let their physical and mental muscles go to hell in a hand basket! However, I have to say at that point in time that I did not have a lot of enthusiasm or intensity for the task, which is why the book remained unfinished!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;However, my life was turned upside down when my wonderful big sister fell victim to Alzheimers, such a devastating illness! My sisters demise brought me to the shocking realization that many older people who, just like my sister, have not bothered to make any effort to maintain some level of physical and/or mental fitness could quite possibly fall victim to the same fate!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;In that instant, I realized that although I could do nothing to help my sister, I felt obligated to do anything in my power to help the Alzheimer Foundation do whatever it could to hopefully find a cure at some point for this devastating illness! What sprang from the realization that I needed to do something was what had been missing for several years! My all-empowering why!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;From that point, that awesome power enabled me to become energized, not only to finish writing this book, but it also empowered me to get my body and my mind into the best physical condition of my life! I now look and feel like a man in my forties! However, what truly inspires me is the fact that I now have a tried-and-tested formula to help other older folks to also get into the best shape of their adult lives!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;Come join my crusade, and follow my lead! Theres plenty more room for you to become energized and to be in the best shape of your adult life too! Just as I have done!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
