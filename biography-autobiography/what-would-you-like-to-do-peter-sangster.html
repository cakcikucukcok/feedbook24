  <title>What Would You Like to Do? - Peter Sangster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book takes the reader through Peters life, the people he has met and the numerous ups and downs he experienced in a way which is humorous, sometimes sad and frequently controversial.
This is not just an autobiography.
Peter talks about the women in his life, his views on management and, as a Christian, his philosophy of life. He uses many quotations which enrich his text and challenges the reader to relate to their own experiences. He documents what life was like not long past, but which in many ways is so different from todays age of hi-tech mobile phones, personal computers and the internet.
His working experience was in the financial services industry (mainly insurance underwriting) and he shows, contrary to popular belief, what a fascinating industry insurance is and not a desk bound routine job.
Peter describes himself as an ordinary, normal and average person and that the world is made up of millions of people just like him who may think that their lives are insignificant in the big picture. Our lives are not insignificant. Peter, by recording his memories and experiences has created a history which future generations can explore and hopefully use so that their lives and the lives of future generations will be better.
Peter concludes by quoting an old friend of his, Andy Ripley who played No. 8 for England and the British Lions at Rugby, and who died in 2010 from prostate cancer:
Dare we hope? We dare.
Can we hope? We can.
Should we hope? We must.
We must, because to do otherwise is to waste the most
precious of gifts, given so freely by God to all of us.
So when we die, it will be with hope and it will be
easy and our hearts will not be broken." />
