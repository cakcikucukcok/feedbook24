  <title>Margaret Thatcher: A Life and Legacy - David Cannadine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Few modern women have had as great a political impact as Margaret Hilda Roberts, the grocer&#39;s daughter from Grantham who, as Margaret Thatcher, became Britain&#39;s first woman prime minister. The longest serving British premier of the twentieth century, Mrs Thatcher has been the subject of both adulation and vilification. In Margaret Thatcher: A Life and Legacy, the leading historian Sir David Cannadine sets Margaret Thatcher in the context of recent British
history.
With elegance, wit, and historical insight, Cannadine charts Mrs Thatcher&#39;s upbringing and influences, her political career and life after politics, the impact of her policies, and her personal reputation and political legacy. The book also features a glossary of key terms, a chronology, a &#39;dramatis personae&#39; of significant figures of the period, and a guide to further reading.
Written by one of our foremost international historians, it is an essential work for anyone interested in the life and work of a towering—and often controversial— figure in modern British history, as well as students, academics, and researchers in the fields of modern history and politics." />
