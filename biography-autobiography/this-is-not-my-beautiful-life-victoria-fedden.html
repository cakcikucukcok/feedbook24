As for the question of how to raise a child when you&#39;ve just discovered that your mother and stepfather have allegedly masterminded a pump-and-dump scheme? She was pretty sure that wasn&#39;t covered in &lt;i&gt;What &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;to Expect When You&#39;re Expectin&lt;/i&gt;g--and she really hoped that Bradford Cohen, the noted criminal defense attorney who famously waived his exemption on &lt;i&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/i&gt;, would prove them innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Is Not My Beautiful Life&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how Victoria lost her parents to prison and nearly lost her mind. No one ever said motherhood would be easy, but as she struggles to change diapers, install car seats, and find the right drop-off line at pre-school--no easy task, when each one is named for a stage in the lifecycle of a f*cking butterfly--she&#39;s also forced to ask herself whether a jump-suit might actually complement her mom&#39;s platinum-blonde extensions and fend off the cast of shady, stranger-than-fiction characters (like the recovering addict who scored a reality show when he started an escort service for women) who populated her parents&#39; world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A real-life &lt;i&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/i&gt; that could only unfold in southern Florida, &lt;i&gt;This Is Not &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Beautiful Life&lt;/i&gt; is a hilariously funny and unexpectedly moving memoir of a just-functional family you&#39;ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
