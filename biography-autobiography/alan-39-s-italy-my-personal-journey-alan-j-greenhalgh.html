  <title>Alan&#39;s Italy: My Personal Journey - Alan J. Greenhalgh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past twenty years I have spent considerable time traveling in Italy. It has been an extraordinary experience filled with great times with many friends. Alan&#39;s Italy, My Personal Journey is the story of my passion for Italy, its culture, history, and people. Each of the first five chapters is named after some of the people who have had the greatest impact on my love for this wonderful country, and the final chapter, named for me, culminates in the most amazing of my twenty adventures. 
     This story focusses on how each of these people have had such an enormous impact on my life. I talk about all of my trips with special emphasis on those events which have shaped my thinking, and driven me to try to find greater meaning in my journeys. After many attempts to put in writing how my passion for Italy has had such a profound effect on my life, (but without much success), the weekly television show I produce and perform, Alan&#39;s Italy, on Woodstock Public Access Television, has given me a special perspective that I lacked. Being given the chance to analyze my life of travel throughout the country focussing on the many topics I have selected to broadcast has given me the unique direction I have always sought.
     Join in this journey to some of the most beautiful places on earth, big cities such as Florence, Venice and Rome, and smaller towns such as Orvieto, Civita di Bagnoregio, and Loro Ciufenna among many others. Meet some of my friends and family, and share some of my most memorable experiences in this amazing land. Alan&#39;s Italy, My Personal Journey is the fulfillment of the dream that I have pursued during my life to put into words my extraordinary passion for my second home, Italy." />
