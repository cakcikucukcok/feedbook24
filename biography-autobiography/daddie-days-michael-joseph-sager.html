  <title>Daddie Days - Michael Joseph Sager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Michael Joseph Sager makes it through the birth of his daughter, Emma Claire, without fainting, but there is a lot more work ahead. Being a father changes every aspect of his life, from the food his baby flings to the level of noise hes expected to endure. How can so many sounds come out of a baby so small?
Michael throws himself into being a father with vigor, and in this funny and inspiring account he delivers a blow-by-blow account of his daughters first year. 
Join this new father as he takes joy in every new thing his daughter does, from smiling to farting; survives without sleep and still manages to function; composes and sings songs for his newborn; and shows off his little girl to everyone wholl take a look.
Relive what it felt like to be a parent for the first time, or get a glimpse of what might lie ahead in your future. The candid and heartwarming stories in &lt;i&gt;Daddie Days&lt;/i&gt; showcase the difficulties and joys of being a parent and express a fathers love for the daughter who has changed his life." />
