  <title>Jason Priestley - Jason Priestley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jason Priestley, star of the iconic hit television series &lt;em&gt;Beverly Hills, 90210&lt;/em&gt; and one of the biggest teen idols of the 1990s, chronicles the highs and lows of his life and career in this charming and honest memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hit Fox show &lt;em&gt;Beverly Hills, 90210&lt;/em&gt; became a cultural touchstone of the 1990s and propelled its young cast to mega-stardom, including Jason Priestley, who played honorable Midwestern transplant Brandon Walsh. Yet despite more than twenty years in and out of the limelight, Priestley has carefully maintained his privacy. In this compelling memoir, the actor, director, and race-car aficionado invites us into his private world for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With humor, sincerity, and charm, Priestley offers little-known details about his life and stories of his nine years in America&amp;#8217;s most famous zip code. He talks candidly about celebrity, marriage, fatherhood, and his passion for car racing. He does not shy away from the devastating lows&amp;#8212;his brief jail sentence for drunk driving and the crash at the Kentucky Speedway that nearly took his life. Priestley shares his innermost thoughts about life as a &amp;#8217;90s icon, and goes beyond the Brandon Walsh squeaky-clean image, revealing the tumultuous events that have shaped him, and where he finds his greatest happiness today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
