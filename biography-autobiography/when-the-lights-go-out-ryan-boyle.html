  <title>When the Lights Go Out - Ryan Boyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In October 2003, I became a victim of traumatic brain injury. Thats when I was hit and dragged by a pickup truck while riding a Big Wheel trike at a friends party. Emergency brain surgery saved my life, but I lost a portion of the back part of my brain. At the age of ten, I had to learn how to breathe, swallow, talk, eat, stand, sit, walkeverything all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is one of the leading causes of disability among children, yet, because of the complexity of the brain, experts still have much to learn about how to treat TBI. In When the Lights Go Out, I describe my therapieswhats worked, what hasnt, and whyand share how I learned to cope with the emotional and psychological challenges. In the process, I have discovered the critical roles that faith in God, love of family, the healing power of friends, and the inherent goodness of people all played in my ability to triumph over overwhelming odds. I have also learned that a horrific accident has given me an amazing gift. When the Lights Go Out is an expression of that gift.&lt;br /&gt;
