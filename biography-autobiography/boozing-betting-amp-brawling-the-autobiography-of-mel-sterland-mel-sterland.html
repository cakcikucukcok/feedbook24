  <title>Boozing, Betting &amp;amp; Brawling: The Autobiography of Mel Sterland - Mel Sterland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Boozing, Betting &amp;amp; Brawling is the autobiography of former footballer, Mel Sterland, who played for Sheffield Wednesday, Glasgow Rangers and Leeds United. He was also capped once by England. The book which is co-authored by Sheffield-based journalist, Nick Johnson, opens with Sterland recounting plans to commit suicide after being forced into premature retirement from playing. Following an indifferent start to his career at Sheffield Wednesday, Sterland made his name as a marauding full-back, playing under high-profile managerial trio Jack Charlton, Howard Wilkinson and Ron Atkinson. He made a big-money move to Glasgow Rangers, where he played under another well-known football personality, Graeme Souness. Despite being at Ibrox for only a brief spell, Sterland is fondly remembered by Rangers fans for scoring the goals which helped the Glasgow giants win the first of a record-equalling nine league titles. Following his transfer to Leeds, where he played alongside the likes of Eric Cantona and Gordon Strachan, Sterland won a First Division championship-winner&amp;amp;#8217;s medal, making him one of only a handful of players to win the league title in both England and Scotland. Sterland&amp;amp;#8217;s story features a heady mix of humour, gambling and punch-ups, and will have widespread appeal to football supporters. In the interests of authenticity, no attempt has been made to smooth off the rough edges, creating an honest, raw account.&lt;/div&gt;" />
