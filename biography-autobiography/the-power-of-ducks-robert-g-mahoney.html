  <title>The Power of Ducks - Robert G. Mahoney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Synopsis of The Power of Ducks
Reaching manhood  in an  African American family during the turbulent 1960s , the author watched his father and brother  challenge the system, only to  be struck down and ruined.  
Choosing a safer path, he stayed in school and was the first in his family to graduate from college.  To fulfill his military obligation he joined the Naval Reserves.    Initially, he adhered to his fathers admonition to do what he was told and keep quiet, but eventually he faced a life defining choice  -  confronted with deplorable living conditions, rampant racism, denial of basic human rights, and an illegal war, should he suppress his core life values  or should he speak out?  
This story is about the actions taken by the author and his fellow sailors, or ducks, that led to the creation of GIs Against Fascism, the first major movement within the Navy in southern California to expand sailors rights  and  challenge the Vietnam War.    Each paid a price for speaking out, but by forming a bond  cemented by courage, determination, and loyalty, they raised the awareness of issues that contributed to a new navy and the end of the Vietnam War." />
