  <title>Just Keep Shooting: My Youth in Manhattan: Memoir of a Midwestern Girl in the 1950s and 1960s - Judy B. McConnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This memoir is a sequel to &lt;em&gt;A Penny A Kiss: Memoir of a Minnesota Girl in the forties and Fifties&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Just Keep Shooting&lt;/em&gt; finds the young girl entering her twenties. Anxious to shake off the past, she strikes out on her own to forge a career in the exciting business mecca that was New York City in the nineteen fifties. Eager, determined, fresh diploma in hand, she arrives to establish a life as an independent woman in a conformist era when young women were expected to marry and reproduce. Caught in the spirit of revolt and change that ignites the sixties, she throws aside convention as she sets out to discover like-minded free spirits and create a life that will satisfy her wanderlust and shape her identity. Her dreams light up the sky, but is she able to follow them through to the Promised Land?&lt;/p&gt;" />
