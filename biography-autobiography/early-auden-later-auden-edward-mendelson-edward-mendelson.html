  <title>Early Auden, Later Auden - Edward Mendelson, Edward Mendelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Presented in one volume for the very first time, and updated with new archival discoveries, &lt;i&gt;Early Auden, Later Auden&lt;/i&gt; reintroduces Edward Mendelson&amp;#8217;s acclaimed, two-part biography of W. H. Auden (1907&amp;#8211;73), one of the greatest literary figures of the twentieth century. This book offers a detailed history and interpretation of Auden&amp;#8217;s oeuvre, spanning the duration of his career from juvenilia to his final works in poetry as well as theatre, film, radio, opera, essays, and lectures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Early Auden, Later Auden&lt;/i&gt; begins with Auden&amp;#8217;s emigration from England to the United States. The book follows the evolution of his thought, offering a comparison of the poet&amp;#8217;s views at various junctures over a lifetime. With penetrating insight, Mendelson examines Auden&amp;#8217;s early ideas, methods, and personal transitions as reflected in poems, manuscripts and private papers. The book then links changes in Auden&amp;#8217;s intellectual, emotional and religious experience with his shifting public role&amp;#8212;showing the depth of his personal struggles with self and with fame, and the means by which these internal conflicts were reflected in his art in later years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring a new preface by the author, &lt;i&gt;Early Auden, Later Auden&lt;/i&gt; is an engaging and timeless work that demonstrates Auden&amp;#8217;s remarkable range and complexity, paying homage to his enduring legacy. &lt;/p&gt;" />
