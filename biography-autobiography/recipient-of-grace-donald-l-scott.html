  <title>Recipient of Grace - Donald L. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scotts Recipient of Grace is as American as apple pie with an African American flavor. His story spans racial segregation in the 1930s to the election of President Barack Obama in the Twenty First Century. He begins his story as a poor black youth in the border state of MO and concludes his incredible journey in Washington, D.C. as the Chief Operating Officer, Library of Congress. In between, Dons journey as a soldier in the US Army is richly told and includes the undercurrent of racial tensions in Vietnam and throughout his efforts to remain competitive for schooling and promotions in his 30 year army career. What appears to be the end of a successful army career as a Brigadier General is the beginning of a Cinderella like post military adventure. His surprise appointment by Maynard Jackson (deceased) as the Chief of Staff, Atlanta City Government, selection and appointment by President Bill Clinton as the founding director of AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps,  and rigorous pursuit by a national search team that won his appointment as the Deputy Librarian help explain the reasons behind the title, Recipient of Grace." />
