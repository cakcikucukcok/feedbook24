  <title>Trunk-Space - Jackie Ricci, Michael “EL Jefe” Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TAKE A TRIP with a psychopath as he seeks revenge on friends and family
who set him up and crossed him once they thought that he would be safely
locked away in prison for a very long time. This book is based on an actual
incident that took place in Atlantic City, New Jersey, back in June 2006. A
very mentally unstable man, who was striving to maintain his sanity, was
placed into a position where he felt forced to defend himself using deadly
force. The woman closest to him sent people after him, to kill him, but they
failed. Protecting himself got him over fifi ve long years in prison. Five years
where a rage grew inside of him every second of each day. Throughout the
incident and the length of the prison sentence, He is crossed by his family,
friends, and the mothers of his children. All of them knew what type of animal
they were dealing with, but they chose to cross him anyway. From the moment
that He is released from prison, He begins seeking revenge on them all. His
goal is not just to kill them. He wants to utterly destroy their lives and the lives
of their loved ones. When someone this determined and demented is released
back into society, with a grudge to settle, absolutely no one is safe; and He will
prove it. Trunk Space is truly the most twisted tale ever told about what could
happen when people mess with the wrong person. Take a journey into the
mind of a lunatic and ride with him as He rights the wrongs that were done to
him. Youll never expect what will happen next because even he is too sick and
demented to know. Have you crossed the line lately with someone who is a
little off? Hopefully not, or these events, or ones like it, could surely happen to
you too. Feel His pain and His victims horror as He exacts his revenge." />
