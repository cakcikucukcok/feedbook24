  <title>Forever and a Day - Buck Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On cold winter days, when youre driving through a heavy snowstorm, looking forward through the windshield, you can hardly see where youre going. But if you look in the rearview mirror, you can see a long way behind you. Life can be like that. On days when its hard to see where youre going, it pays to look at where youve been. In Forever and a Day, author Buck Carson looks back on his life, offering a look at the last ninety-some years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Carson shares the details of his long-lived life, providing information about growing up in Pennsylvania, his love of baseball, being drafted into the Army in 1941, surviving three years of combat in the South Pacific, meeting his wife in Australia, raising a family of four children, and enjoying his retirement years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forever and a Day&lt;/i&gt; narrates the story of a life lived to the fullest, of a man having fun almost every step of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
