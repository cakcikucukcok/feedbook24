  <title>Every Day I&#39;m Hustling - Vivica A. Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vivica A. Fox is a dynamo who has created a lasting career on her own, through sheer, roll-up-your-sleeves DIY hustle.  &lt;i&gt;Every Day I&#39;m Hustling&lt;/i&gt; is a personal book with a message Fox passionately believes in: that you make your own luck, that you never ever wake up in the morning thinking somebody&#39;s going to call you and offer you that part or ask you out on that date that&#39;s going to change your life, that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have to wake up and put on your longest eyelashes and fiercest heels and go out and make your life happen yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress provides start-today strategies for success in business and &quot;been there&quot; lessons in love, buttressed with stories from her early family life all the way through to today. Always honest and &lt;i&gt;always &lt;/i&gt;funny, Fox also tells behind-the-scenes tales from some of her biggest movies -- such as Uma Thurman&#39;s life-changing advice during &lt;i&gt;Kill Bill &lt;/i&gt;and Will Smith&#39;s downtime pep talk on &lt;i&gt;Independence Day&lt;/i&gt;. And she maps out exactly what it took to come back with a role on the smash hit &lt;i&gt;Empire&lt;/i&gt; and her own frisky show on Lifetime, &lt;i&gt;Vivica&#39;s Black Magic&lt;/i&gt;. She also shares her &lt;i&gt;how-is-she-53? &lt;/i&gt;secrets to looking your best, no matter the age on your driver&#39;s license.&lt;/p&gt;" />
