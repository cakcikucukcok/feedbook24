  <title>For the Love of Zachary - Marie Casperson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marie Casperson is the mother of 3 wonderful children.  At the time of this incident their ages were Keith 21, Zachary 17 and Arianne 14.  Her children have an extreme closeness, love and respect for each other and for their mother.  Her children are on top of the world with their lives.  Healthy, popular, smart, lots of friends, good self-esteem, active in sports, very well taken care of by their parents, cars, 4-wheeler, jobs, savings accounts, and life couldnt be any better for the Casperson family.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then one night Zachary went out with 8 of his friends just to have innocent fun driving 4x4 trucks in a pit.  On this night there were about 30 kids riding cycles.  A fight broke out between 24 and 17-year old kids and one boy got angry and ran the crowd with his vehicle.  In one persons rage, little 17-year old Zachary ran for his life, but Zachary wasnt fast enough and he was physically crushed into the back of his friends pickup truck.  As the criminal backed up his vehicle to flee, little Zac fell to the ground and this criminal ran over little Zacharys body a second time without a bit of remorse.  3 weeks later Zacs cousin Nick died in a motor cycle accident while riding with many kids from town in Zacs memory.  This criminal is also responsible for another death.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book is about what this criminal did to a family that had it all.  What he did to a community of children who adored Zachary and Nick.  In a moment of anger this criminal shattered so many lives.  The Caspersons family, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and friends all lost their innocence in just a few seconds.  It tells of a Mothers Love who fought for answers and went up against the justice system and For the Love of Zachary she did not rest until someone heard her cries.  How a criminal, a murderer, had more rights than the Casperson family.  How For the Love of Zachary a community of children helped in this fight.  Some hated each other and did not get along, but For the Love of Zachary they put their differences aside and stood strong.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book was written in Memory of Zachary.  It includes the writings of Zacharys mom in a journal since that horrible phone call on the night Zachary lost his life.  It contains every experience, every heartache, every step that was taken to get through such a nightmare.  It is a compelling story written to let people know how murder affects lives.  It also shows the true meaning of the word LOVE!  It tells of a Mothers Love that searches through books and God to find the answers to heal her hurting heart and as she finds these answers she continues to share them with the children.
