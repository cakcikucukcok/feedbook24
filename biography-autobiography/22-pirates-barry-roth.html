  <title>22 Pirates - Barry Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Members of the PRHS Class of 1959 are the fortunate recipients of something called friendship. For us, it all started when we entered school in Pearl River, New York and became Pearl River Pirates.
The friendships that were formed became stronger as we moved from one grade to another, participated in school activities and celebrated the successes of our class and our classmates. Most certainly, our class is blessed in that those early friendships have remained with us for more than sixty years, seventy for some.
Through the years, our class members have stayed in touch with our teachers; came to one anothers assistance when needed; stopped in to visit classmates when we have traveled; communicated via email, telephone, and text messages; held regular five-year reunions, now two-year reunions, cruises, and picnics; and attended monthly breakfast meetings, along with monthly luncheons and periodic pizza nights. We amaze other classes when we show our strength at award and recognition nights for our class members. This unity exists only because something special exists in our hearts.
Memories of our class hijinks, activities, and successes have helped create a closeness that comes easily. We are always glad to see each other and greet each other with caring hugs and are quick to present a big smile and a kind word. This warm solidarity exists not only because we like each other, but also because of the fact that there is a small group of classmates who have worked hard to plan and carry out the reunions, events and the get-togethers that have kept us in constant touch with one another.
It should be understood that our long-lasting, class-wide friendships did not just happen. We all worked at them. For us, friendship, performance and hard work are the hallmarks of our class. They make us proud." />
