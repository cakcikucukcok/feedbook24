  <title>Struth - David Leggat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bill Struth was one of the most successful, outstanding and charismatic managers in football history. He won an astonishing eighteen league championships, ten Scottish Cups and two League Cups with Rangers, as well as being the visionary behind the building of the magnificent Main Stand at Ibrox, which now bears his name. His career with Rangers spanned an incredible forty-two years, beginning as Rangers trainer in 1914 and only ending when he died in 1956. Now, in Struth, the full story of his remarkable life is revealed for the first time, from his beginnings as a champion runner, to his first days at Rangers and his incredible time as manager from 1920 to 1954. Included too are interviews with some of the legendary stars who he managed, such as Bob McPhail, Tiger Shaw, Willie Waddell and Willie Thornton. And there are fascinating insights into his private life, his wife&#39;s tragic suicide and the personal battles he fought later on. Struth: The Story of an Ibrox Legend is a compelling account of a unique man who kept his private life strictly off limits while living in the full glare of the public eye as one of football&#39;s most successful and revered figures." />
