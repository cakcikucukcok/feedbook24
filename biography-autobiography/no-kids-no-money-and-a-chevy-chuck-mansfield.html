  <title>No Kids, No Money and a Chevy - Chuck Mansfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PRAISE FOR CHUCK MANSFIELDS
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NO KIDS, NO MONEY AND A CHEVY&lt;br&gt;
A Politically Incorrect Memoir&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A New Book by a Former Marine and Vietnam War Veteran
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of Chuck Mansfields No Kids, No Money and a Chevy award-winning novelist and essayist Cynthia Ozick writes, &quot;Chuck Mansfield is a first-rate writer of wit, charm, and passion, who applies a clarifying integrity to whatever subject his fine mind alights on. Having been schooled in excellence, he holds it as his lifelong standard; and he is, besides, an embodiment of everything that is meant by the term American Hero - courtly, brave, generous, and in love with family, faith, and country. To read his memoir is to rejoice in the warm presence of human devotion and intellect.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
New York literary agency executive Jack Scovil calls No Kids, No Money and a Chevy &quot;a fascinating read.&quot; He writes, Mansfield &quot;come(s) through clearly as a very remarkable man who commits to life and the task before him with passion and dedication and integrity. Chaminade (High School)s reaction to the WTC tragedy (indeed the ethos of the whole Chaminade experience) was especially moving, and individual tributes to some of (Mansfields) fellow Marines quite affecting and inspiring. Some of (his) viewpoints and assessments couldnt be more timely; (his) critique of business practices fits right in with what were learning about the frauds at Enron and Global Crossing and (his) judgments of some societal trends are also in keeping with the climate of public opinion that has produced the current successes of OReilly and Buchanan. (His) litany of facts about the Vietnam War deserves to be widely circulated.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Retired English professor and writer Robert P. Meikle writes that &quot;everything in this book is the unfiltered (Mansfield): the impeccable use of language, the meticulous attention to detail, the total recall of dates Some are more successful than others when it comes to taking a really honest look at themselves. The trick is to translate that self-awareness onto the written page. It is that translation that (Mansfield does) so successfully. This is a guy who not only has had a good life, but who APPRECIATES all that he has had in (it), especially when it comes to family and friends. Thats an important distinction for that unknown reader to pick up on.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
New York attorney Paul G. Burns has written, &quot;(Mansfields) work shares a problem common to each and every book that I totally and thoroughly enjoyed reading: it had a last page. an outstanding read!!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rear Admiral Paul T. Gillcrist, USN (Ret.), former Assistant Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air Warfare), aircraft carrier fighter pilot and author, says &quot;I was enormously impressed&quot; The Vietnam Era section in Mansfields book, fully a third of the work, &quot;represents the kind of personal history that needs to be told about all wars but about Vietnam particularly.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to P. Henry Mueller, retired Citigroup executive, author and Marine veteran of World War II, &quot;A page-turner,&quot; No Kids, No Money and a Chevy &quot;is hard to put down. The Vietnam portion is in the excellent style of Micheners Tales of the South Pacific. The character descriptions throughout the book are well done.&quot;  The book is &quot;packed with interest, and (the) politically incorrect views add an important and refreshing edge. Not only that, (Mansfield) present(s) (his) views in an instructive way.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CEO and business owner Donald J. Steinert says, &quot;I was most impressed with the way I am able to relate to your book as a former Marine Vietnam veteran.&quot;
