  <title>Hard Head City - Calvin Kerr Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout my military and civilian careers I have had the opportunities to work in many
diverse occupations and positions. Some of the jobs include: First Sergeant, Army Instructor
(Junior Reserve offi cer Training Corps), High School Basketball Coach, Registered Dental
Hygienist, Real Estate Consultant, Financial Advisor with securities 6 and 63 certifi cations,
Drill Instructor, Calvary Scout, Infantryman, Track Commander, Machine Gunner, Grenadier,
and Rifl eman. Sometimes the aforementioned jobs entailed being placed in many
unpleasant places. The Demilitarized Zone in Korea and the Jungles of Panama are two
places that come to mind However, I must admit that one of my biggest disappointments
occurred when I was released by an Air Force Colonel at the Pentagon and found myself
without a job. I never imagined after at least forty years of service (22 active) with the
Army that I did not even rate an interview. Although, I felt empty at the time without a
job, It turned out to be a blessing because it allotted me the time to fi nish this book. I still
make the sacrifi ce of being away from my family to have a job. Nonetheless, I work out of
another state away from home but at least I have a job to support my family.
Anyway, I thank God for the ability and skills to write this book. the events that took place
in this book are all based on true stories. The short stories you are about to engage in were
witnessed by me (the author) or told to me by the storyteller. Names have been changed
to protect the rights of people actually involved.
I wrote this book in such a manner that my generation can relate to it and our younger
generation may attain historical and geographical knowledge. Intentionally, I wanted to be
as inexplicit as possible so that it may be used as a teaching tool. I apologize if anyone is
offended; however, I am merely describing incidents as seen from my eyes with the use of
references. Resources include the internet, books and people." />
