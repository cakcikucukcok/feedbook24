  <title>No Turning Back - Harriett Engleman Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is the story of one mission school that was established to give the gospel to the Navajo people. Although Native Americans are United States citizens, each tribe has its own language and culture, which has kept them from becoming accepted participants in many English language activities. Our goal was not only to give them the gospel, but also to help them learn English and basic subjects, enabling them to become active citizens in New Mexico and beyond. Most of our eighth grade graduates have finished high school and many have received advanced college degrees.&lt;/p&gt;" />
