  <title>Street Witness with a Testimony - Damekio Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Damekio Gardner&lt;/b&gt; was the girl who had it all: designer clothes, lavish jewelry, fancy cars, and a few streetwise hustlers to provide it all. After dating Miles for a while, her life became a continuous, vicious cycle, dating one thug after another, all of whom wanted to live their lives in the fast lane. Her life was consumed by street drama, destruction, and tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, Damekio struggled against constant animosity, the slandering of her name by jealous women, and constant battles with her lovers. She was beginning to feel she was running out of options. She finally reached her breaking point in response to the death of her sons father; thats when she resolved to seek the guidance of  God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damekio now knows that every experience of her lifethe positive and the negativewas a lesson. Making mistakes and learning from them helped her to become the strong, passionate woman she is today. She now hopes to share her testimony to give hope to others who may be facing the dilemmas she did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
