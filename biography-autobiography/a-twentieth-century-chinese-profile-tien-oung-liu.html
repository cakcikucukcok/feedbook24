  <title>A Twentieth-Century Chinese Profile - Tien Oung Liu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A posthumous family memoir by QinXiao-meng. She wrote this book in 1998, from her acute memories
of her brother-in-law Liu Tien Oung. As a highly-educated woman, Ms. Qin was able to participate in the
intellectual circle which her brother-in-law also belonged, therefore, her insight of his life and character goes
beyond the family, providing a worldly view of a man who was a aspiring student, an enthusiastic intellectual,
a successful businessman, and a generous philanthropist.
Ms. Qin graduated from the former University of Shanghai, and then started a four-decade-long teaching
career. Among her many accomplishments, she was Professor and Vice Chairwoman of the English Department
(1964-1983) of Shanghai International Studies University, and a Visiting Professor/Researcher at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1986-1989). Before she died in 2006, she lived in San Jose, California." />
