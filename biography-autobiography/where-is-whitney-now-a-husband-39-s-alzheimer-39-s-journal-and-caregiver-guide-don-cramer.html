  <title>Where is Whitney now?: A Husband&#39;s Alzheimer&#39;s Journal and Caregiver Guide - Don Cramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where is Whitney Now? &lt;/em&gt;takes the reader through the arduous twelve-year journey of&amp;nbsp; caregiver Don Cramer in his struggle to keep his own life balanced and thriving as he cares for his treasured wife&amp;mdash;as both their lives are slowly erased by the relentless steamroller of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A recent Merrill Lynch survey revealed that Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s is the scariest, most feared of all diseases, by a wide margin. Relentless and incurable, it affects those with the diagnosis and everyone around them. But little has been written about the day-to-day challenges that face the caregiver:&amp;nbsp; the constant vigilance, the need to take on ever-increasing responsibilities, the social and financial pressures, the heartbreaking estrangement, the desperate need for help, plus understanding how to cope with the massive changes they face as a loved one&amp;rsquo;s brain is compromised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where is Whitney Now? &lt;/em&gt;is an intimate, heartfelt, no-holds-barred recounting of the Cramers&amp;rsquo; seemingly charmed lives, and the frightening erosion of the life they had planned.&amp;nbsp; When Whitney slipped unexpectedly beyond Don&amp;rsquo;s ability to manage her care, it required an immediate, gut-wrenching move to the enchanting Colonial hill town of San Miguel de Allende in central Mexico, where he had located a remarkable Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s facility to provide the loving care for Whitney he had thought impossible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happens in San Miguel is compelling, sobering and inspiring. &lt;em&gt;Where is Whitney Now?&lt;/em&gt; interweaves the story of the Cramers&amp;rsquo; first ten years with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s, along with Don&amp;rsquo;s journal entries of Whitney&amp;rsquo;s continuing decline since arriving in Mexico&amp;mdash;the jumble of his emotions, his caretaking strategies, his profound sense of loss and search for his own new place in the world. It is a compelling read; sobering and ultimately transformative.&amp;nbsp; As we watch Whitney slip away, we have a front seat on the unstoppable rollercoaster of escalating demands and attention required to handle a future they could not have imagined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
