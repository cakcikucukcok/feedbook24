  <title>Up in the Cheap Seats - Ron Fassler, Jeff York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this touching and often hilarious theatrical memoir, Ron&lt;br /&gt;
Fassler tells the stories of how over a four-year span,&lt;br /&gt;
between the ages of 12-16, he saw 200 Broadway plays and&lt;br /&gt;
musicals for as little as $1.50 a ticket&amp;mdash;and all from UP IN&lt;br /&gt;
THE CHEAP SEATS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Such landmarks as Company, 1776, The Great White Hope,&lt;br /&gt;
Hair, Follies and Pippin are but a small sampling of the&lt;br /&gt;
original productions Fassler saw, funded entirely from the&lt;br /&gt;
money earned as a Long Island paper boy. His eyewitness&lt;br /&gt;
account to some of the greatest shows and stars of the&lt;br /&gt;
1960s and 70s (with visits backstage to a number of them),&lt;br /&gt;
is furthered by conversing over the past four years with 100&lt;br /&gt;
men and women who were part of this remarkable time.&lt;br /&gt;
Threading his own stories with theirs, the book features&lt;br /&gt;
memories and insights from the likes of Harold Prince,&lt;br /&gt;
Stephen Sondheim, Bette Midler, Sheldon Harnick, James&lt;br /&gt;
Earl Jones, Austin Pendleton, Ken Howard, Hal Linden,&lt;br /&gt;
Stacy Keach, Jane Alexander and Mike Nichols among&lt;br /&gt;
many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With a half-century of theatregoing behind him, and&lt;br /&gt;
dozens of credits over a long career as an actor and writer,&lt;br /&gt;
Ron Fassler invites us to revisit the plays that impacted him&lt;br /&gt;
as a young teenager and future artist. Included are indepth&lt;br /&gt;
studies of the lives and careers of some of&lt;br /&gt;
Broadway&amp;rsquo;s finest actors: Julie Harris, Joseph Maher,&lt;br /&gt;
Maureen Stapleton and John McMartin&amp;mdash;all brought to life&lt;br /&gt;
in vivid detail and sharp observation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
UP IN THE CHEAP SEATS: A HISTORICAL MEMOIR OF&lt;br /&gt;
BROADWAY is a first-of-its-kind hybrid that mixes the&lt;br /&gt;
personal and the professional; a delightful and intimate&lt;br /&gt;
portrait of a time in the theatre that once was &amp;hellip; and will&lt;br /&gt;
never be again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
