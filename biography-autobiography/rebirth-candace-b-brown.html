  <title>Rebirth . . . - Candace B. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While scripting Rebirth.Finding the True You, it occurred to me that rebirth requires a continuous washing of your life from the past. Its not just a onetime thing and youre done. Its a lifetime commitment, you cannot avoid it or throw it into a closet somewhere  out of sight. Procrastination is an evil concept of denial masked as delay; its deceitful, with the intent to destroy your forward and upward movement while forever shackling you to the past filled with hopelessness.
Rebirth is meant to free you, to liberate your life from the darkness and lies of the past, allowing you to find your true self.who you were meant to be, who youve desired to be; to become YOU. 
As believers, Paul admonished Timothy and assured us in 2 Timothy 1:7 (KJV), For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power (might), and love, and of a sound mind (clear thinking). So walk on with courage in your heart, and the soundness of thought, for you are not alone in this pursuit; Hes right beside you. We can get past our past and find our true self." />
