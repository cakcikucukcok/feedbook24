  <title>Jackie Robinson in Quotes - Danny Peary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Fresh Look at an Inspiring Historical Figure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jackie Robinson in Quotes &lt;/i&gt;tells the life story of arguably the most important baseball player in history with over 400 pages of quotations by and about him. Featured are quotes by Robinson, his widow Rachel Robinson, other family members, friends, teammates, coaches, members of the media, and many more. Danny Peary has skillfully curated the best quotes to shed new light on the man behind number 42, who famously became the first black Major League Baseball player in 1947. The quotes speak for themselves, following Robinson through his childhood to his days as a young multi-talented athlete; his famous first meeting with Branch Rickey and signing with the Dodgers; then his exciting Hall-of-Fame career playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Read in his own words how he had to face racism and abuse with stoic silence; and how later the true Robinson emerged--a ballplayer and political activist who refused to stay silent, and who for his whole life remained unswerving in his expectation that all Americans be treated equally, no matter their color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jackie Robinson in Quotes &lt;/i&gt;is a behind-the-headlines narrative about the making and life of a hero. It gives a first-hand account of Jackie Robinson&#39;s baseball stardom, his friendships and rivalries, the people he loved and who loved him, the issues that troubled him, and how he took on all challenges to change the face of America&#39;s favorite pastime, the country itself, and, thus, history forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
