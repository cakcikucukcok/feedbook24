  <title>The Other Side of the Bed: What Patients Go Through and What Doctors Can Learn - Daniel S Mishkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Other Side of the Bed&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is essential reading for caretakers seeking support and solace from someone who has truly been there. When Daniel Mishkin was a medical resident, he received the crash course in patient care he&amp;rsquo;d never hoped for. Overnight, his brother Barry, a brilliant and beloved chief resident with a newborn son, found himself fighting for his life against an aggressive form of leukemia. Rushing from teaching rounds to his brother&amp;rsquo;s bedside, Daniel assumed the unfathomable task of advocating for Barry&amp;rsquo;s care, a responsibility he shouldered from the moment his brother was diagnosed until he passed away more than three years later.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Other Side of the Bed&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chronicles Daniel&amp;rsquo;s experience at his brother Barry&amp;rsquo;s bedside and the lessons he learned there. Through the long journey of chemotherapy, remission, a failed bone marrow transplant, and countless daily tests of morale, Daniel witnessed facets of medicine that can be difficult for doctors to comprehend. Daniel shares his brother&amp;rsquo;s story, recounting anecdotes from his medical career to illustrate crucial principles of patient care. From giving a difficult diagnosis to confronting institutional hierarchy to facing death with dignity, Daniel&amp;rsquo;s story offers insight into the human relationships at the heart of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
