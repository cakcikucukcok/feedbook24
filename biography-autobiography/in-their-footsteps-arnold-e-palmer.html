  <title>In Their Footsteps - Arnold E. Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Their Footsteps is a Genealogical compilation of approximately 900 individuals and the story of how this Palmer Family came to be and where it came from. 
As one might expect, the geography of a complicated genealogy such as this one has several disparate locations of importance. Thankfully, these ancestors chose to cluster around a select few well documented locales: New England, lower New York State, Northeastern New Jersey, Central New York State and the upper Saint John River valley in New Brunswick, Canada. 
It also tells the story of how and why Samuel Benson Leydecker chose exile in the wilderness of New Brunswick over the prospects of staying in the Hackensack River valley of New Jersey after the American Revolution." />
