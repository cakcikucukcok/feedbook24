      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Just Desserts: Martha Stewart: The Unauthorized Biography&lt;/i&gt; comes a scrupulously researched investigative biography that tells the inside story of Anna Wintour&#39;s incredible rise to power&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From her exclusive perch front row center, glamorous &lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt; magazine editor in chief Anna Wintour is the most powerful and influential style-maker in the world. Behind her trademark sunglasses and under the fringe of her Louise Brooks bob she determines whether miniskirts are in or out, whether or not it&#39;s politically correct to wear fur. She influences designers, wholesalers, and retailers globally from Seventh Avenue to the elegant fashionista enclaves of L&#39;Avenue Montaigne and Via della Spiga. In the U.S. alone a more than $200 billion fashion industry can rise or fall on Anna Wintour&#39;s call. And every month millions of women-and men-read &lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt;, and are influenced by the pages of the chic and trendy style wish-book that she has controlled with an iron hand in a not-always-so-velvet glove since fighting her way to the most prestigious job in fashion journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Wintour&#39;s fashion influence extends to celebrities and politicians: because of it, Hillary Clinton underwent a drastic makeover and became the first First Lady to strike a pose on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt; in the midst of Monicagate; Oprah Winfrey was forced to go on a strict diet before Wintour would put her on &lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s cover. And beauties like Rene Zellweger and Nicole Kidman follow Anna Wintour&#39;s fashionista rules to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in her mid-fifties, as she nears her remarkable second decade at the helm of &lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt;, comes this revealing biography that will shock and surprise both Anna&#39;s fans and detractors alike.  Based on scores of interviews, Front Row unveils the Anna Wintour even those closest to her don&#39;t know.  Oppenheimer chronicles this insecure and creative powerhouse&#39;s climb to the top of the bitchy, competitive fashion magazine world, showing up close, as never before exposed, how she artfully crafted and reinvented herself along the way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s been called many things-&quot;Nuclear Wintour,&quot; by the British press, &quot;cold suspicious and autocratic, a vision in skinniness,&quot; by Grace Mirabella, the editor she dethroned at &lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt;, and the &quot;Devil&quot; by those who believe she&#39;s the inspiration for a recent bestselling novel written by a former assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included among the startling revelations in &lt;i&gt;Front Row&lt;/i&gt; are:&lt;br&gt;  *  Anna&#39;s &quot;silver spoon&quot; childhood spent craving time with her father.&lt;br&gt;  *  Anna&#39;s rebellious teen years in London, obsessed with fashion, night-clubbing and dating roguish men.&lt;br&gt;  *  Anna&#39;s many tempestuous romances.&lt;br&gt;  *  Anna&#39;s curious marriage to a brilliant child psychiatrist, her role as a mother, and the shocking scandal that led to divorce when she had an affair with a married man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
