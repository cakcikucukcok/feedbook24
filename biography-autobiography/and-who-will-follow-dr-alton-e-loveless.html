  <title>And Who Will Follow - Dr. Alton E. Loveless</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This heartwarming novel contains the heartbreak
of lost love, conflicts with peers, failure to do what is right and the consequences that come with each decision made. 
It is a story of misplaced values and how God puts a person into situations to fulfill His plan.
In the early 1960s, Lieutenant Allen Livingston
finds his life turned upside-down. Throughout
the next two decades he learns how God can use
others to reveal His purpose to a person wherever
they may be in the world. He learns how life may
have been detoured by heartbreak, but that one
can still find fulfillment and peace when they
return to Gods Will.
The Rasmussens, two Austrian doctors, chose to
leave opportunities for wealth and comfort to give their lives for the poor and homeless in one of the poorest countries in the world. Its in a medical and teaching compound that they give more than fifty years of their life to this humanitarian effort with one thought plaguing them: And Who Will Follow Us?" />
