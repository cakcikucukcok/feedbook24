  <title>Peter O&#39;Toole: The Definitive Biography - Robert Sellers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peter O&#39;Toole was supremely talented, a unique leading man and one of the most charismatic actors of his generation. Described by his friend Richard Burton as &quot;the most original actor to come out of Britain since the war,&quot; O&#39;Toole was also unpredictable, with a dangerous edge he brought to his roles and to his real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of exclusive interviews with colleagues and close friends, Robert Sellers&#39; &lt;i&gt;Peter O&#39;Toole: The Definitive Biography &lt;/i&gt;paints the first complete picture of this complex and much-loved man. The book reveals what drove him to extremes, why he drank to excess for many years and hated authority, but it also describes a man who was fiercely intelligent, with a great sense of humor and huge energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving full weight to his extraordinary career, this is an insightful, funny, and moving tribute to an iconic actor who made a monumental contribution to theater and cinema.&lt;/p&gt;" />
