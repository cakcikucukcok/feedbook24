  <title>From the Farm to the High Seas - Del Strode</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Del Strode knows the value of hard work. At twelve, he took a part-time job on a farm. By fifteen, he decided to drop out of school to work full time. When winter hit, he moved into town and got a job working in a bowling alley. There, a chance meeting with two navy veterans changed his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They encouraged him to apply for a job on their government survey team, and he worked with them for a full year. Although he was encouraged to continue with the surveyors, he wasnt sure that was what he wanted for his life. One week after he turned seventeen, Del walked into a navy recruitment center. One month later, he and his best friend reported for boot camp. Del knew quickly that this was the life he wanted, and he launched himself into the life of a career sailor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years later, he had advanced to master chief. He served on ships ranging from fleet tugs to the worlds largest aircraft carrierin the Atlantic and Pacific oceansworking as a steamfitter, HP welder, radiographer, deep-sea diver, pipe-shop supervisor, and division officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dels story is proof that the only things a person needs to succeed are ambition and hard work. From the Farm to the High Seas is a blueprint for how to achieve success in any field or position, even when starting at an early age, with little education, and no financial support.&lt;/p&gt;" />
