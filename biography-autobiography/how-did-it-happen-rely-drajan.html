  <title>How Did It Happen? - Rely Drajan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;ll begin this &quot;story&quot; of 30 years of work in this field by giving its definition.
In my view, to be a hair stylist represents the manner through Which You Can Express your own understandings about beauty through &quot;playing with hair&quot; - based on the structures being who ... Which you play with!
To work is one of the Necessary human activities have developed to survive or to the satisfaction That you are not making shade on the Earth for nothing and enjoy its effects.
I enjoyed it!
For 30 years I am living the satisfaction of a job well-done.
If someone would ask me what would I do  if I had to start all over again, I think my answer Would be &quot;the same thing&quot;.
Why? Because we, the human Beings are bent upon HAVING A Certain Meaning during our Earthly Lives.
We all come on this world for a well-defined reason, it&#39;s just That Some of us discover it, others don&#39;t! Each with His Own perception.
Any person, looked upon from the outside, has a Certain Way, BUT HIS true face is the one from the inside. Why? Because the most beautiful aspects come from there.
The beauty of the soul is unique Because the soul is part of the divine creation-it&#39;s an undeniable fact! And ... all people are beautiful. You just have to discover Their beauty!
Through my line of work, I am, as a matter of fact, the creator of exterior beauty!
I personalise and harmonise a person&#39;s interior, HIS / HER way of beeing With Their wishes, and place Them on the exterior, and my work result Becomes supreme beauty.
Knowing how to do this is nor easy, neither difficult!
It&#39;s all up to how much you want to and how much you have learned in the field.
The Beginning of my profession, &quot;my golden bracelet&quot; - was like a game. And if you know how to play you never get old...&#39;&#39;" />
