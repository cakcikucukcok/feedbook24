  <title>Road Stories - Peter Aven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Stories always have a lot of names of people and places. I have tried to retain as many original names as I could in the name of realism, but in order to
    protect identities and reputations, and also to followat least halfwaymy lawyers advice, I had to change about half of them. Wherever possible, I simply
    avoided names altogether, as in the bass player or the club owner or the town. Whenever there is a remotely negative connotation the names have most
    definitely been altered. There is also some fill-in work so far as dialogue is concerned. This bit of artistic license was taken not only because I cant
    remember every single thing everyone said, but also in the name of technical dramatic writing. There is a sprinkling of fiction in all storytelling. Think
    of it as the spices in the event-salad. I have tried to keep it to a bare minimum. The only ones who might choke on the pepper are the people who were
    actually there. And you know who you are.
