It is a deliverance of the mind to think freely. It is breaking the chains that have enslaved the mind, body, and soul for several generations. It is telling like it has never been told before. It will enlighten the human intellect in a world filled with madness and in a society that has lied repeatedly that all men are created equally. There is corruption in our society that intertwines and connects to every individual in America. The root cause of this corruption is fueled by the act of greed to gain power, money, and sex." />
