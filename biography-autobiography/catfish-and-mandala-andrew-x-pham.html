  <title>Catfish and Mandala - Andrew X. Pham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Vietnamese Bicycle Days by a stunning new voice in American letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew X. Pham dreamed of becoming a writer. Born in Vietnam and raised in California, he held technical jobs at United Airlines-and always carried a letter of resignation in his briefcase. His father had been a POW of the Vietcong; his family came to America as &quot;boat people.&quot; His sister committed suicide, prompting Andrew to quit his job. He sold all of his possessions and embarked on a year-long bicycle journey that took him through the Mexican desert, where he was treated as a bueno hermano, a &quot;good brother&quot;; around a thousand-mile loop from Narita to Kyoto in Japan; and, after five months and 2,357 miles, to Saigon, where he finds &quot;nothing familiar in the bombed-out darkness.&quot; In Mexico he&#39;s treated kindly as a Vietnamito, though he shouts, &quot;I&#39;m American, Vietnamese American!&quot; In Vietnam, he&#39;s taken for Japanese or Korean by his countrymen, except, of course, by his relatives, who doubt that as a Vietnamese he has the stamina to complete his journey (&quot;Only Westerners can do it&quot;); and in the United States he&#39;s considered anything but American. A vibrant, picaresque memoir written with narrative flair and a wonderful, eye-opening sense of adventure, &lt;i&gt;Catfish and Mandala &lt;/i&gt;is an unforgettable search for cultural identity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
