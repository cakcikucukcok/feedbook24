  <title>A Redneck Kid’S Stories of Refusing to Grow Up - Charles Ray Totty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These roughly chronological stories starting with my earliest memories and continuing to the next eighty years are based on actual activities, including some encounters while coping with aggressive roosters and in-laws. My happy life has been enriched with lessons learned by watching birds, animals, and other humans, even snakes. Life in the piney woods of Alabama prepared me for many adventures encountered in New England, Old England, Korea, Upper Peninsula, south Louisiana, and the Midwest. 
Sadly, many of the people mentioned are now deceased. Some names have been changed to avoid embarrassment. These awesome people have shaped my happy lifestyle, even the policeman that dropped his pad and vamoosed as well as the Tacoma sex-soliciting pervert, not to mention a drafts lady toting a pail of water or the Bentley-craving client.
In the book, you will find a list of reasons I refuse to grow up and a list of a several things eighty years of living have taught me. You might even learn about a titty bream." />
