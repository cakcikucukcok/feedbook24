  <title>An African Story - Uchenwa Iroaga Genus, Dwayne Genus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chinedu was a bright young boy, unfortunately disillusioned by the death of his beloved father. He finds himself spiraling out of control until a visit to his Nigerian grandparents in Toronto puts him on a path to self-realization and changes his life forever. &lt;p&gt;
Chinedus grandmother, Nkechi Iroaga, shares her personal true story of life, love and survival as she escaped the devastation of the Biafran war in the 1960s. Her childhood experiences of growing up in an African village culminate into the journey of an intelligent young woman who finds love with her soul mate. Their love endures the bitterness of a hard fought war and is miraculously reunited in a new country. Nkechis encounters bear witness to the true stories of several Igbo people whose lives were adversely aff ected by the war, forever changed by loss but honoured by survival, including her family." />
