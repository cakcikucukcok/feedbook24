  <title>The Life Story of a  Sculptor - Mafalda Vinciguerra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book is not an ordinary story. It is the life story of an exceptional young artist that was born in the same area of Tuscany, Italy that gave birth to Leonardo da Vinci of Mona Lisa fame, Michelangelo of the David and the Sistine Chapel ceiling and Giacomo Puccini of La Boheme and Tosca.
The young Artist Sculptor, full of art, music, love and great expectations, goes to give his love and skill in a different land with different culture and different people  the British.
The young artist is a genius, but he is not understood by the people he meets. He sees things, he experiences things and he tells them. The reader should suffer what he has suffered. And only because he was not living in the land of his birth he was treated as a foreigner even after fifty years." />
