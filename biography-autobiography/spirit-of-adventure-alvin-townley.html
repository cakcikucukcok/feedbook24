  <title>Spirit of Adventure - Alvin Townley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An extraordinary journey alongside America&#39;s new generation of Eagle Scouts, who are discovering their purpose and bringing the values of Scouting to the world.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past century, Scouts have helped to guide the course of American history. But what does Scouting and the Eagle badge mean to the Scouts of today? How will they shape the future of Scouting and America itself? In &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Adventure&lt;/i&gt;, Scouting expert and Eagle Scout Alvin Townley finds the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Townley traveled across the country and to the far corners of the globe to meet these young Eagle Scouts. He found them everywhere, continuing the life of adventure and service that they had begun in Scouting. He discovered them in Afghanistan providing medical care to villagers, in Australia saving coral reefs, at the Super Bowl and Olympic venues striving for victory, on desert cliffs and at inner-city schools teaching new lessons, in Africa bringing hope to children, and on the windswept deck of the aircraft carrier USS &lt;i&gt;Nimitz&lt;/i&gt; preparing for takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether doctors, activists, servicemen, entrepreneurs, or teachers, these young men are changing the world through bold actions that capture the essence of the Scouting tradition. In &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Adventure&lt;/i&gt;, Townley answers important questions about the future of Scouting and America, while revealing stories of service, courage, and pure excitement that introduce our nation to an inspiring new generation of leaders.&lt;/p&gt;" />
