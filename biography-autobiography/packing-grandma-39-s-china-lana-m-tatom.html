  <title>Packing Grandma&#39;s China - Lana M. Tatom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Somewhere along the way in life, you start to listen to that little voice. We are all on this journey together, growing, learning, and changing. As I stood in the kitchen of my dream home, looking out on the still water of the pond, I cried. Warm, salty tears streamed down my face as I told myself I could do this. Just start with one box; dont get overwhelmed. Pack one box; stay focused. I started packing Grandmas china first. As I packed the china set, a flood of memories came of the countless times I had carefully wrapped up each piece and placed them into the box. It was at that moment that I decided to write about this beautiful set of china, all the experiences and lessons I have learned along my journey. It is through my grandmothers journey that I have found my own strength and freedom. Twenty years and thirteen moves later, the china is the only set of dishes I own. When was the last time you used your china? What are you waiting for? Dont leave it locked up, waiting for a special occasion.  Make today the special occasion you have been waiting for.
In loving memory of my Grandma, Veronica Billetz (January 13, 1922-December 13, 2009)" />
