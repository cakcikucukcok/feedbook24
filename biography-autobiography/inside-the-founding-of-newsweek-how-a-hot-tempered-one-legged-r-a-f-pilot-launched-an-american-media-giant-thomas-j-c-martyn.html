  <title>Inside The Founding Of Newsweek: How a Hot-Tempered, One-Legged R.A.F. Pilot Launched an American Media Giant - Thomas J. C. Martyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bronze Medal winner of the 2015 Axiom Business Book Awards in the biography/memoir category. A former wartime pilot and Time magazine&#39;s first foreign editor, Thomas J. C. Martyn had a vision: to establish a weekly news magazine that would rival Time, which in the 1930s was the only magazine of its kind in the United States. Martyn succeeded--so resoundingly that Newsweek has prospered for over 80 years, first as a stalwart of print media and now in the digital era, as well. Newsweek was Martyn&#39;s brainchild, brought to life through his own perseverance and ingenuity. In this memoir he draws a vivid picture of his efforts to get Newsweek off the ground including his meetings with powerful men such as President Roosevelt and Henry Ford. This classic entrepreneur&#39;s story reveals the struggles and triumphs of getting a national magazine off the ground during the depths of the Great Depression and will entertain and engage Newsweek fans, entrepreneurs, and history buffs alike." />
