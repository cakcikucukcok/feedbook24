  <title>Black Belt for Life - Rob Smith Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rob Smiths candor about his lifes journey provides the reader with keen insights that one should apply to their own life. &lt;br&gt;-Col. Arnold Scheller, M.D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an essential book for anyone who wants to pursue excellence in life.&lt;br&gt;  Grand Master Joseph Esposito, Kenpo Karate&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt; From an internationally known Sport Psychologist&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a memoir-style account of the determination, adaptability, faith, and humility it takes to earn a Black Belt in Kenpo style karate. Psychologist and First Degree Black Belt Rob Smith candidly shares his personal successes and failures, and how they eventually lead him to pursuing the martial arts  and, ultimately, the Black Belt journey in his personal and professional life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this book, Dr. Smith offers a rare look at what happens behind the scenes during an intense, 16-week Black Belt test, with unprecedented access to the training techniques, test requirements, and high standards set by his dynamic sensei, Grand Master Joseph Esposito.&lt;i&gt;Black Belt For Life&lt;/i&gt; serves as a must-read manual for how to physically and mentally prepare for a life of continuous self-improvement. The book concludes with a summary of some key lessons Dr. Smith has learned so far in his Black Belt journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Foreword of this book is written by a man who has embodied the Black Belt path. Col. Arnold Scheller holds a Black Belt in Hapkido, served in the elite U.S. Army Rangers, and served as the team physician for the Boston Celtics from 1987-2005.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Excellent . . . and thanks for writing this book &lt;br&gt;
