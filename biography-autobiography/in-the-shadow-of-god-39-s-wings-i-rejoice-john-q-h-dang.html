  <title>In the Shadow of God&#39;s Wings I Rejoice! - John Q.H. Dang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The truth is that life is short and death is real, eternal and sorrowful if man does not have hope in the eternal God. But life is everlasting and death becomes celebratory and rejoicing if man has learned to trade in his whole being and his life for Gods mercy and compassion for eternal life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By virtue of the unfathomable mercy and compassion of the eternal Father, the eternal Son has acquired our whole being through His own blood; therefore, our soul, body, and nothingness belong to Jesus Christ, and we no longer have a say on our existence and life anymore, nor do we own our sickness and pain, or affliction and death any longer, nor are we held responsible for our weaknesses and sins again. After we have been sold to the Lord and have become His assets, our whole being is undergoing spiritual restructuring, and our personal problems will soon be fixed. When our real name is ready for public listing in His Kingdom, and when our authentic being is ready to be enlightened and revealed, we will see God face to face. Our Authentic Existence will reflect the glory of God and will be glorified by all the angels in heaven forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the judgment Day, you are invited to the largest ever and one-of-a-kind heavenly banquet in Heaven. No matter who you are provided &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    restless desire for the eternal life with hope;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	fervent hope for it with patience;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	enduring patience with what you believe in; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	unwavering confidence in what you desire for, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	genuine living out your desire with love&lt;/p&gt;" />
