  <title>Medal of Honor - Gerald Hickman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world will never forget the battle that began June 25, 1876, and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen. George Armstrong Custer divided his forces, and instead of waiting for ammunition and supplies, he attacked a huge Indian village on the Little Bighorn River in Eastern Montana Territory. No one has been able to reasonably explain the generals actions because he died along with all his men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerald Hickman, a former park ranger with the National Park Service at Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, seeks to explore the mystery. What happened that pitted the brave soldiers against fierce warrior chiefsincluding Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Lame White Man, Gaul, Wooden Leg and othersfrom the Lakota Teton Sioux, Northern Cheyenne, Southern Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chiefs did not know it then, but their victory would make the United States government and its citizens more determined than ever to place all American Indians on government-established reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a walk through history, explore one of historys greatest mysteries, and honor the brave men and women who died on hallowed ground with Medal of Honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Carnell, D.D.S. &quot;Medal of Honor is true history. I loved reading this book.  I enjoyed it so much I gave it to my Dad and he enjoyed it as much as I did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vic Bailey, Spokane Historian &quot;This book is about history but it, also, comes complete with the interesting anecdotes about the battle.  Human interest stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen McElliott, teacher, Everett, WA.&quot;Dad and Mom wanted me to send you an email thanking you for the Medal of Honor book. Dad has been reading and enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
