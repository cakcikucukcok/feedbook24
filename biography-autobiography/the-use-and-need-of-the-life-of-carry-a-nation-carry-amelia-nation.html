  <title>The Use and Need of the Life of Carry A. Nation - Carry Amelia Nation</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carrie Amelia Nation (forename sometimes spelled Carry; November 25, 1846 &amp;ndash; June 9, 1911) was an American woman who was a radical member of the temperance movement, which opposed alcohol before the advent of Prohibition. She is remembered for attacking alcohol-serving establishments (most often taverns) with a hatchet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nation was also concerned about tight clothing for women. In fact, she refused to wear a corset and urged women not to wear them because of their harmful effects on vital organs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She described herself as &amp;quot;a bulldog running along at the feet of Jesus, barking at what He doesn&amp;#39;t like&amp;quot;, and claimed a divine ordination to promote temperance by destroying bars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a primary source Nation&amp;#39;s autobiography does a great job of illuminating:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Nation&amp;#39;s belief that she was called by God to smash saloons.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The personal details of Nation&amp;#39;s life, including especially her childhood and marriages.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Nation&amp;#39;s experiences during her smashing campaign, including time spent in jail and confrontations with certain officials.&lt;br /&gt;
4. The on-going conflict between Nation and &amp;quot;main-stream&amp;quot; Christians who were critical of her work, including her second husband.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Nation&amp;#39;s use of scripture to justify her actions.&lt;br /&gt;
6. The relationship between Nation and other temperance organizations, such as the WCTU.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It really gave a good understanding of Carrie Nation and the other women of this time who suffered greatly due to alcohol and the affects that alcohol had on American families at this time." />
