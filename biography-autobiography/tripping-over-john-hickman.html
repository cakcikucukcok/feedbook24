  <title>Tripping Over - John Hickman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tripping Over &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;is a true story of life in post war England in the 1950s and 1960s. It tells the story of John, who grows up in the shadow of his dad, a returned war hero. John senses he is different but not in a good way and knows he has big shoes to fill. He is not coping well. Beleaguered and confused, poor judgement and clumsiness dog his every move.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When his parents visit the annual &lt;i&gt;Earl&#39;s Court Motor Show &lt;/i&gt;to buy a new car but return with a boat instead - turmoil follows. Later he is almost killed on a disastrous wild horse ride on Rotten Row but is he really guilty of the police accusation of fraud? As a teenager John explores his sexuality, only to fall in love for all the wrong reasons.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;John&#39;s self-deprecating reminisces are often illuminating as the reader accompanies him on his bittersweet journey of both triumph and disaster.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;John&#39;s first book &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reluctant Hero&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, is about his dad, Bill, who was a Lancaster bomber pilot in WW2. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tripping Over &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;is its sequel. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sex, Lies and Crazy People, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;published in 2014, follows on from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tripping Over. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;They are all true stories." />
