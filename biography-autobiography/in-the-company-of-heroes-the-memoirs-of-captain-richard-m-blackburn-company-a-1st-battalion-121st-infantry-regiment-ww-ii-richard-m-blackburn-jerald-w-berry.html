  <title>In the Company of Heroes: the Memoirs of Captain Richard M. Blackburn Company A, 1St Battalion, 121St Infantry Regiment - Ww Ii - Richard M. Blackburn, Jerald W. Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Never before in the history of the world had there been such cataclysmic destruction until World War II.   The entire face of the earth changed, as millions died and entire cities were razed to rubble.   World War II was the harbinger of the Holocaust and the herald of the Atomic Age.   For Americans, it was a time of intense patriotism and sacrifice in the cause of freedom throughout the world.
     Follow an American infantryman as he goes to war in the European Theater of Operations.  Walk with him among the treacherous hedgerows of Normandy and through the bitter cold of winter in Germany.  See through his eyes the death, destruction, and depravation of a world gone mad.   From the beaches of Normandy to the gates of Nazi Germany, read of heroic deeds and ultimate sacrifice.
     The vivid accounts of 1Lt. Richard Blackburn represent history in its purest forma firsthand story of how The Greatest Generation stepped up to save the world and the freedom we cherish as Americans.
I was no hero, but I am honored to have served in the company of heroesthose who gave the ultimate sacrifice and rest forever under white crosses in the far away places they helped to liberate.  Richard M. Blackburn (U.S. Army, Ret.)" />
