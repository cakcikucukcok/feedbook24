      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The definitive biography of the internationally adored author of &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Perfect Spy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;arguably one of the most important and influential writers of the post-World War II period&amp;#8212;by the National Book Critics Circle Award-winning biographer Adam Sisman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this definitive biography&amp;#8212;blessed by John le Carr&amp;#233; himself&amp;#8212;Adam Sisman reveals the man behind the bestselling persona. In &lt;em&gt;John le Carr&amp;#233;&lt;/em&gt;, Sisman shines a spotlight on David Cornwell, an expert at hiding in plain sight&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;born to lying,&amp;#8221; he wrote in 2002, &amp;#8220;bred to it, trained to it by an industry that lies for a living, practiced in it as a novelist.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the pseudonym &amp;#8220;John le Carr&amp;#233;&amp;#8221; has helped to keep the public at a distance. Sisman probes Cornwell&amp;#8217;s unusual upbringing, abandoned by his mother at the age of only five and raised by his con man father (when not in prison), and explores his background in British intelligence, as well as his struggle to become a writer, and his personal life. Sisman has benefited from unfettered access to le Carr&amp;#233;&amp;#8217;s private archive, talked to the most important people in his life, and interviewed the man himself at length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is John le Carr&amp;#233;?
