  <title>More Than Conquerors - Megan Hustad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Megan Hustad and her family try to reconcile an evangelical upbringing in a post-Christian America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Megan Hustad was a child, her father uprooted their family from Minneapolis to embark on a cross-cultural journey in the name of evangelical Christianity. As missionaries they brought the Gospel to the Caribbean island of Bonaire and later to the outskirts of Amsterdam. After a decade away, they returned to the States only to find themselves more alien than before. The evangelical landscape had transformed from the idealistic, market-averse movement it was in the 1970s to one where media-savvy pastors held sway over mega-churches. As the family struggled with the economic and spiritual aftermath of their break from middle-class Middle America, Megan and her sister, Amy, began to plot their escape.&lt;br&gt;     Megan sets her sights on New York City, where everything she was denied as a child would be at her fingertips, and Amy makes her home among the intellectual swagger of New Englanders. But fitting in proves harder than they&#39;d imagined. As much as Megan tries to shake them, thoughts of the God she was ignoring follow her into every party and relationship.&lt;br&gt;     In &lt;i&gt;More Than Conquerors&lt;/i&gt;, Hustad explores what happens when the habits of your religion coincide with the demands of your social class, and what breaks when they conflict. With a sharp tongue and deep insight, Hustad offers a vivid account of the cultural divisions, anxieties, and resentments that continue to divide our country and her own family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
