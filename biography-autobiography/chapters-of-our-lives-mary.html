  <title>Chapters of Our Lives - Mary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A work of fiction that is at turns poignant, thoughtful, redemptive and heartbreakingly sad awaits readers in Chapters Of Our Lives. The novel is divided into 32 chapters that unmask the feelings of each character through the written word.  
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Chapters Of Our Lives is based on the knowledge, imagination and perception of the author Mary. Readers will meet The Boyds - John, Mary and Robert. John and Mary is an ordinary couple living in a very influential neighborhood. John is a plumber by trade but a millionaire. They live on over two hundred acres of land which Mary calls their crowdom. Their elite neighbors do not like them, because they are blue collar workers; therefore, they have no finesse. Mary feels they are the crows among the peacocks, but she loves to be a crow rather than a peacock. She feels the crows are smarter than the peacocks. John, on the other hand, does not care what people think about him. He wants to do his work and do it well. Robert is the only son of the Boydsa brilliant child who makes mistakes and ends up in jail for murder he did not commit.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And theres Jean Peterson, Ginger, Sally, Victoria, Grandma Lainy, Damian, Grandma Bailey and the Bailey twins. The story follows the intertwining lives of these characters- struggles, conflicts, and inner demons that humans fight with every single day. Woven with such craft as if the characters leap out of the pages themselves, the author brings her creative spark to give birth to an elegant piece of fiction. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When asked what her story is all about, the author candidly replied that its all about regular things that happen to people. Yet, Chapters Of Our Lives is a solid novel that is carefully constructed, giving special attention to the details, and yet provides it characters space to breathe and exhibit feelings that are genuine, real and raw." />
