  <title>Memoirs of a Longshot - W. Cothran “Cot” Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Teenage drinking diverted Cot Campbell onto the perilous slope of alcoholism. This invidious enemy stymied the talents of young Campbell, who lurched from job to job and from jail to jail. Finally disgusted by his personal failures, Cot grasped the aid of Alcoholics Anonymous. Thereafter, he forged a rising career curve with passion, imagination, and integrity, taking his cherished wife and family along on the ride. Campbell founded one of the Souths leading advertising agencies, then found a way to turn his love of horse racing into a sporting career, and his success completed a remarkable transformation. Memoirs of a Longshot is a sprightly telling of that unique tale. It is indeed the story of a Riproarious Life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Praise for Cot Campbells Memoirs of a Longshot&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Leave it to a world-class storyteller like Cot Campbell to weave the vague, stumbling beginnings of a lad on a Tennessee horse farm with the raucous highs and desperate lows of big-time horse racing. Sprinkle the tale with such characters as Featherlip Trabue, Rhumba Pete and a one-armed barber named Baker Lane, and come out the other end with an indelible memoir of a life lived in grand and gracious style.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Jay Hovdey, Daily Racing Form&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Cot Campbell and I have had a strong working relationship for more than a decade. Reading Memoirs of a Longshot gave me a front row seat in the movie of his life  all the highs and lows and everything in between. This book is so much more than one mans autobiography, its an entertaining how to manual for an unusual life. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the history of a man I have counted as my friend for many years.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Todd Pletcher, North Americas Leading Trainer for 3 years&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Cot Campbells love of horses is matched by his love for writing. He knows the low side and the high side of life, and in &quot;Memoirs&quot;, he doesnt spare himself. From membership in AA to the winners circle in the Triple Crown and the Breeders Cup, from prep school brat to Saratoga, he has run the gamut, and you can run it with him in this, his third book.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Furman Bisher, Senior Columnist, Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Cot Campbells Dogwood Stable has been a mainstay in the world of horse racing for many years. The rollicking tale of how this came to be, and the personal travails overcome to make it so, is at times harrowing and sad, but ultimately uplifting and joyous.&lt;/P&gt;
