  <title>Concierge Confidential - Michael Fazio, Michael Malice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;New York City&#39;s top concierge gives up a keyhole view into the luxe hotel rooms, private dining and dressing rooms of the ridiculous, rich and demanding &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Michael Fazio is the ultimate behind-the-scenes support man. Want two orchestra tickets to the Broadway musical that just won the Tony? Call Fazio. How about an upgrade to first class on an overbooked overnight flight to Tokyo? Call Fazio. Or a roomful of fresh hydrangeas--in winter? That&#39;s right. Call Fazio. From his early start as the harried and neglected personal assistant to a typical L.A. casting agent, Fazio took what he learned there and moved into concierge work at New York City&#39;s Intercontinental Hotel, where he was eventually able to parlay his services into a large and successful business of his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Concierge Confidential, &lt;/I&gt;Fazio reveals the behind-thescenes madness that goes into getting the rich and famous what they want, and shares some great insider knowledge on how to get access to the unattainable without making the concierge, waiters and other service people crazy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of Fazio&#39;s tips include: &lt;br&gt;o When and how much to palm in tips &lt;br&gt;o How to get a seat or ticket to the hottest thing in town &lt;br&gt;o How to avoid being labeled a rube the minute you walk through the door &lt;br&gt;o How you can become your favorite store or restaurant&#39;s most beloved customer &lt;br&gt;o And much more&lt;/p&gt;" />
