  <title>50 Years as a U.S. Immigrant - Svein Jenshus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My fore-father Vikings arrived in North America in ships like this one over 300 years before Columbus and you&#39;ll find the historic facts in this book. I arrived in a more modern vessel. My son Earl S. Jenshus designed both the cover, showing a likeness of &quot;our Stavangerford&quot; and the back page. He is an international known graphic artist. Reading these pages you may learn a little Hawaiian, learn how to shoot birds on the wing, train dogs, buy the &quot;pick-of-the-litter&quot;, shotgun safety. How to make money investing in real estate and how to look at the similarities of languages instead of the differences. You can learn how to hypnotize chicken! More useful might be the secret of how to pronounce a-multi-syllable word the first time you see it (!) and how to have a long and happy marriage in the process. It covers 80 plus years of living on two continents, 50+ of them in different states in the USA, starting as a penniless immigrant in Brooklyn N.Y., working in different fields before I found my niche in sales. Including as well are hundreds of years of history, part of which I have actually lived and more still of what I have learned being an avid reader since early childhood." />
