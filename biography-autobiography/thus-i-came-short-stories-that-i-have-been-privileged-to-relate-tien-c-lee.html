  <title>Thus I Came: Short Stories That I Have Been Privileged to Relate - Tien C. Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, Thus I Came, is a collection of short stories which I have been privileged to relate. It starts with the joy of parenting and grandparenting pre-kindergarteners; it bounces back to my childhood memory as one son of a politcal prisoner; it recounts how my Mom survived as a poor, uneducated, de facto single mother of four children in rural Taiwan; it high-lights the ordeals my father had suffered during his five-year journey through the hell of political prison as well as his post-prison rehabilitation and inevitable bankruptcy; it briefs the struggle along my family lineage in the past 200 years; and it touches some unexpected events (in my military service, professional career, and life experiences in USA) that shaped me into a better, more mature and productive person." />
