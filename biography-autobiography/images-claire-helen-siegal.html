  <title>Images - Claire Helen Siegal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Claire Helen Siegal believed that the greatest evil in life was not to fulfill ones potential. Through the written word, a sensitive, intelligent, and acerbic voice emerges. In this autobiographypublished posthumously by her executrix, Elaine LevittClaires poetry, essays, and narrative text paint a portrait of its creator. Before she died, Claire began her quest for self-understanding through her writing.&lt;br /&gt;
From her writings, a flesh-and-blood woman emerges. She blends her variegated images to produce a self-portrait that paints her as she was in life: a vulnerable, willful, innocent, cynical, and always unforgettable woman. An idealist, Claire yearned for the ideal, but faced realitys hard, metallic edge with determination. Hers was a biting-edge, sardonic wisdom, learned at the expense of innocence. &lt;br /&gt;
Claire gave herself the moral mandate to put together this unconventional autobiography forcing you to see her importance, so her soul could have peace. She didnt want sympathy or compassion; she wanted affirmation of the life she lived, as if this could make it meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;
Her life was a study in contrast; innocent and cynical by turns. Her persona is recognizable in all her writings. She was alone. G-d was not in her life. She was Jewish and proud of it, but she removed G-d from the equation on the basis of what the Holocaust did to her family. She questioned everything, letting nothing escape her notice. &lt;br /&gt;
You will not soon forget her, or the images her life evokes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
