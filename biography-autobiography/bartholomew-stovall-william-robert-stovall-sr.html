  <title>Bartholomew Stovall - William Robert Stovall Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bartholomew Stovall, fatherless as an infant and orphaned at the age of ten, was born during the worst of times in English history. Despite the seemingly insurmountable odds against him, he dared to do the extraordinary and embarked on a journey that not only changed his life but also reshaped the future of his family. In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bartholomew Stovall - The English Immigrant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, author William Robert Stovall Sr., a descendant of Bartholomew, traces the remarkable life of this man, capturing both his hardships and conquests, while painting a portrait of life in 17th century England and America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 7, 1684, Bartholomew boards the Booth, a slave-hauling ship bound for Jamestown, Virginia. The transatlantic voyage is fraught with uncertainty, and its end marks the beginning of a new chapter in his life. Before boarding the ship, Bartholomew had signed an indenture agreement to serve four years in the New World, a decision that would prove to be life changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Virginia, Bartholomew serves plantation owner Richard Kennon and his infamous wife, Elizabeth Worsham Kennon, who quickly recognizes that he is a remarkable person. By the time he completes his indenture obligation a trust bond forms between master and servant. When offered a secure life working for the Kennon&#39;s he refuses and opts for land and tools, and begins the task of attaining his foreseen destiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compelling chronicle is based on the known facts of an English immigrant and his adventure filled journey to a new life and future. It relays a powerful message of hope, courage, and the sacrifice that must be made in order to achieve one&#39;s dreams. This is the story of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bartholomew Stovall - The English Immigrant. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
