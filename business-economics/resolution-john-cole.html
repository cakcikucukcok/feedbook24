  <title>Resolution - John Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This little book describes the lives of three twentieth century women, a first generation immigrant thrust into the disruption of World War, a product of the &#39;swinging sixties&#39;, and a modern girl born and brought up in adversity. It explores their attitudes to the woman&#39;s place in society, their gender roles, their careers and their families. The story is told against a backdrop of modern history, the three lives being inextricably entwined with major national and international events as well as some almost forgotten minor ones. All of the major characters are fictional, as are their personal events, though of necessity, historical figures are unchanged.This little book describes the lives of three twentieth century women, a first generation immigrant thrust into the disruption of World War, a product of the &#39;swinging sixties&#39;, and a modern girl born and brought up in adversity.
