  <title>Where Does the Money Go? Rev Ed: Your Guided Tour to the Federal Budget Crisis - Scott Bittle, Jean Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revised and Updated to Include the Probable Effects of the Great Recession, the Government Stimulus, and President Obama&#39;s Health Care Overhaul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal debt will affect your savings, your retirement, your mortgage, your health care, and your children. How well do you understand the government decisions that will end up coming out of your pocket? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is essential information that every American citizen needs&amp;#8212;and has the right&amp;#8212;to know. This guide to deciphering the jargon of the country&#39;s budget problem breaks down into plain English exactly what the fat cats in Washington are arguing about. &lt;em&gt;Where Does the Money Go?&lt;/em&gt; covers everything from the country&#39;s exploding federal debt to the fact that, for thirty-one out of the last thirty-five years, the country has spent more on government programs and services than it has collected in taxes. It also explores why elected leaders on both sides of the fence have so far failed to address this issue effectively and explains what you can do to protect your future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
