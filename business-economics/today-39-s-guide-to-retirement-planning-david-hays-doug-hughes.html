  <title>Today&#39;s Guide to Retirement Planning - David Hays, Doug Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The word retirement for todays retirees and soon-to-be retirees means exactly the opposite of what it meant for our parents and grandparents. It now means beginning rather than stopping. What will your next beginning be? Todays Guide to Retirement Planning, a resource for adults ages fifty and over, helps you figure it out. This is a book that actually forces you to prioritize by taking you through a personal and financial inventory to create a plan that you will follow because its your plan. The section on the big ten major financial planning roadblocks is, by itself, worth the price of admission and invaluable for everyone. This book will guide you with practical advice not only on tax, investment, and estate planning but also in coordinating that with your own personal wish list for your next beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
