  <title>Summary: It&#39;s Called Work For a Reason - Larry Winget - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “IT’S CALLED WORK FOR A REASON: Your Success Is Your Own Damn Fault” by Larry Winget.&lt;br&gt;Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.” – Thomas Edison&lt;br&gt;Most people look to external factors for why they aren’t doing well at work. However, that’s usually simply not true, even in today’s rock economic times. In It’s Called Work For A Reason, Larry Winget offers a persuasive argument for seven measures everyone can take to make sure they are fulfilling their potential at work. He suggests working hard and not fudging, selling whatever you have to offer – it won’t sell itself, having fun, but doing what you’re paid to do, amazing your customers so they will do business over and over again, firing people quickly, and remembering that results never lie. &lt;br&gt;Within that manifesto, he explains day-to-day measures for improving performance. He believes in taking personal responsibility, in recognizing that things always change, in taking action above doing nothing. Always return phone calls, he advises, take good notes, and find ways to deliver more than you promise. &lt;br&gt;Winglet doesn’t promise to tell you anything new, but he puts together all commonsense business measures into one boo, that’s stuffed full of specific, applicable measures. &lt;br&gt;" />
