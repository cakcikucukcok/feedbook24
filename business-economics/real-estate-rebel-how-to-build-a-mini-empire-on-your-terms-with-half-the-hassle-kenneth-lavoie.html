  <title>Real Estate Rebel - How to Build a &quot;Mini Empire&quot; On Your Terms With Half the Hassle - Kenneth LaVoie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The financial collapse of 2008 reminds us that we can lose half our assets quicker than divorce court! So where can the average person put those assets where they have more stability, but earn higher returns than a savings account?  Real estate is one way, but what if you already work too many hours and aren&#39;t handy around the house? And what about those horror stories about unclogging toilets at 3 a.m.? In Real Estate Rebel, Ken lays out a number of strategies that can work for nearly anyone.  Single family homes, duplexes, multi-family complexes and syndication. He also reveals some simple but game changing money and debt management techniques that can make you richer without doing any extra work. Deb lays out her tenant placement system, which has resulted in their buildings being full of respectable &quot;class act&quot; tenants.  Ken is a student of the &quot;80/20 Rule&quot; which says 80% of our results come from 20% of our efforts.  And that&#39;s what this book is really about; having tons of success with half the hassle." />
