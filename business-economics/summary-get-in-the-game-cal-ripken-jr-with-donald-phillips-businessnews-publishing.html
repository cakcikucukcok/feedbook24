  <title>Summary: Get in the Game - Cal Ripken Jr. with Donald Phillips - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “GET IN THE GAME: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference” by Cal Ripken Jr. and Donald Phillips.Cal Ripken Jr. played for twenty one seasons as a major league baseball player for the Baltimore Orioles. He earned a reputation as an “Iron Man” by playing 2,632 consecutive games – the equivalent of not missing a day’s work in seventeen years. During that time, he amassed more than three thousand hits and four hundred home runs – one of only eight players in the history of baseball to do so. He has also made a successful transition from baseball to business by becoming the president and CEO of the Ripken Baseball Group which runs minor league teams and amateur baseball training camps. In Get in the Game, Cal Ripken Jr. describes eight principles – each with its own chapter – that helped him to excel throughout his career: 1. The Right Values  2. A Strong Will to Succeed  3. Love What You Do  4. Preparation  5. Anticipation  6. Trusting Relationships  7. Life Management  and 8. The Courage of Your Convictions. Whatever game you’re in, Get in the Game is well worth reading. This illuminating book will inspire you to persevere." />
