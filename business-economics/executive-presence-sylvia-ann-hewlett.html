  <title>Executive Presence - Sylvia Ann Hewlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you &amp;#8220;leadership material?&amp;#8221; More importantly, do others perceive you to be? Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a noted expert on workplace power and influence, shows you how to identify and embody the Executive Presence (EP) that you need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can have the experience and qualifications of a leader, but without executive presence, you won&amp;#39;t advance. EP is an amalgam of qualities that true leaders exude, a presence that telegraphs you&amp;#39;re in charge or deserve to be. Articulating those qualities isn&amp;#39;t easy, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a nationwide survey of college graduates working across a range of sectors and occupations, Sylvia Hewlett and the Center for Talent Innovation discovered that EP is a dynamic, cohesive mix of appearance, communication, and gravitas. While these elements are not equal, to have true EP, you must know how to use all of them to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with eye-opening insights, analysis, and practical advice for both men and women, mixed with illustrative examples from executives learning to use the EP, &lt;em&gt;Executive Presence&lt;/em&gt; will help you make the leap from working like an executive to feeling like an executive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
