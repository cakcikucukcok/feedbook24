  <title>Real Estate License Exam Prep - David Cusic &amp; Ryan Mettling Stephen Mettling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Features of Real Estate License Exam Prep (RELEP):
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;National Principles &amp;amp; Law Key Point Review (45 pages)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Real Estate Math Key Formula Review &amp;amp; Practice (20 pages)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;National Practice Tests (500 questions)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sample Exam (75 questions)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We know the real estate licensing exam can be tough, and very nerve-wracking to prepare for. That&amp;rsquo;s why we created the Real Estate License Exam Prep (RELEP) the way we did. Since we have been managing real estate schools and developing curriculum for forty years, we know how all this works &amp;ndash; or fails to work.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	First, RELEP is comprehensive in that it contains both key content review and testing practice. RELEP&amp;rsquo;s national key point reviews are a succinct compression of tested national principles and practices that comprise the national portion of state license exams from coast to coast. Our content is drawn from our own national textbook, Principles of Real Estate Practice &amp;ndash; one of the most widely used principles textbooks in the country. Thus the breadth and depth of the law reviews and test questions reflect the topic emphasis of the three major testing services for the national portion of the state exam.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A word about the test questions&amp;hellip; RELEP&amp;rsquo;s testing practice section consists of ten national practice tests and one sample test. The practice tests are roughly 50 questions in length and the sample test is 75 questions. The questions are direct, to the point, and designed to test your understanding. When you have completed a given test, you can check your answers against the answer key in the appendix. You may also note that each question&amp;rsquo;s answer is accompanied by a brief explanation, or &amp;ldquo;rationale&amp;rdquo; to further reinforce your understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Your particular study and testing practice strategy using RELEP is up to you. But to fully exploit its comprehensive content coverage, you should try to review and memorize the key point reviews as much as possible. Then you should make every effort to take each exam, review your mistakes, and re-read the key point reviews that cover your weaker areas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One note of caution is also in order: this National edition of RELEP does not contain state laws and practices applicable in your state of residence or where you intend to get your license. Therefore you will need to study state-level laws given to you by your prelicense school in order to pass the state portion of the state exam. While we are in the process of adding state-level materials to our RELEP series we still have a ways to go. So, until we have state review materials for your state, we give you this publication &amp;ndash; a total-coverage review and practice resource of the highest quality for the national portion of the state exam.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve have been straightforward with you, a second word of caution. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by other national prep books &amp;ndash; that contain no state-level materials &amp;ndash; that advertise you will pass your state exam by learning and reviewing what&amp;rsquo;s in their publication. You won&amp;rsquo;t. It is absolutely essential that you develop a comprehensive understanding of both national and state laws and principles in order to pass your state&amp;rsquo;s license examination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	While RELEP is as comprehensive a national prep text as it gets, in the end -- as your prelicense course hopefully informed you -- it&amp;rsquo;s all up to you. It still takes hard work and study to pass. But we have done our best here to get you ready for the national portion of the state exam. Following that, the most we can do is wish you the best of success in taking and passing your state exam. So good luck!!&lt;br /&gt;
