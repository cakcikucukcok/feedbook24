  <title>It&#39;s Not What You Sell-It&#39;s How You Sell It: Outshine Your Competition &amp; Create Loyal Customers - Michael Saraf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether you own a business, help manage one, or work in sales and marketing, you&#39;ll achieve more when you focus on how you sell instead of what you sell.  Michael Saraf, a sales and marketing professional with more than twenty years of experience helping individuals and organizations succeed, walks you through a different approach to win more business from customers. Learn how to:  • build a sales and marketing program that speaks to your target audience; • take advantage of open doors left behind by competitors; • boost &quot;mind share&quot; in order to get more market share; • deliver value repeatedly by focusing on the little things.  You&#39;ll also come to understand the most important element that keeps underperforming companies from becoming good and good companies from becoming great-and that&#39;s service. When you treat service as the umbrella over everything, including the product, you&#39;ll develop stronger relationships with customers and get to the promised land of customer loyalty." />
