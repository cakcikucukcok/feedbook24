The book starts with setting the scenes and addressing the current challenges and opportunities for growing project management as a strategically vital domain for all types of organizations, in the public and private sector, for projects pursued for profit or not for profit, small or large, simple or complex. This book provides a comprehensive explanations of a project management methodological approach, its critical concepts, and how to apply this methodology on a diversity of projects. 
The Customizable and Adaptable Methodology for Managing Projects (CAM2P). CAM2P is the methodological approach developed by the author in 2007-2008 and has been using since that time on internal and clients projects. The author will also explain and demonstrate how to integrate, effectively, highly valuable concepts from the PMBOK Guide (the process groups and knowledge areas) with a project life span approach, such as what CAM2P offers.

The author emphasizes that to learn any project management methodology, the learners, must apply the learned concept on real projects, and this book will guide them as they move along the project life span from idea to closure." />
