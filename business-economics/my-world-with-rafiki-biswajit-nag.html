  <title>My World with Rafiki - Biswajit Nag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rafiki means friend in Kiswahili language, which is spoken in a large part of Africa. The book reflects the authors own way of detailing the importance of cooperation for Indian managers in international business as part of his teaching in MBA class. It is full of anecdotal evidence that have made it an articulate polemic and provide a counterintuitive look toward understanding the business environment.
Biswajit  has written a fascinating book. He takes an unusual path, and with warmth and accessibility weaves stories and travel adventures around a serious but humanized discussion of crucial economic and social issues. The author treats us to a vividly narrated reminder of the extraordinary value of diversity and the importance of learning from the realities of others. This rich and readable chronicle will be enjoyed by many. 
-  Patrick Low, Vice President of Research, Fung Global Institute, Hong Kong and  Former Chief Economist of the World Trade Organization
Biswajit whips up a wonderful plate of cross country experiences. The fast paced book illustrates the perils of attaching labels like emerging market economies that lull MNCs to ignore the rich diversity and consequent opportunity these countries offer.
- Subhomoy Bhattacharjee, Deputy Editor, Indian Express
My World with Rafiki is a powerful narrative with opinions and doubts that ignite alternative thinking and discernment about the contemporary world. A superb mix of stories and theories, the breathtaking speed of commentary and lively anecdotes keep you wondering for the next surprise.
