  <title>Ben Bernanke&#39;s Fed: The Federal Reserve After Greenspan - Ethan S. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Ben Bernanke&#39;s swearing in as Federal Reserve chairman in 2006 marked the end of Alan Greenspan&#39;s long, legendary career. To date, the new chair has garnered mixed reviews. Business economists see him as the best-qualified successor to Greenspan, while many traders and investors worry that he&#39;s too academic for the job. Meanwhile, many ordinary Americans do not even know who he is.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How will Bernanke&#39;s leadership affect the Fed&#39;s actions in the coming years? How will Bernanke build on Greenspan&#39;s success, but also put his own stamp on the Fed? What will all this imply for businesses and investors? In Ben Bernanke&#39;s Fed, Ethan Harris provides exceptional insights into these crucial issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As a leading &quot;Fed watch&quot; economist, Harris draws on Bernanke&#39;s academic research, his speeches as a governor of the Fed, and his first two years on the job to shed light on:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183; How the Federal Reserve analyzes and manages the economy using a synthesis of classical and Keynesian theory&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183; Bernanke&#39;s strategies for fighting inflation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183; The implications of the new chair&#39;s remarkably plain-spoken style&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183; How Bernanke has cultivated diverse viewpoints but still builds consensus within the Fed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Engaging and discerning, this book demystifies the man who has stepped into what many describe as the second most powerful job in America.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
