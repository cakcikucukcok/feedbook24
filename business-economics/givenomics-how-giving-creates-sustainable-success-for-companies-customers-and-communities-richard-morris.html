  <title>Givenomics: How giving creates sustainable success for companies, customers and communities - Richard Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are current business models part of the problem or part of the solution? Givenomics draws upon the experience of building a not for profit social enterprise called TheGivingMachine from an idea into a successful venture that has already generated its first half a million free donations to date. In looking at the social impact, it was clear that there was something deeper at work in the way companies, customers and communities were being connected to make a positive difference for all. The result is Givenomics - a concept for those who want to see businesses as a force for good with new ways to engage their customer base, customer empowerment to support their communities and new ways for community organisations to gain and maintain vital support in a tough climate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
