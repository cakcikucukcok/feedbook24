  <title>Strategies for Sustainable Transformation of Developing Countries - Mark Izevbekhai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Strategies for the Sustainable Transformation of Developing Countries attempts a holistic-solution approach through sustainable development concepts and principles to address challenges in developing countries. In fact, the book is the application of sustainable development, and thus it offers strategies that could be applied to the development and transformation of social, economical, and environmental dimensions of society using the example of Nigeria, a developing country in West Africa. The book is divided into five parts, coveringcritical subjects of development which include education, government and good governance, community security, leadership, and community development. It provides answers to how sustainable development can bring change and benefits to these subject matters within the context of developing countries, using Nigeria as an example. This book is very different from many other book written on the challenges of development, particularly on African countries, in the sense that it gives priority to solutions and mapping them out in a feasible, sustainable, and practical way. The cornerstone of the book is the emphatic suggestion of a national transition initiative programme and Sustainable Community development Programme to drive sustainable development from the top and the bottom of society respectively." />
