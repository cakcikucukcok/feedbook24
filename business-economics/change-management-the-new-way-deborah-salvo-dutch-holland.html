  <title>Change Management: the New Way - Deborah Salvo, Dutch Holland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With 70% of change projects not meeting management expectations, can we conclude that the current way of doing change management works well (or even works at all)? Do we need a New Way to make organizational change happen? Yes, it is time. This book identifies ten new ways that can be used to make change management more effectively and efficiently. One of the ten ways is the use of the theater metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to change a play, you must start by selecting and communicating a new script to your theater company. If you want to change an organization, you must start by communicating to organization members a new vision of where the organization needs to be at some future time. If you want to change the play, you must put actors under contract for the new play and rehearse them until they can perform their roles perfectly. If you want to change an organization, workers must be under agreement to perform to new job descriptions and goals  and be trained in new work processes and new technology. And so it goes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your life-long familiarity with the idea of a &quot;play, you will be able to make organizational change happen flawlessly. This book will show you how to excel at &lt;em&gt;leading change&lt;/em&gt;, from either a management position or from an assignment as a change professional. This book is designed to put managers and change professionals &quot;on the same page for leading change, using simple practical ideas and metaphors, backed by proven bodies of knowledge from management, the behavioral sciences  and the theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;You dont have to be afraid of change any longer! Dutchs work offers entertaining and simple solutions that will help you move swiftly and efficiently through the growing pains of organizational change. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
