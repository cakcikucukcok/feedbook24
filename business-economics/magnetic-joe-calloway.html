This innovative text examines a range of simple, powerful strategies that businesses of any size or type can use to attract new customers. The key is to do those things that harness the power of the single most important factor in buying decisions: positive word of mouth and referrals from happy existing customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnetic businesses are intentional, strategic, and focused on creating positive experiences that become the stories their customers tell about them.

There is no one-size-fits-all formula, but with creativity and focus, any business can create a powerful revenue growth engine that continuously works to build and sustain success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learn how to match successful growth strategies with your people, purpose, and culture to create your own unique &#39;magnetism&#39; to attract business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Discover the simple, powerful keys to growth used by a range of market leading businesses, from a snowboard manufacturing startup company and a website design professional to a minor league baseball team and an family owned upscale grocery store.
