  <title>Real Business Secrets: Bootstrapping a Multi National Business Empire: Leaders Are Made, Not Born - Gerard J. Brandon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no such thing as a successful Entrepreneur. Success and failure go hand in hand with being an Entrepreneur. Failure is merely the cost of an expensive education on how not to do it that way again.   In this book, I will show you what it takes to reach substantial goals in devising, creating, buying and building a multi-national business.   As Founder and CEO of Alltracel Pharmaceuticals PLC in 1996, that start-up company was eventually sold for $55m in 2008. As CEO of Cellulac PLC I drove its value to $40m having joined in 2012 when it was $300,000 in debt.   Having listed companies on the London Stock Exchange, buying them with zero cash, deep in debt, and building them pretty much from the bottom up. The lessons I have learned, having lived, worked and struggled through it all, are here in this book.  Being an Entrepreneur continues to be the most enjoyable, stimulating, challenging, soul-destroying, gut-wrenching roller-coaster of a ride, that I would not hesitate to do over and over again" />
