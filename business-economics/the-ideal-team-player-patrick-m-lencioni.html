  <title>The Ideal Team Player - Patrick M. Lencioni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his classic book, &lt;i&gt;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&lt;/i&gt;, Patrick Lencioni laid out a groundbreaking approach for tackling the perilous group behaviors that destroy teamwork. Here he turns his focus to the individual, revealing the three indispensable virtues of an ideal team player.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Ideal Team Player&lt;/i&gt;, Lencioni tells the story of Jeff Shanley, a leader desperate to save his uncle’s company by restoring its cultural commitment to teamwork. Jeff must crack the code on the virtues that real team players possess, and then build a culture of hiring and development around those virtues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond the fable, Lencioni presents a practical framework and actionable tools for identifying, hiring, and developing ideal team players.  Whether you’re a leader trying to create a culture around teamwork, a staffing professional looking to hire real team players, or a team player wanting to improve yourself, this book will prove to be as useful as it is compelling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
