  <title>1,134 Days to 0 - Heather DeVito</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mountains of bills and credit debt dont appear overnight, nor can they be erased by the time you wake in the morning. Debt is not something that happens to you. Debt sometimes comes from poor choices and the desire to have more than you can afford. Its time to give instant gratification an overhaul and realize whats important. This may require a return to the days of a more simple life when we earned it before we spent it. Engulfing debt, sleepless nights, and never-ending worry can be rectified with three easy tools: discipline, sacrifice, and patience. Once you learn how to make and stick to a budget, youll be on the path to a debt-free life. If youre in an overwhelming financial pit, youll need the tools to help you out of the abyss. Here youll find the guidance to help.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1,134 Days to 0&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of witty stories and true, heartfelt experiences that guide you along the path to financial freedom. It was written in laymans terms by an everyday person, not your typical intimidating financial guru. Youll laugh, youll cry, youll be inspired but most of all, youll relate. Through the course of your reading, you will have your aha moment, when everything seems clear. You will comprehend that true sacrifice can come in many forms. This may be making sure your children have properly fitted clothes and shoes, or a nutritious meal while you are resewing your hems to get one more season out of your work pants. You may recognize yourself in the stories, realize where you went wrong, and identify how to correct your mistakes. In the end, you can reminisce about days gone past when you were in over your head. Youll find your inner rock star and become a savvy shopper and ultimate budget-keeper.&lt;/p&gt;" />
