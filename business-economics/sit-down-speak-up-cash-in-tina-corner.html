  <title>Sit Down! Speak Up! Cash In! - Tina Corner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover how a peer advisory group can reconnect you with the clarity, creativity, competitive advantage, and energy that first inspired you to start your own business or to take the reins of an existing enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina nailed it! Every word is spot-on and accurate. Ive been in peer advisory groups for the last twenty-five years, and 50 percent of the successful business owners I know and work with are in one as well. They are a must for any business owner who wants to maximize his or her full potential.&lt;br /&gt;
Gino Wickman, author of Traction and creator of EOS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina captures not only the how but the why in this great read on peer advisory groups. As a banker committed to helping their clients, we learn that no one person can do it all. Tinas peer advisory groups have helped us to help our customers reach their true potential.&lt;br /&gt;
Mary Ann Scully, chairman and CEO, Howard Bank&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been in many peer groups in my career. They have been powerful for my companies and my personal growth. This book gives insights I wish I would have had prior to being in these groups. This is a powerful how-to book.&lt;br /&gt;
Larry Linne, CEO, and author of Brand Aid and Make the Noise Go Away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured, confidential peer mentorship groups have proved to be a particularly effective way for our members to accelerate their growth and reduce their risk, both as companies and as founders and owners.&lt;br /&gt;
