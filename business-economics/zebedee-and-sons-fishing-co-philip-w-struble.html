  <title>Zebedee and Sons Fishing Co. - Philip W. Struble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One favorite story in the Bible is Jesus calling his first disciples along the Sea of Galilee.  Unfortunately, when Jesus called James, John, Peter, and Andrew to a life of ministry, he called them away from their business partner Zebedee.  Zebedee, a first-century fisherman, devoted Jew and entrepreneur, watched his partners choose to walk away from their business obligations and follow Jesus to become fishers of men. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we are taught to turn to the Bible when we are in need of guidance. When we are lost, confused, seeking growth or opportunity, Gods Word is our source of strength and understanding.  And even though we may believe and practice Jesuss teachings  we have unfortunately learned to separate our Christian values from our workplace.   We turn to self-help books on management, workshops about accountability,or seminars on increasing our business traffic. We seek guidance from those successful in our industry or other experts in the secular world.&lt;/p.
	&lt;p&gt;As company leaders, we all too often forget that the most valuable source of information we have is from the Creator himself, and is found in His Word which is designed to guide us through all of lifes journeys. This includes even our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This book is looking at our 21st-century business world through Zebedees eyes.  It demonstrates that the biblical knowledge from the first-century is applicable to our business world today.  Zebedee will show us how we can better understand how God wants us to run our businesses, even in the face of struggles, despair and confusion. He shows us how to establish sound business practices based on His Word, and how to lead our businesses in the way God has called us. The Bible is really the only book we need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
