The well-paced action takes place in present day Italy, northern Ireland and back tracks to the 1980's miners' strike. Well-written with plausible characters who speak believable dialogue providing the reader with a sense of realism.<br /><b><i>Gladio: Steve Chambers: 9781903506387: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Steve Chambers is the author of Photographic Memory Mastery (3.14 avg rating, 7 ratings, 2 reviews), Gladio (3.27 avg rating, 11 ratings, 4 reviews, publ...<br /><b><i>Steve Chambers (Author of Gladio) - Goodreads</i></b> | It's Steve Chambers' first novel but he is an experienced TV script writer and I think that experience shines through in terms of his control of the plot detail. The story line does get over convoluted in the final third as double cross piles on double cross but the general thrust of the plot is good and he captures the sense of mid-Eighties, Thatcherite Britain really well.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Gladio - Steve Chambers</a> </h3></p><hr/>
