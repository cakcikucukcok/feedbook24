  <title>What the Internet Can’T Teach You - Lou Pritchett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ADVANCE PRAISE FOR &lt;i&gt;WHAT THE INTERNET CANT TEACH YOU&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In a new digital world where instant communication has left us feeling more disconnected than ever, it is the tried and tested values and principles that really make the difference to todays managers. Theres a reason why guys like Sam Walton and Lou Pritchett have been so successful. We should all be so lucky as to listen and find out why.&lt;br&gt; 
DAN MANGRU, &lt;br&gt; Host of &lt;i&gt;The Mangru Report&lt;/i&gt; on Fox Business&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; What the Internet Cant Teach You has, in one place, the lessons one learns in a military career. I know many military people who failed because they didnt learn these principles of leadership and management! &lt;br&gt; 
COL. WILL MERRILL, &lt;br&gt; 
West Point, Class of 1958, Airborne Ranger, US Army (ret) &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; I wish I had had Lous book back in 1986 when we introduced Stainmaster carpeting to the world. His succinct maxims are a timeless road map to business success, cutting through the fog of circumstance and technology. I recommend it to all young aspiring leaders. &lt;br&gt; 
TOM MCANDREWS, the Father of Stainmaster, &lt;br&gt; 
Former DuPont Worldwide Director, Flooring Systems&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each morning, millions of managersfrom supervisors at McDonalds to Fortune 500 presidentscommute to their respective jobs, where their subordinates rely on their leadership, advice, and coaching in order to be successful themselves. Desperate to achieve greatness in a highly competitive world driven by technology, these leaders are often frustrated with the loss of one-on-one mentorship from a boss who has been there. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lou Pritchett, a former executive who was instrumental in the creation of the partnership between Procter &amp; Gamble and Wal-Mart, shares decades of hands-on experience in company leadership, training, and organizational development in order to mentor others with snippets of wisdom and universal truth not found in cyberspace. Future leaders that include entrepreneurs, educators, executives, administrative assistants, and sales representatives will find inspiration in both Pritchetts wisdom and the seasoned advice of other famous leaders, such as Napoleon Bonaparte, John F. Kennedy, Stonewall Jackson, and Ross Perot. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Management is of dollars and things. Leadership is of hearts, souls, and spirits. In What the Internet Cant Teach You, Pritchett allows others to take a step back in time and learn the same way successful leaders have learned for centuriesthrough the wisdom of those who know.&lt;/p&gt;" />
