  <title>The 360 Degree Leader - John C. Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for that promotion! Start leading NOW&amp;hellip;right where you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the number one question leadership expert John C. Maxwell is asked while conducting his leadership conferences? &amp;ldquo;How can I implement what you teach when I&amp;rsquo;m not the top leader?&amp;rdquo;. Is it possible to lead well when you&amp;rsquo;re not the top dog? How about if the person you work for is a bad leader? The answer is a resounding yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The 360&amp;deg; Leader. People who desire to lead from the middle of organizations face unique challenges. And they are often held back by myths that prevent them from developing their influence. Dr. Maxwell, one of the globe&amp;rsquo;s most trusted leadership mentors, debunks the myths, shows you how to overcome the challenges, and teaches you the skills you need to become a 360&amp;deg; leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have found yourself trying to lead from the middle of the organization, as the vast majority of professionals do, then you need Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s insights. You have a unique opportunity to exercise influence in all directions&amp;mdash;up (to the boss), across (among your peers), and down (to those you lead). The good news is that your influence is greater than you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice the disciplines of 360&amp;deg; leadership and the opportunities will be endless . . . for your organization, for your career, and for your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
