  <title>Selling on Purpose - Philip R. Moncrief</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sales is the most exciting, most rewarding career in industry.  Sales is the key to business success.  Nothing happens until a sale is made.  Companies who execute well but do not sell, go out of business.  The companies that have and value top Salesmen are usually the most successful.  
Here are the four secrets to successful selling:
	Dont sell, help your Clients buy.
	Find out what they want.
	Figure out how to give them what they want.
	Find out what its worth to them and then quote your price.
You, the Salesman, have a responsibility to yourself and your company to think through your sales approach and plans and to do things on purpose.  The best Salesmen dont just let things happen, they plan for their success and then work the plan.  In fact the biggest difference between average and excellent Salesmen is that excellent Salesmen make things happen and they make happen the things that make them successful.  If you get nothing else from this book, get the idea  SELL ON PURPOSE.
In Selling on Purpose, Philip Moncrief has finally written the sales primer that has long been missing.  From prospecting to closing, from relationship building to proposing, its all here.  New salesmen will learn the essentials of the profession, experienced salesmen will learn the key ingredients to increased sales and sales career success.
This is a book on Sales in the Engineering Construction industry.  Even so, the approach and the lessons apply equally well in most sales situations.  The process and the details may need some adaptation, but the basics apply in all sales situations.  
Comments from reviewers include:
Wow,  I wish I had this book when I started out in sales.
There are a lot of great suggestions for salesmen like me in this book.
I learned a lot of new things and was reminded of others that will increase my win rate." />
