  <title>Summary: Business @ The Speed Of Thought - Bill Gates - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “BUSINESS @ THE SPEED OF THOUGHT: Using a Digital Nervous System” by Bill Gates.In Business @ The Speed Of Thought, Bill Gates argues that competitive business advantage in the twenty-first century will revolve around an organization’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances rapidly. To achieve this, information needs to flow within the business enterprise efficiently. The best way to achieve this is by building a Digital Nervous System.A Digital Nervous System combines personal computer, Internet and communications technologies. It will be the conceptual framework around which a better understanding of the challenges of the marketplace will be constructed – and from which the company’s response will be planned and implemented.Any company that can integrate the transfer of information around the organization so completely that business decisions at all levels of the organization can literally be made as quickly as information becomes available will be ideally suited to the demands and requirements of the evolving business environment.Business @ The Speed of Thought is a book for you if you wish to have an insight into the Digital Nervous System, the ‘‘killer application’’ of business in the twenty-first century." />
