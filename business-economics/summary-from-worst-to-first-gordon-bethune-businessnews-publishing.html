      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “FROM WORST TO FIRST: Behind the Scenes of Continental’s Remarkable Comeback” by Gordon Bethune. Ultimately, business is about people.  That’s what Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune demonstrates in this brilliant business book. The author tells how he led Continental&#39;s transformation into a successful carrier after years as an unprofitable airline hated by employees and customers.According to Gordon Bethune, everything you do to create a successful company or to forge a successful career will depend on your ability to create, develop and maintain good, healthy, honest and straight-forward relationships. There’s no such thing as a successful company that has a product nobody wants and where employees don’t want to come to work. Therefore, you need to create an environment at work in which employees create added value by serving the customers and each other. When people feel good about the value they’re creating, they become highly motivated. Filled with numerous anecdotes, From Worst to First is an essential read for all managers. If you are willing to change the way you’re running your business, this book is an excellent guide." />
