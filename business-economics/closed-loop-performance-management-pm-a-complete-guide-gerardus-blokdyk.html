  <title>Closed-Loop Performance Management (PM) A Complete Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How can we improve Closed-Loop Performance Management (PM)?  How does the organization define, manage, and improve its Closed-Loop Performance Management (PM) processes?  Are we making progress? and are we making progress as Closed-Loop Performance Management (PM) leaders?  What will drive Closed-Loop Performance Management (PM) change?  Are assumptions made in Closed-Loop Performance Management (PM) stated explicitly?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
