  <title>What I Didn&#39;t Learn in Business School: How Strategy Works in the Real World - Jay Barney, Trish Gorman Clifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Meet Justin Campbell. He&#39;s a new MBA graduate who&#39;s landed a job with a strategy consultancy. His engagement team is on a mission: help HGS Inc., a specialty chemicals firm, define and execute a strategy for exploiting a textile technology the company developed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Justin and his team deploy state-of-the-art strategy tools to analyze the attractiveness of potential markets for the technology. But they soon realize the tools don&#39;t help them grapple with the human side of strategy--including political forces swirling within HGS. Everyone involved in the engagement is biased and insecure, brilliant and hardworking, selfish and lazy, loyal and dedicated. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Justin and his cohorts aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot;--What I Didn&#39;t Learn in Business School is a business novel. But they&#39;re realistic: they&#39;re just like us. Their story reveals the limitations of strategy tools and demonstrates tactics for navigating the messy, human dynamics that can make or break a company&#39;s strategy efforts. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This engaging book uses the power of story to present potent lessons for anyone seeking to excel at strategy management. It&#39;s a compelling read--whether you&#39;re an MBA grad struggling to apply what you learned or in the fray and eager to see what MBAs get wrong when they land in the real world.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
