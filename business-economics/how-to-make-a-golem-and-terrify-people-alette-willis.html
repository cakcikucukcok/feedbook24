  <title>How to Make a Golem (and Terrify People) - Alette Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;You think you&#39;re a fairy godmother or something?&quot; I asked.&quot;Or something,&quot; Michael agreed. Edda is tired of her nickname, &#39;Mouse&#39;, and wants to be braver. But when her house is burgled on her twelfth birthday, Edda is more afraid than ever. That is until new boy Michael Scot starts school. There&#39;s something peculiar -- and very annoying -- about know-it-all Michael. He claims to be a great alchemist who can help Edda overcome her fears by teaching her to build a golem. But surely they can&#39;t bring a giant mud monster to life? Can they?
