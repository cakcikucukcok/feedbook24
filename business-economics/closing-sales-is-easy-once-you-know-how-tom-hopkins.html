  <title>Closing Sales is Easy: Once You Know How - Tom Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The fun part of selling yourself, a product or a service is the demonstration or presentation. But the aspect of selling that makes you successful is having the ability to close the sale, get the decision made in your favor, get the check, credit card, purchase order or a signature on an agreement. Closing the sale is where most people balk, feel uncomfortable or even stall. They just can&#39;t bring themselves to ask someone for money -- even when the person will receive incredible benefits in exchange for that money. Even worse, people ask for the sale and when the buyer doesn&#39;t immediately jump at it, they change the subject and stop the sale themselves.Don&#39;t let this happen to you. When done properly, the move into closing the sale is smooth as silk. And when you handle the close as Tom Hopkins teaches you, you&#39;ll walk away with more business than you thought you could ever get.Knowledge builds competence and confidence. Become a more confident (and more successful) salesperson. Get started by reading and implementing the strategies in this book. It&#39;ll be the best return on your money you&#39;ve ever gotten!" />
