      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The essential book every workplace novice needs&amp;#8212;a smart, practical, and fun guide to help them navigate the minefield of personalities, learn to work with their boss, identify priorities, and ultimately kick butt at their first job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a challenging time to be young and new in the workplace. Your parents can&amp;#8217;t help&amp;#8212;the rules have all changed, and faster than guide books can keep up. In &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Real World&lt;/em&gt;, career expert and entrepreneur Lauren Berger arms a new generation of workers like you with the tools you need to succeed. She feels your pain. She&amp;#8217;s been in your shoes. Just a few years ago, she was you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world defined by uncertainty, she argues you need to be bold, take risks, and understand your value. She shows you how to think of your job as a link that will eventually connect you to the opportunity of your dreams. It&amp;#8217;s time to get comfortable getting uncomfortable, she advises. Her essential handbook tells you everything you should know to make the most of your first on-the-job experience, including how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Think about &amp;#8220;The Big Picture&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Deal with rejection&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Effectively manage your time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Navigate &amp;#8220;sticky situations&amp;#8221; in the office and communicate with different personality types&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Embrace entrepreneurship regardless of position, rank, or title&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Organize your financial situation and personal life&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Get promoted and (one day) take your boss&amp;#8217; job!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
