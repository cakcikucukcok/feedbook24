  <title>California Oil and Gas, a Business of Sports and Economy - Jimmy Hindle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An expert craftsmanship of sports journalism and a powerful statement about the business of sports and economy. Certain character depictions are fictitious to convey the utter seriousness of a sport&#39;s specification where the ownerships of Champcar waged a boycott against IndyCar and Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS). Otherwise, &quot;oil and gas&quot; is a tightening up of economic realities, the real people on the verge of a financial takeover and how such economies work in relation to Major Leagues Sports in historically speaking the most productive times in U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Heists are back and Phil Elmach driving for James Sedgwick. Only in &quot;oil and gas,&quot; Elmach joins Jake Coote and the experts in the Sunshine State. Turbochargers made the stealthiest cars, and successively IndyCar&#39;s resolution of a sport&#39;s escalation costs. To the supercops, the top outfits in the Champcar-IndyCar merger war pose a threat in a downturn economy and the owner-teams recognize that tires aren&#39;t the only switch-ups, but teams transferring into IndyCar. In the shuffle of cash, egos, and clashes, everyone gets caught to the comic drama of staying steps ahead of a supercop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chase, the story distinguishes myth from the legendary figures. Miles Deere&#39;s epic battles fit the grand schemes. Ground effects sold on American March know-how was a version of Desert Storm on neighboring Area 51 and runs open wheel cars in excess of constructor rules. The Heists have nabbed the technology, or at least former American March Jake Coote as advisor-teammate to Elmach&#39;s own answers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
