  <title>Development in Unity Volume Two - Daasebre Prof. Oti Boateng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Development in Unity Volume Two represents an eclectic repertoire of over forty years exploits and profile of a renowned international scholar and an eminent cultural African leader, Daasebre Professor (Emeritus) Oti Boateng, to inspire a new generational philosophy of development. 
In this treatise, the author, a distinguished authority in statistics, a United Nations Commissioner, and a recipient of several national and international awards, including recognition by the American Biographic Institute as one of the five hundred best thinkers of the twenty-first century, seeks to blend scholarship and culture as mutually inclusive prerequisites to underpin contemporary models in addressing pertinent development challenges. 
The book pioneers an alternative innovative root-based development model to harness the potential of indigenous institutions of governance in ensuring self-sustaining inclusive local economic development as a hedge against poverty, insurgency mobilization, migration, and radicalization in response to the demands of contemporary global development challenges. 
It elucidates the truth that development has manifold aspects, dealing with every aspect of human life, and addresses its intrinsic challenges from an eclectic and multidisciplinary perspective. In this respect, the book covers diverse areas ranging from entrepreneurial collaboration for sustainable microprogress, gender-sensitive statistics to democratic governance through credible elections. Other areas include harmonization of tradition and modernity in the chieftaincy institution, integration of ECOWAS statistical systems, space science and satellite technology, oil and gas exploration, construction of poverty profiles, religion, and the cocoa industry. 
Every section of the book is filled with leadership lessons to inspire a new development approach and intellectual assertiveness. 
This very penetrating book fills an important knowledge gap between theory and experiential learning in the development process. It is a melting pot of lessons for all readers." />
