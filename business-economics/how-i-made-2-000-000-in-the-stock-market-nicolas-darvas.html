  <title>How I Made ,000,000 in the Stock Market - Nicolas Darvas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nicolas Darvas was a world famous dancer and a self-taught investor. He had never considered investing in the stock market until he was paid in stock for a performance. That stock shot up in value and he realized that there was a great deal of money to be made investing in stocks. Over the next few years he read widely about stocks and spent every free moment studying the market. In a very short amount of time he learned when to buy, when not to buy, and when to sell. This book spells out exactly how Nicolas Darvas made more than two million dollars in the stock market. A must read for anyone considering entering the market or for anyone who is already in the market who wishes to hone their stock selecting skills.   &quot;How to find what stocks to buy? You could not pick them out with a pin. You must have information. That was my major problem: how to obtain it. I now realize that this is, in fact, impossible for the ordinary man, but then I thought I had only to ask enough people to learn the great secret.&quot;" />
