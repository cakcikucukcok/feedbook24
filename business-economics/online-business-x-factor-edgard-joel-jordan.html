  <title>Online Business X Factor - Edgard Joel Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unearth The Minds Of Successful Internet Entrepreneurs From Around The Planet!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Working from home sounds like an ideal solution to them. Many of these dissatisfied souls will quit their jobs and plunge head-first into internet marketing with no preparation, no knowledge of what they are doing, no education, and no hope of success. Failure is their only option and they don&amp;rsquo;t even suspect.&lt;br /&gt;
The fact is that according to many sources, more than 90% (Ninety percent) of all Internet business start-ups end in failure within the first 120 (one hundred twenty) days. Yes, you read that right. NINETY PERCENT!&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, success is possible. There IS that other 10% (ten percent) that do succeed. The thing is success doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen by accident. And success isn&amp;rsquo;t just a crap shoot. Success happens because of some very important factors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Discover in this report how you may avoid joining the failing masses.&amp;nbsp;Inside this ebook, you will immediately learn the following information:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why Do So Many Internet Startups Fail Today?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How you can avoid being part of this dreadful statistic.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Key to Continuous Growth and Expansion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even if you are handicapped, know little about Internet Marketing, or low on resources, they are no legit excuses to not giving yourself a chance to succeed online.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Razor Edge Difference Between Work and Deals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What constitutes a fruitful task and something else either of less importance or simply a waste of time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And much more...&lt;/li&gt;
