  <title>They Don’t Teach You How To Get Rich At School-2 (1, #2) - Laura Maya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Debunk&amp;nbsp; all those assumptions that&amp;nbsp; you will be&amp;nbsp; Rich&amp;nbsp; if you study hard and work&amp;nbsp; hard .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;They Don&amp;rsquo;t Teach You How To Get Rich At S&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;chool-2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It is all about the importance of money.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The premise of the book clearly distinguishes the difference between the thinking of the rich and the poor. In essence, the only limitation between you and the rich is in your own mind, and achieving success lies in breaking these walls. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
You can&amp;#39;t just graduate and leave&amp;nbsp; formal&amp;nbsp; education&amp;nbsp; and expect yourself to be&amp;nbsp; financially well equipped. Many people think that having a&amp;nbsp; good education&amp;nbsp; is sufficient&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; the roads to acquire new wealth&amp;nbsp; , well they can&amp;#39;t be any more wrong! &amp;nbsp;It is having the mindset of the wealthy that will make you rich. That is why many lotto winners who becomes instant millionaires loses most of their money because they don&amp;#39;t have the proper mindset to maintain or grow their money.&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll discover why&amp;nbsp; some of your money beliefs might be wrong and&amp;nbsp; that could be holding you back , you&amp;nbsp; need to consider &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;what are the principles and what behaviors the rich have , that&amp;nbsp; you&amp;nbsp; do not have&lt;br /&gt;
Laura Maya takes this idea and breaks it into&amp;nbsp; sixteen chapters. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find a recipe to turn rich overnight. Rather, the book provides a solid foundation for setting the psychological stage for strong financial habits.&lt;br /&gt;
Studying hard, getting nice grades, and getting a job is not enough to be rich. That&amp;rsquo;s one lie which we have been fed with since our childhood. There is a difference between scholastic, professional and financial education. The book further analyzes the root cause of why you are not rich. It all boils down to your education. You were never taught about how to be rich at school. Forget that, you never even learned personal finance or how to handle money. It further touches upon how you can get smart with personal finance.&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps the biggest argument Laura makes is the fact that everything can change if you change your mindset. Buying that expensive dress, impulsive buying, etc. are all signs of a poor mentality. If you make changes to your lifestyle and spending habits today, you will reap the benefits tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
On making money, Laura&amp;rsquo;s approach is simple &amp;ndash; she emphasizes on investing, spend less, and plan for a long-term. This isn&amp;rsquo;t something new. We have all heard it. But we never implement it. Laura gives real life examples of how you can start your journey to being rich by investing for a long-term, planning your finances, and by staying on a budget. Last but not the least, she focuses on self-investment by developing your mental, financial, and emotional intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;
To sum up, Laura has come up with a book that truly focuses on the core problem today &amp;ndash; financial planning and money making is simply not taught at schools. The book truly provides a step by step guide to change your thinking about money, set realistic goals, and embark a journey towards riches." />
