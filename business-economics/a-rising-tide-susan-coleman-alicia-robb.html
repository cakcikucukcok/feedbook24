  <title>A Rising Tide - Susan Coleman, Alicia Robb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Women-owned firms represent an increasingly important segment of the small business sector. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 7.8 million women-owned firms in the United States in 2007, generating $1.2 trillion in revenues and providing employment for 7.6 million people. &lt;I&gt;A Rising Tide&lt;/I&gt; presents the financial strategies that have helped today&#39;s bold and creative women entrepreneurs to succeed.
The authors take a &quot;lifecycle approach&quot; in discussing the issues and strategies for different types of women-owned firms, from nascent and home-based firms to growth-oriented and technology-based enterprises. Each chapter includes real-world cases studies featuring women entrepreneurs as a way to bring the book&#39;s lessons to life.  
Uniquely, this book ties together the latest research on financing women-owned businesses and its implications for actual or potential entrepreneurs. Drawing on the Kauffman Firm Survey, a longitudinal survey of over 4,000 new firms, the authors are able to provide particularly useful conclusions, making this a must read for the thousands of women who are starting or may start businesses in the next few years.
