They offer new perspectives on how to spend your precious and limited resources, time, emotions, passions, and energy to generate the best results.&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-part process begins with a twenty-five-question self-assessment, then moves on to the Three Perspectives -- major life queries that focus on how you are perceived, your own self-image, and self-imposed limitations. The final step, the Seven Leverage Points, offers fresh insight into the choices you make and how you conduct yourself in business and in life. You will find immediately applicable tools to appraise and manage your work environment and personal gifts. You will be guided to make tiny but crucial shifts in getting needs met and drawing boundaries.&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leverage Your Best, Ditch the Rest&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;eliminates the stupid stuff that distracts you and gets in your way.
