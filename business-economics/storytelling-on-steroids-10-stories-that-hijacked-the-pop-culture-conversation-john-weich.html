  <title>Storytelling on Steroids: 10 Stories That Hijacked the Pop Culture Conversation - John Weich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Storytelling on Steroids will give even the most ad-hardened civilians a great insight into how the modern world works.&quot; WALLPAPER MAGAZINE &quot;Need to enhance your brand&#39;s performance? Take this steroid.&quot; ROB SCHWARTZ, GLOBAL CREATIVE PRESIDENT TBWA WORLDWIDE &quot;John Weich has written an exceptionally well crafted book that delves into the motivation, craft, timing, culture, mechanics and myths of modern storytelling. A must read for those looking to create and connect in this space.&quot; SUSAN BONDS, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, 42 ENTERTAINMENT As if out of nowhere, storytelling has become pop culture&#39;s favorite buzzword, and the communication industry&#39;s &#39;weapon&#39; of choice. In Storytelling on Steroids, editor and adman John Weich finds out why. Where did all this storytelling come from? Why are so many creative professionals suddenly so eager to spread the storytelling gospel? And who blazed the trail for an Age of Storytelling? In his compact, fast-moving book, Weich calls out countless pop culture darlings to make his case-Batman, Banksy, Tomb Raider, TED Talks, Radiohead, Jay-Z, BMW, to name but a few-and offers up 15 tips that will inspire you to find your own storytelling voice. For over two decades John Weich has toed the line between editorial and advertising. A former senior editor of pop culture publications like Wallpaper, 34 and ArtReview and a storyteller for brands like Starbucks, Nike, Heineken and Adidas, Weich occupies a unique industry position in his ability to link what brands want to say with what people actually want to hear." />
