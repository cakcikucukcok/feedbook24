&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1: Fast Trading with the Heikin Ashi chart&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scalping is the fastest way to make money in the stock market. There are no other methods that can increase the capital of a trader more effectively. To explain how this is so, the Germany based Heikin Ashi Trader tells all in this e-book, the first of a four-part series on scalping.&lt;br /&gt;
His method is very easy to understand and can be applied immediately because it is universal and works in all markets. To scalp, the Heikin Ashi Trader uses heikin ashi charts, which are a type of ancient Japanese chart that vividly depict the course of stock market prices. Heikin Ashi charts have the ability to visualize trends more clearly than the usual candlestick charts. In addition, they also show consolidation and reversal patterns earlier than any other chart representation.&lt;br /&gt;
This highly effective scalping strategy can be applied in very short time frame, as in the 1-minute chart as well as on higher time frames. You can trade with this universal method in equity indices and in the currency markets, but the most common instruments are futures or forex pairs.&lt;br /&gt;
