  <title>Master Your Mind - Roger Seip, Robb Zbierski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ll get there faster if you just slow down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Master Your Mind&lt;/i&gt; offers a bit of perspective and a lot of insight for anyone seeking long-term success. Success in business is spelled M-O-R-E: better results, faster growth, more revenue, greater efficiency. Do more. Make more. Achieve more. And do it now. Eventually, ambition turns to stress, then to frenzy, then to emptiness as once-ambitious workers endlessly trudge the hamster wheel chasing the next promotion. While top-level performance is the holy grail of business at all levels, there is another, much better way to achieve it: slow down. Yes, you read that right—S-L-O-W. This is your permission to jump off of the hamster wheel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slowing down is not a luxury, it is a necessity. A frenetic brain simply doesn’t perform at optimal levels. By maintaining a snail’s pace, you actually achieve better results—at rocket speed—because you’re firing on all cylinders. You’ll think of new things, approach old problems from new perspectives, and breathe a breath of fresh air into everything you do. This book shows you how to achieve this state of steady, sustainable fire, and how to get further by crawling than you ever did while attempting to fly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how slowing down can lead to better, faster results&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Achieve optimal performance thought patterns&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enhance your creativity and effectiveness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build energy, revenue, and good health in a self-sustaining way&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; you’re capable of more, but the stress is eating away at your body, your brain, and your soul. Relax, take a deep breath, and buckle down. Clear your mind, and then put it to work. Stop juggling and start doing. &lt;i&gt;Master Your Mind&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to supercharge your trajectory by taking it S-L-O-W. &lt;/p&gt;" />
