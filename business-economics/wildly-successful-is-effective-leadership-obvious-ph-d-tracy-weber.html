  <title>Wildly Successful: Is Effective Leadership Obvious? - Ph.D. Tracy Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;WILDLY SUCCESSFUL Solutions to Business Relationship Problems are Within Your Reach! Does your company waste time and resources on &amp;quot;fixes that fail&amp;quot; and promotional &amp;quot;flavors of the month&amp;quot; that do not provide sustainable, lasting, and transformational change? Wildly Successful, is a ground-breaking book written in the easy-to-read, easy-to-understand, style of a business fable - it even includes a sample of practical, doable group activities. The story integrates the training techniques developed by Kaleidoscope Learning Circle&amp;#39;s Dr. Tracy Weber designed to help you create a healthy, happy, and productive organization! We are introduced to the six horse management team of Carralot Carrot Company as they come nose-to-nose (literally) with the reality that the company is headed in the wrong direction. After a few moments of scrambling among themselves to determine who or what is responsible for this unacceptable turn of events, company CEO Tigg grabs the reins and vows to figure out how to straighten things out. Oh no! Other team members sense that the company&amp;#39;s current challenges are the result of a combination of Tigg&amp;#39;s overly task-focused leadership style and looking through a short-term, non-systemic organizational lens. Of course, mired in this dynamic, there is no easy way to point this out to the eager and over-confident Tigg. After instituting several tried-and-true (yet stale) strategies, Tigg is confident that the company is moving in the right direction. She is actually surprised when she realizes - it isn&amp;#39;t. Shortly thereafter, through her participation in a human-assisted learning experience (a play on equine-assisted learning), CEO Tigg becomes aware that she can leverage the best of both task-focused and relationship-focused leadership styles, crafting a culture that is supportive, nurturing, and highly effective! The enthusiasm in the room at the next management meeting is palpable - as each team member realizes what this change means to them and to the company - the aura of tension is replaced by a sense of relief, creativity, and innovation; new ideas begin to flow! The story is designed to help people identify and strengthen their organizational core - people, connection, and movement. The appendix of this book is a handy addition to the story, including three activities to get your company, organization, or group started on a healthy path through evaluating and dialoguing around eight key elements: leadership, knowledge structure, learning, communication, success, risk taking, goal setting, and organizational culture. Wildly Successful also features websites and resources to other thought-leaders who are experts in motivation, systems thinking, innovation, creativity, and more.
