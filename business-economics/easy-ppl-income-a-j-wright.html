  <title>Easy PPL Income - A.J. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My dear reader,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, I&amp;#39;d like to thank you very much for visiting my book page. It&amp;#39;s my belief that you will make back many times more than you&amp;#39;ve invested in this course in less than 24 hours if you act on what I&amp;#39;m about to reveal to you here.&lt;br /&gt;
Now you may be thinking, &amp;quot;Why do you feel so confident about this?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is simple. I want you to know that the techniques I&amp;#39;m about to show you are the very same ones I use for myself!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;This isn&amp;#39;t some theory or information you can find on Google or anywhere else for that matter that is never going to work. This is a tested and trusted practice that really works!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So be confident to grab a copy of my book!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve probably come across CPA (Cost Per Action) and know how it&amp;#39;s damn hard to get approved by the CPA networks. It&amp;#39;s sad to learn that some of the most popular CPA networks are no longer accepting new applicants. I know this because I was rejected many times myself and had a very tough time getting approved by them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s because of this I created this short but very powerful tutorial to teach you how to make money from PPL (Pay Per Lead).&lt;br /&gt;
