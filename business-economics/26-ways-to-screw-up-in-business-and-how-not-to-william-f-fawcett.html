  <title>26 Ways to Screw-Up in Business and How Not To - William F. Fawcett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="26 Ways To Screw-Up in Business and How Not To is a humorous, yet serious, business book. During a span of 50 years, the author discovered that there are 26 business commandments that you should never violate and if you do, its at your own risk. For example, Commandment # 4: Thou Shall Not Fish For Tunas in a Lake (never put probability before profitability). Commandment #8: Thou Shall Not Sell Texaco-Milk (problem with line-extensions). Commandment #18: Thou Shall Not Look Through a Keyhole With a Glass Eye (test, not guess). 
For nearly five decades Bill Fawcett  has worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs and small-business owners. He is convinced that 96% of business mistakes are a result of breaking one or more of the 26 commandants set forth in this guide-to-success. 
This book is not about managing people; its about managing oneself. The number one determinant of your success is you! Youre the quarterback who gets all the glory when you win and all the blame when you lose. What if you could reduce the number of turnovers and interceptions?  Wouldnt you want to know what mistakes you must avoid? Of course you would! This guide-to-success not only identifies what you must avoid; it offers prescriptions for doing it right." />
