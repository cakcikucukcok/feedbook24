  <title>Seaside Dream Home Besieged - Colour - T.G. Berlincourt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Captivated by the spectacular natural beauty of northern Californias
Mendocino coast, the author and his wife, Margie, residents of Virginia,
purchase a magnificent eleven-acre promontory high above the Pacific Ocean
near the remote village of Elk. On retiring years later, they decide to
build their dream home there. Seeking no more than whats sanctioned by
law, they nevertheless encounter fierce opposition from County and State
Parks officials, a hostile faction of Elk citizens, and the local media.
In a six-year battle that ignites civil war in the little village, Margie
and TG fight back. Well into the conflict they discover the hidden and
improper motivation behind much of the opposition. That paves the way for
a settlement with the County. But opponents promptly appeal the case to
the California Coastal Commission, and there the final showdown takes
place. Seaside Dream Home Besieged makes a clear and compelling case for
land-use reforms designed to achieve a more-just and more-harmonious
relationship between scenic preservation and property rights. Included are
extensive contending quotes from both sides of the conflict, providing
insight into the legal and ethical points at issue, as well as into local
coastal culture and obstructive human behavior. With its mystery,
sleuthing, assorted (non-lethal) casualties, and colorful real-life
scoundrels, Seaside Dream Home Besieged provides suspenseful and
entertaining reading. Moreover, its an indispensable guidebook for those
who dare to enter the land-use minefields in pursuit of a building permit." />
