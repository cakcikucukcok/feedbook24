  <title>Kick the Drink... Easily! - Jason Vale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no such thing as an alcoholic and there is no such disease as alcoholism! (as society understands it). Whether you agree with this statement or not, one thing is for sure, you will never see alcohol in the same light ever again after reading this book. Jason Vale takes an honest and hard hitting look at people&#39;s conceptions of our most widely consumed drug. Jason&#39;s major argument is there is no such thing as an &#39;alcoholic&#39; and that we are conditioned to accept alcohol as a &#39;normal&#39; substance in today&#39;s society despite the fact that it is the major cause of many of today&#39;s social problems and a wide range of health issues. This book is much more than a simple eye opener, it will: change the way you see alcohol forever; show you how to stop drinking; help you enjoy the process and enjoy your life so much more than you do now without having to drink alcohol. So open your mind and take a journey with Jason to explore the myths about the most used and accepted drug addiction in the world!" />
