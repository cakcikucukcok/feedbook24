  <title>Combat Investor - John Oharenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Turf.  Space.  Territory.  For thousands of years its been worth fighting for, sometimes at all costs.  Today, real estate remains one of the most coveted investment targets, and combat tactics are often necessary for financial victory.  
Real estate investing is financial, not military warfare.  In the investment battlefields winners build war chests through territorial expansion.  Losers retreat,  surrendering land holdings.  Military battles and real estate investing share the same goals and apply comparable techniques for building wealth and power.  Investors who understand and apply proven warfare principles to real estate investing become the ultimate financial warriorsCombat Investors. 
Combat investing shapes you into a personal weapons system -- an effective combination of your personal operating style, financial capacity, and risk tolerance. You deploy elements from your investment arsenal, acting like a jet fighter, a tank, a bomber, a helicopter, an aircraft carrier, or a submarine.  You know when to attack investments at close range (tank) or access hard-to-reach properties (helicopter).  Different targets with different swag.
Thats the beauty of combat investing, the blending of the warrior spirit with real estate smarts. No right answer or personal style, just the hunger to succeed.  Combat Investor:  Real Estate Investment Warfare Guide is written with this principle in mind, teaching you to become a financial land mind by:
	Honing your land-grabbing instincts
	Providing a formula for a successful war chest, with techniques on assessing capital risks, measuring your thirst for competitive battle, and identifying your individual combat investor style
	Targeting battlefields based upon locations and property types
	Training you to fight in current and future investment battlefronts according to proven military tactics for striking profitable targets
If youre starting to see real estate investing through the eyes of a warrior, then join the ranks of combat investors. Crack those knuckles and get going!" />
