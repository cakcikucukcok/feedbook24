      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A practical approach to difficult conversations in the workplace, with lots of real-life examples to keep the reader investing their time and - can you believe it? - it&#39;s actually fun to read.&quot; - Yvonne Mann, President, LeaderShifts &quot;Helpful, concrete examples written in practical lay terms. This book will help anyone who chooses to read it.&quot; - Chris Dragseth, Director (retired), Service Canada, Human Resources and Skills Development Difficult Conversations at Work: Go from &quot;Nightmare&quot; to &quot;No Problem&quot; As a former lawyer, Diane A. Ross thought she was a difficult conversations expert... so why was she still struggling through those dreaded &quot;tough talks&quot; with her coworkers and colleagues? So began her revelation: the communication skills that knocked &#39;em dead at the negotiating table were actually destructive to her workplace relationships. Conflicts went unresolved, productivity was stifled, and communication suffered - big time. Sound familiar? The Elephant in the Office: Super-Simple Strategies for Difficult Conversations at Work is the answer for anyone who has ever wrestled with managing difficult conversations in the workplace. It&#39;s full of real-life, easy-to-implement strategies that have stood the test of time. Diane A. Ross&#39; breezy writing style and upbeat sense of humor make this book a fun and informative read that promises to help you create real and lasting change in the workplace (so if you&#39;re looking for a dry, bore-me-to-tears-yawn-fest academic-style textbook, please look elsewhere!). Learn to: - Talk so that you are heard - Overcome the &quot;difficult conversation jitters&quot; - Disarm hostile coworkers - and even your boss - Boost communication within your team - Get what you want at work Handling Difficult Conversations Is About to Get a Whole Lot Less Scary/Stressful/Panic-Attack-Inducing If you have ever struggled with a coworker who wasn&#39;t pulling their weight or gotten butterflies asking for time off, this book is for you. If you have ever been faced with an unmotivated employee or a team leader who takes credit for your work, this book is for you. Whether you&#39;re dealing with a cubicle-mate with B.O., an employee stealing office supplies, a whole department getting laid off, or a team-member who always flies off the handle, The Elephant in the Office is going to get your difficult conversations moving in the right direction. Each chapter is full-to-overflowing with simple step-by-step tips backed by real-life examples, so you can see these strategies in action. Who Should Buy This Book? If you have ever had to cope with: - Anxiety asking for a raise or vacation time - Stress over having to fire someone, discuss employee performance, or give bad news - An overbearing boss - A coworker not pulling his or her weight - A smelly, dirty, crude, rude (or otherwise icky) team-member - Passive-aggressive, antagonistic, or just plain difficult coworkers or employees ...then you need this book! The Elephant in the Office is ideal for individuals hoping to achieve more in the workplace as well as executive teams and HR managers who want the very best from their employees. Handling difficult conversations is about to become a heck of a lot less painful, my friends! You&#39;re one good read away from better workplace dynamics, increased productivity, less stress, and more of what you want - out of work and out of life." />
