  <title>Summary: Build Your Own Garage - Bernd Schmitt and Laura Brown - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “BUILD YOUR OWN GARAGE: Blueprints and Tools to Unleash Your Company’s Hidden Creativity” by Bernd Schmitt and Laura Brown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bernd Schmitt is professor of business at Columbia Business School in New York and executive director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership. Laura Brown is a writer and business communication consultant based in New York City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garages are revered in business folklore as places where good ideas can be grown into new businesses. But it isn’t just start-ups that need a garage – every company actually needs an in-house garage where creative ideas can bubble to the surface if it aspires to be vibrant and successful in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Build Your Own Garage, Schmitt and Brown raise a question: “What’s the key to building and running a successful corporate garage?” Mostly, it’s hitting the right balance between the systems side of the business and the creative side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost every business organization has untapped reserves of creativity. The garage approach unleashes those reserves and provides a framework around which creative ideas can be turned into a sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short, build your own garage to become innovative, creative and profitable.&lt;br&gt;" />
