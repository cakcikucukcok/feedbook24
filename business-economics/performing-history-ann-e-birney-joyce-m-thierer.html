      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Performing History: How to Research, Write, Act, and Coach Historical Performance &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;addresses those areas that are of greatest challenge to novice historical performers. Historical performers must approach the process that is their work with a respect for both subject matter (the people who made the decisions that lead to what we call history) and for audiences, whatever the knowledge level they bring to the subject. That respect requires careful, on&amp;shy; going research (to wear the mantle of authority), while also recognizing that none of us will ever know everything there is to know (the mantle is lined with humility). It requires the crafting of stories that will interest targeted audiences, and the skill to tell those stories in a compelling manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Performing History &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is crafted for people who want to develop a first person narrative, those who have created a first person narrative but want to make it better, and those who want to help others develop first person narratives--museum and historic site volunteer coordinators, program and education curators, and, of course, those who wear many hats in small staffs. It is also for teachers, parents, and partners who are providing support for historical performers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
