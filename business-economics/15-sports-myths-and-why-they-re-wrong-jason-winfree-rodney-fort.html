  <title>15 Sports Myths and Why They’re Wrong - Jason Winfree, Rodney Fort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;I&gt;15 Sports Myths and Why They&#39;re Wrong&lt;/I&gt;, authors Rodney Fort and Jason Winfree apply sharp economic analysis to bust some of the most widespread urban legends about college and professional athletics.  
Each chapter takes apart a common misconception, showing how the assumptions behind it fail to add up. Fort and Winfree reveal how these myths perpetuate themselves and, ultimately, how they serve a handful of powerful parties—such as franchise owners, reporters, and players—at the expense of the larger community of sports fans. From the idea that team owners and managers are inept to the notion that revenue-generating college sports pay for athletics that don&#39;t attract fans (and their cash), &lt;I&gt;15 Sports Myths and Why They&#39;re Wrong&lt;/I&gt; strips down pervasive accounts of how our favorite games function, allowing us to look at them in a new, more informed way.
Fort and Winfree argue that substituting the intuitive appeal of emotionally charged myths with rigorous, informed explanations weakens the power of these tall tales and their tight hold on the sports we love. Readers will emerge with a clearer picture of the forces at work within the sports world and a better understanding of why these myths matter—and are worthy of a takedown." />
