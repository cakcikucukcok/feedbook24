  <title>Adama - Turki al-Hamad, Robin Bray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Turki al-Hamad&#39;s explosive novel Adama became an unlikely bestseller in the Middle East, selling more than 20,000 copies despite being officially banned in several countries, including the author&#39;s native Saudi Arabia. A compelling coming-of-age story, it also offers a rare and stunning inside look at the hidden roots of dissent in the modern Arab world. In his tranquil middle-class neighbourhood, eighteen-year-old Hisham doesn&#39;t quite fit in. He&#39;s a budding philosopher who spends his days reading banned books and developing his political ideals. His Saudi Arabia is a nation embroiled in internal conflict, torn between ancient tradition and newfound prosperity. Hisham finds himself caught up in the struggle for change, devoting more and more of his time to a shadowy group of dissenters even as he questions both their motives and methods. The result is an intense showdown between Hisham&#39;s love for his family, his firmly held philosophies, and his yearning for social justice. He awakens to passions both private and political, coming to grips with the paradoxes of a conservative land where illicit pleasures co-exist with the apparatus of a merciless state. &#39;I loved this book, which exposes the secrets of the inner and the outer life of the people of Saudi Arabia and made them vividly real to me; writing this book was a great act of courage.&#39; Maggie Gee &#39;Adama is not only a warm, funny and fascinating book, it is also a very brave one. It deserves to be read.&#39; The Times &#39;Al-Hamad has written a charming and involving coming-of-age tale. Always humane and often humourous, Adama has much to say about the foibles of the adolescent mind.&#39; Boyd Tonkin, Independent" />
