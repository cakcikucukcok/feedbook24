  <title>Talking the Walk: Should Ceos Think More About Sex? - Dr Julia Helene Ibbotson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can professional women &lt;b&gt;talk the walk&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, increasing numbers of women may aspire more and more to higher management positions. Indeed, todays young women expect promotional prospects in their chosen careers. But statistics show that they are not achieving the success they desire. The norm is still for womens progress in the workplace to be halted at junior management levels. Dr Julia Ibbotson, an academic, researcher and writer, looks at some of the reasons why and suggests ways of reversing this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, the author presents research evidence from a study which explores the issues of management communication from a gender perspective in secondary schools in the UK. It arose from a concern regarding the imbalance of men and women progressing to higher levels of management, as shown in the statistics published by the UKs Department for Education in a series of documents over 20 years. Current research also indicates that this picture has still not changed by 2011. So, what can be done to change it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence in this book looks at the possibility that there are gender differences in the way men and women managers talk in the workplace, which have the effect of undermining womens chances of promotion to higher leadership positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, do women talk the walk? And should CEOs think more carefully about the gender balance of their management and leadership teams so that they can create more effective working groups fit for the economic issues of the twenty first century recession and post-recession?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;b&gt;Talking the Walk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an excellent piece of work (Professor David Young)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a very talented teacher, writer and leading academic..positive and inspiring.. (Dr Deirdre Hughes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a lifetime of experience and insighta timely and ongoing challenge, a valid contribution to the debate (Professor Marie Parker-Jenkins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;invaluable to those wishing to challenge and transform the current management culturein a style that is accessible and engaging to the general reader (Professor Elaine Millard)&lt;/p&gt;
