  <title>Wealthy By Choice: Choosing Your Way to a Wealthier Future - Cfp Mba Davis Ilene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For over 30 years, as first a stockbroker and then a Certified Financial Planner&amp;reg; (often shown as CFP&amp;reg;), Ilene Davis has worked with clients with the underlying belief that Social Security, even combined with a pension, would not provide sufficient income for most of those clients to maintain their desired lifestyle for the rest of their life once they stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on that belief, her goal has been to help clients accumulate the personal assets (investments) they will likely need to &amp;ldquo;fill the gap&amp;rdquo; between what they expect to receive in Social Security and other retirement benefits, and the income they will need to afford their desired lifestyle should they be unable, or just not want, to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, to have enough in investments able to produce sufficient income on a regular, ongoing basis, or that could be sold and invested in investments that can reasonably be expected to produce income on a regular, ongoing basis to provide the income you would need to do what you want, when you want, with whom you want for the remainder of your life, without having to &amp;ldquo;work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
