  <title>Baby, One More Time - Esme Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Heat up your Valentine&#39;s with the Unlocked Collection&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cass has spent a long time trying to get over her first love Nick. But when they run into each other in the airport and end up on the same flight to New York, the chemistry between them is off the chart. But there is something that Cass is holding back. Will Cass finally get her revenge on the boy who broke her heart?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Esme Taylor spends her days dreaming about romantic scenarios (lately involving Benedict Cumberbatch, but subject to change) and is thrilled to have the opportunity to write them down. She&#39;s been writing fiction since she was a teen (romantic scenarios featuring George Michael), but didn&#39;t finish a novel until 2004 (romantic scenario featuring a thinly-disguised Matt Damon). She lives in Lancashire with her husband (looks a bit like Christopher Eccleston) and two children and is the author of three YA novels under her own name, Keris Stainton.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
