  <title>Good Charts for Persuasive Presentations - Scott Berinato, Nancy Duarte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The right visual revealed at the right time can turn an unremarkable presentation into a resonant, emotional experience. This two-book collection provides you with the tools you need to craft and deliver presentations that will impress your audience, increase your influence in your organization, and advance your career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good Charts: The HBR Guide to Making Smarter, More Persuasive Data Visualizations&lt;/b&gt; shows how a good visualization can communicate the nature and potential impact of information and ideas more powerfully than any other form of communication. For a long time &quot;dataviz&quot; was left to specialists--data scientists and professional designers. No longer. A new generation of tools and massive amounts of available data make it easy for anyone to create visualizations that communicate ideas far more effectively than generic spreadsheet charts ever could. What&#39;s more, building good charts is quickly becoming a need-to-have skill for managers. If you&#39;re not doing it, other managers are, and they&#39;re getting noticed for it and getting credit for contributing to your company&#39;s success. In &lt;i&gt;Good Charts&lt;/i&gt;, dataviz maven Scott Berinato provides an essential guide to how visualization works and how to use this new language to impress and persuade. Dataviz today is where spreadsheets and word processors were in the early 1980s—on the cusp of changing how we work. Berinato lays out a system for thinking visually and building better charts through a process of talking, sketching, and prototyping. This book is much more than a set of static rules for making visualizations. It taps into both well-established and cutting-edge research in visual perception and neuroscience, as well as the emerging field of visualization science, to explore why good charts (and bad ones) create &quot;feelings behind our eyes.&quot; Along the way, Berinato also includes many engaging vignettes of dataviz pros, illustrating the ideas in practice. &lt;i&gt;Good Charts&lt;/i&gt; will help you turn plain, uninspiring charts that merely present information into smart, effective visualizations that powerfully convey ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HBR Guide to Persuasive Presentations&lt;/b&gt; will teach you to how to take the pain out of presentations. Terrified of speaking in front of a group? Or simply looking to polish your skills? No matter where you are on the spectrum, this guide will give you the confidence and the tools you need to get results. Written by presentation expert Nancy Duarte, the &lt;i&gt;HBR Guide to Persuasive Presentations&lt;/i&gt; will help you: (1) Win over tough crowds, (2) Organize a coherent narrative, (3) Create powerful messages and visuals, (4) Connect with and engage your audience, (5) Show people why your ideas matter to them, and (6) Strike the right tone, in any situation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
