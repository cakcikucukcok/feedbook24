  <title>Rethinking Utility Customer Care: Satisfying Your Always-Connected, Always-On Customers - Todd W. Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is your customer care ready for our connected world?  Ubiquitous digital communication has created a customer that&#39;s always connected, always on. Utilities are adopting digital communication to connect to the grid, the meter, and the customer. Rethinking Utility Customer Care examines the convergence of these two trends-the &quot;smart customer&quot; with smart energy-revealing the implications, challenges, and opportunities for utility customer service.    In this provocative guide, you&#39;ll discover:  •	How digital connectivity is disrupting traditional utility customer service models and the creative solutions required to remain current. •	Effective strategies for engaging your digitally connected customer. •	The new prerequisites for service excellence in a digital world and how to achieve them. •	A road map to transform your customer care and avoid irrelevancy in the competition for the customer relationship. •	How to turn your CSRs into customer service &quot;resolutionaries.&quot;  Utilities have done such a great job of delivering reliable, safe, affordable, and convenient energy that they have become back-of-mind and taken for granted. The result is a practically nonexistent relationship with the customer. Today&#39;s always-connected, always-on consumers demand much more from companies. It&#39;s time to rethink utility customer care and harness the tremendous opportunities these connected technologies present to engage the new-energy consumer and create high-value relationships." />
