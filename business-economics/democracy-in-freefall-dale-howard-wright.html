  <title>Democracy in Freefall - Dale Howard Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Past presidents and years of self-serving Congressmen have brought our once great country to the threshold of moral decay and financial ruin. Leading economists warn that the country has only eight to ten years before we enter bankruptcy. When this happens, our money will lose its value in the international market place. As we move into a non-recoverable depression, we may even see figures of 80% or more unemployment. There will be no retirement checks. And, brutal gangs will control out city streets. The only chance that we have to survive is to rid ourselves of the representatives now in office. 
The author is forming a new non-political party called We the People Party. This party will be the voice of the people. When the people speak, the new movement will act in support of their mandate. With 230 million unhappy voters in this country, never before has there been a better time to sweep the two major parties from office. 
Read on to find out how we will get the votes to sweep the 2012 elections.
The author also shows how we can restore fiscal control to the government, repeal most taxes and create thousands of meaningful skilled jobs for our weak economy. 
Additionally, the author takes a new hardline approach on criminals and the Criminal Justice system in America." />
