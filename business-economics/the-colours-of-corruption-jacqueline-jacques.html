  <title>The Colours of Corruption - Jacqueline Jacques</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1893: Mary, a desperately poor cleaner, is a witness to murder. Archie, one of the first artists to work for the police, to support his other work, draws the man she says she saw at the scene. Fascinated by her &#39;face full of bones&#39;, he persuades her to sit for a portrait, but the man who buys the picture really wants to buy Mary. When he realises he&#39;s betrayed her, Archie takes her to hide with his friends, but doesn&#39;t realise what he&#39;s started. He has no idea how this one woman links his wealthiest clients, the poorest slums, terrible secrets, and a violent thug who is now looking for Archie - the man Mary described to the police. As this gripping thriller uncoils, Jacqueline Jacques paints an intricate, vibrant picture of the layers of Victorian London, where the poor are commodities, criminals have nothing to lose and the rich can buy anything. And the murders go on...1893: Mary, a desperately poor cleaner, is a witness to murder.
