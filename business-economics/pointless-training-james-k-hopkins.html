  <title>Pointless Training - James K. Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is your training a series of pointless events? What do employees say about your training efforts? Do they long for more information, different skills, or a more engaging environment for learning? While we never set out to develop pointless training solutions, pointless workshops, or an entire pointless training department, it sadly happens way too often. And each time it does happen, it makes a turnaround that much harder to implement.
This book discusses the big skill areas that most companies should be developing in their employees and how to make a purposeful impact and avoid pointless processes. You, no doubt, will recognize times you have experienced or implemented pointless training yourself. But while recognizing pointless training is step one, the real learning comes from understanding what you can do differently going forward.
In his first book, The Training Physical: Diagnose, Treat and Cure Your Training Department, Jim Hopkins explored what it takes to have and maintain a healthy training function. In this book, he continues his training philosophy using similar medical analogies to draw the reader into a quick understanding of how to engage learning and, where employees are applauding the training function, learning applicable skills and increasing the effectiveness of the company. Like a bandage on a cut, it has its purpose when used appropriately. But when the cut needs stitches, it is pointless to use a bandage.
Are you ready to develop purposeful training solutions and avoid pointless training from now on?" />
