  <title>The Nigerian Electric Power Sector - Ayodele Oni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hitherto, industry participants and professionals have had to navigate the emerging and complex Nigerian electricity supply industry (the power sector) without materials or texts that adequately and comprehensively address the history and policy issues, as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks of the industry. In particular, before this book, there was no book written from a practical and hands-on perspective on the key issues connected with the Nigerian power sector or Nigerian power projects generally; neither was there a book that provided good and practical insights on matters related to the negotiation of power sector transaction documents in Nigeria. The few available texts covered only limited aspects of the power sector as none covered multiple key issues.
This 400 page book consisting of 10 chapters, attempts to fill the lacuna. It reviews the general legal and regulatory regime of the power sector. It also takes a comprehensive look at the power sector from a historical dimension and looks at where Nigeria is, in terms of the legal and regulatory regime, and the direction in which the country may be headed. Of particular interest to power sector professionals and other persons who negotiate contracts in the power sector or contracts related to the development of power projects, is the chapter which serves as a guide on negotiating key power sector contracts, such as Power Purchase Agreements, Gas Supply Agreements and Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contracts.  
Noteworthy, is the fact that the book contains contributions from internationally recognized energy law and policy experts like Stella Duru of Banwo &amp; Ighodalo, Jason Kerr of White &amp; Case, Arun Velusami of Norton Rose and Akshai Fofaria of Pinsent Masons. 
Further, the book considers other issues in the power sector, such as the Partial Risk Guarantee, which backstops the Federal Government of Nigerias payment obligations to power generation companies; and pricing issues." />
