  <title>The Digital Marketing Internet Toolkit - Raymond Wayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Remember the famous clause &amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;Earning Money While in Pajamas&lt;/b&gt; !&lt;br /&gt;
Many of us got into digital internet&amp;nbsp; marketing thinking it was going to improve our lives in major ways.&lt;br /&gt;
You may even feel that you were &amp;lsquo;promised&amp;rsquo; by internet marketing gurus that your life would suddenly be easy once you took up this line of work.&lt;br /&gt;
Digital Internet&amp;nbsp; marketing means working online and that in turn means working from anywhere, and without a boss. The only problem is that very few people have any idea what makes the web tick. People tell me they want to start their own business selling crafts, or they tell me that they want to start blogging for fun but they have zero clue what that entails.&lt;br /&gt;
So of course, life will be easy! You can choose your own hours; you can work out of coffee shops or from beautiful locations&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And you can do it all your own way without someone breathing down your neck and shouting at you when you get things wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s more, if you manage to achieve a &amp;lsquo;passive income&amp;rsquo;, then you&amp;rsquo;ll be earning money even while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
Passive income means generating cash from a websites, or from &amp;nbsp;YouTube channels, or through affiliate sales but even if you know the &lt;i&gt;basics &lt;/i&gt;of internet marketing, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that you don&amp;rsquo;t have all of the advanced skills you need to really make any project into a success.&lt;br /&gt;
It means that even as you are resting, the seeds you sowed &amp;nbsp;may&amp;nbsp; either fail&amp;nbsp; or it might &amp;nbsp;continue to to grow&amp;nbsp; and waiting for you reap the &amp;nbsp;rewards.&lt;br /&gt;
Well we are not saying its not True , some does &amp;nbsp;hits the roof with the right digital product launch at the right&amp;nbsp; time with the right content&amp;nbsp; to the right&amp;nbsp; audience but&amp;nbsp; likewise some drown&amp;nbsp; in their couch&amp;nbsp; but the most important&amp;nbsp; is whether&amp;nbsp; you do it&amp;nbsp; the most efficient&amp;nbsp; and healthy way . ?&lt;br /&gt;
To make it easy, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a step-by-step guide that will show you exactly how it&amp;rsquo;s done...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Digital Marketing Internet Toolkit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Learn the basics of internet marketing 101 even if you have no prior experience.&lt;br /&gt;
-&amp;nbsp;Learn how to turn any idea or concept into a reality.&lt;br /&gt;
- You are going to learn how to prevent yourself from going entirely mad when you work from home.&lt;br /&gt;
-&amp;nbsp;It will guide&amp;nbsp; on&amp;nbsp; new trending methods of internet marketing&lt;br /&gt;
- You are going to learn how to manage your finances, knowing that you&amp;rsquo;re going to have different amounts of money coming in at different times.&lt;br /&gt;
- You will know if you have what it takes to make your own taxes.&lt;br /&gt;
- Learn tools that will make you &lt;i&gt;immensely &lt;/i&gt;employable, to the point that you are never without work.&lt;br /&gt;
And the list goes on and on&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
You will learn skills here that will put you head and shoulders above the competition:&lt;br /&gt;
How to not rely on Google Ads to make money from a website&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to keep 100% of the profits from your website earnings&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to optimize a website, article or both for search engines.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How to build long-time fans and followers&lt;br /&gt;
You will later see how the ability to work online can allow pretty much any of your wildest dreams and plans to come true&amp;hellip;" />
