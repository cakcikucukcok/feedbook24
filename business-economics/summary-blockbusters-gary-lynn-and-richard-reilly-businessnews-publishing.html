  <title>Summary: Blockbusters - Gary Lynn and Richard Reilly - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;BLOCKBUSTERS: The Five Keys to Developing Great New Products&quot; by Gary Lynn and Richard Reilly.&lt;br&gt;Gary Lynn and Richard Reilly are both professors at the Stevens Institute of Technology. Lynn specializes in product design and new product launches. Reilly is a recognized authority on individual and team assessments. &lt;br&gt;In Blockbusters, they argue that &quot;great companies succeed and endure because they continually produce great products. (…) To produce real value, companies must develop and launch great, blockbuster products&quot;.&lt;br&gt;A 10-year research program found five best practices for developing great new products. &lt;br&gt;&quot;We believe that if your team excels at these five practices, its probability of failure is virtually zero. That’s our promise, and it’s a promise that we have demonstrated statistically. (…) It is about creating a blockbuster new product that knocks your competitor out of the box, sets a new standard for your industry, and possibly creates a new product category. The five essential practices can help you launch one – not a family of them, just one – blockbuster product per division.&quot;&lt;br&gt;If you wish to learn how to develop blockbuster products, Blockbusters is the book you need." />
