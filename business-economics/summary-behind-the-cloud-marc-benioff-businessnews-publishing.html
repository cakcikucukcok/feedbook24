  <title>Summary: Behind the Cloud - Marc Benioff - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;BEHIND THE CLOUD: The Untold Story of How Salesforce.com Went from Idea to Billion-Dollar Company – and Revolutionized an Industry&quot; by Marc Benioff.&lt;br&gt;Marc Benioff founded Salesforce.com in 1999 and currently serves as chairman and CEO of that company. Salesforce.com is a leader in enterprise cloud computing and has received a Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Award. &lt;br&gt;In Behind The Cloud, Marc Benioff explains how he grew his own billion-dollar company.&lt;br&gt;&quot;The future wasn’t about simply improving on what was already done; it was about being bold enough to make big, sweeping, dramatic changes. With those ideas in mind, I started Salesforce.com with a mission to do enterprise software differently. We wanted to take advantage of a new platform – the Internet – to deliver business applications cheaply through a Web site that was as easy to use as Amazon.com.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Now, ten years later, our small company is a big one. The few initial employees who gave Salesforce.com everything have grown into a few thousand employees. Revenue has escalated to more than $1 billion a year.&quot;&lt;br&gt;In Behind The Cloud, Marc Benioff demonstrates how you can successfully develop your company to becoming a billion-dollar company." />
