  <title>How Safe Is Our Investment - Paul Okoye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adam Smith once said, It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. Consciously or unconsciously Adam Smith revealed the unseen fingers that drive every human activity. 
A critical analysis of the causes and effects of the current economic and financial crisis extols how devastating self-interest can be to investment and its environment. Because of the interconnectedness of the global economic and financial system, there is no longer a separate economy. How Safe Is Our Investment? takes a global view of the causes of the failure of investment and its implication from an economic, political, social, and legal viewpoint.
The worlds debt has continued to rise without prospect for repayment, and in the wrong application of Keyness theory, world leaders have continued to increase the world debt. Unfortunately, because of the lack of will and moral decadence of the leaders and the present generation, succeeding generations will have to inherit the burden of debt they knew nothing aboutunless we take action now to reverse this trend. This book explains how to turn this around." />
