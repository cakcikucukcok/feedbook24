&amp;ldquo;How to recruit an army of affiliates who are just waiting to promote your product! Blah blah blah.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Did that headline look familiar? One of the myths about getting affiliates to promote your products is that they&amp;#39;re just out there waiting for you to call them to go to work. No such luck. Affiliates are hit with a lot of different offers to promote &amp;ndash; and the better the affiliate, the more offers they receive.&lt;br /&gt;
So how do you find and recruit good affiliates? We&amp;#39;ll cover that in detail. First, let me share...&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet marketing community will tell you it&amp;#39;s super easy to get affiliates. Not true. The reality is that it&amp;#39;s work. But that&amp;#39;s also good news for you because 99 out of 100 product owners either won&amp;#39;t bother with the work or they won&amp;#39;t know what to do to get affiliates. That&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;ll enjoy a distinct advantage over them by the time you finish this article.&lt;br /&gt;
To get affiliates, you&amp;#39;ll need to convince them that you and your product are worth promoting. You&amp;#39;ll need to build trust. And you&amp;#39;ll need patience as well. Potential affiliates often won&amp;#39;t say yes the first time you ask, or they&amp;#39;ll say yes but then they&amp;#39;ll get distracted and they&amp;#39;ll go promote something else unless you follow up." />
