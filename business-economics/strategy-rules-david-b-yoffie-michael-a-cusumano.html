  <title>Strategy Rules - David B. Yoffie, Michael A. Cusumano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The authors of the bestselling &lt;em&gt;Competing on Internet Time&lt;/em&gt; (a &lt;em&gt;Business Week&lt;/em&gt; top 10 book) analyze the strategies, principles, and skills of three of the most successful and influential figures in business&amp;#8212;Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Steve Jobs&amp;#8212;offering lessons for all managers and entrepreneurs on leadership, strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Andy Grove founded three companies that would define the world of technology and transform our lives. At their peaks, Microsoft, Apple, and Intel were collectively worth some $1.5 trillion. &lt;em&gt;Strategy Rules&lt;/em&gt; examines these three individuals collectively for the first time&amp;#8212;their successes and failures, commonalities and differences&amp;#8212;revealing the business strategies and practices they pioneered while building their firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David B. Yoffie and Michael A. Cusumano have studied these three leaders and their companies for more than thirty years, while teaching business strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship at Harvard and MIT. In this enlightening guide, they show how Gates, Grove, and Jobs approached strategy and execution in remarkably similar ways&amp;#8212;yet markedly differently from their erstwhile competitors&amp;#8212;keeping their focus on five strategic rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategy Rules&lt;/em&gt; brings together the best practices in strategic management and high-tech entrepreneurship from three path-breaking entrepreneurs who emerged as CEOs of huge global companies. Their approaches to formulating strategy and building organizations offer unique insights for start-up executives as well as the heads of modern multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
