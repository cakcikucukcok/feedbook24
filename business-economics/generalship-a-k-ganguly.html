  <title>Generalship - A K Ganguly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Generals have made and changed the history of many nations. Armed Forces are the instrument of power of any nation and Generals have important role to play in the nation building and national security. Lately, the standard of Generalship has come to be criticised and the environment alleges that mediocre Generals are being thrown up, and in the process competency and professionalism is getting sacrificed. Not only the Indian Armed Forces, but most of the world armies are facing this problem and mediocrity attributes to poor Generalship. 
The book covers the aspects of what really matters in professional Generalship, what are the expectations from the Generals, what abilities the Generals must have which matters in professional command and what are the attitude and personality factors which Generals must up hold to make themselves credible and effective.
The chapters have covered those essential perquisites which make a difference in command of a military formation and differentiate between mediocre/poor and good Generalship. Not only in military affairs but dealing with the outside world is an important part of Generalship attributes and here what matters is prudence in the outlook and professionalism. The issues discussed in the book also have relevance in the corporate and industrial sectors. 
Written in a simple and lucid manner, use of quotations and references have been made to highlight the importance of issues being discussed thus making the narrative interesting." />
