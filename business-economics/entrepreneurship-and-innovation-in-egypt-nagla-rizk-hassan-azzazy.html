  <title>Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Egypt - Nagla Rizk, Hassan Azzazy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Entrepreneurship and innovation have emerged globally as significant drivers for inclusive economic growth, contributing to both job and wealth creation. Especially since Egypt&#39;s 2011 revolution, the need has become pressing for novel models that capitalize on the country&#39;s human resources. Half of the Egyptian population is less than 25 years old and almost one quarter is between 18 and 29 years old. More than any other time, an entrepreneurial spirit and innovative mindset need to be fostered and encouraged to best rebuild the country&#39;s economy on solid and sustainable foundations.
This important book sheds new light on the promise of entrepreneurship and innovation in restructuring Egypt, and their potential for promoting economic development. It probes the relationship between innovation and economic growth, providing linkages between academic research and applied/industry needs. It also looks at how creativity and innovation can be embedded in the educational system, the challenges facing the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and considers ways to enhance social entrepreneurship.
Covering a lot of ground, the authors propose answers and solutions, as well as laying the groundwork for further research and deliberations-in this field in general and in Egypt, at this juncture of the country&#39;s development, in particular." />
