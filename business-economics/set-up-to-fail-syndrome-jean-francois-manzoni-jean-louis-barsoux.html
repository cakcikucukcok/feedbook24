  <title>Set-up-to-Fail Syndrome - Jean-Francois Manzoni, Jean-Louis Barsoux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Do you have an employee whose performance keeps deteriorating&amp;#151;despite your close monitoring? Brace yourself: You may be at fault&amp;#151;by unknowingly triggering the set-up-to-fail syndrome. Perhaps things started off swimmingly. But then something--a missed deadline, a lost client&amp;#151;made you question the person&#39;s performance. You began micromanaging him. Suspecting your reduced confidence, he started doubting himself&amp;#151;and stopped giving his best. You viewed his new behavior as additional proof of mediocrity, and tightened the screws further. In &lt;I&gt;The Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome&lt;/I&gt;, Jean-Francois Manzoni and Jean-Louis Barsoux show how this insidious cycle hurts everyone: employees stop volunteering ideas, preventing your organization from getting the most from them; you lose energy to attend to other activities; and your reputation suffers as other employees deem you unfair. Team spirit wilts as targeted performers are alienated. But the set-up-to-fail syndrome doesn&#39;t have to happen. The authors provide preventive measures, such as loosening the reins as new employees master their jobs. If the syndrome has already erupted, Manzoni and Barsoux explain how to discuss the dynamic with your employee and reverse the cycle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
