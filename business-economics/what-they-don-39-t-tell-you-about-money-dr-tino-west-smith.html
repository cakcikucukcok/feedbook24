  <title>What They Don&#39;t Tell You About Money - Dr. Tino West Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book about new beginnings and fresh paths for those who are truly &quot;at the end of themselves&quot; and are ready to follow a higher wisdom. A wisdom that will not support get rich quick schemes, laziness, slothfulness, or being a sluggard my favorite text on this subject is from Proverbs 6:6 where the author encourages the reader to consider the ways of an ant. &quot;Go to the ant, thou sluggard: consider her ways, and be wise:&quot;&lt;P&gt;
This book will not encourage the selling of drugs or any other illegal means of making it. Yes I have heard many times the question, &quot;why work for McDonalds at minimum wage when you can make so much more dealing drugs?&quot; because it is wrong, and is not apart of our Nguzo Saba African Value System: UMOJA (Unity) To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.&lt;P&gt; 
	It will give you an eye-opening account of my expertise, sensitivity, and straight talk. A person who reads this book will be able to learn from my past mistakes, receive knowledge that you sometimes dont learn in college, and be able to overcome and deal with your financial crises." />
