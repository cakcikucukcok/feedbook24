  <title>Making Sense of Strategy - Tony Manning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Worldwide, business faces daunting challenges. Competition in every industry is increasingly hostile. The operating environment is increasingly complex. And the cost of missteps and lost opportunities is rising. In this new arena, strategic planning is more important than ever and the ability to turn plans into action - fast - is critical to success. Yet most management tools were designed for a different age, and most change efforts fail. Making Sense of Strategy is a handbook for every business person in the new century. It provides a proven, practical way to think about what&#39;s happening around you and to create an effective strategy for the future. Based on the simple idea that organizations are &quot;managed conversations,&quot; it builds on the latest thinking from many fields to offer a breakthrough approach to delivering consistent growth and profits.  Written by a top consultant, Making Sense of Strategy cuts through the clutter of management fads and gives you a systematic and disciplined way to create a winning profit recipe, define your priorities, and motivate your team to action." />
