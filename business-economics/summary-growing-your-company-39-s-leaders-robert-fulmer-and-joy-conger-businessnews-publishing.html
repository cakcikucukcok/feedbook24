      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “GROWING YOUR COMPANY’S LEADERS: How Great Organizations Use Succession Management To Sustain Competitive Advantage” by Robert Fulmer and Jay Conger.&lt;br&gt;Robert Fulmer is academic director for Duke Corporation and a visiting professor at Pepperdine University. He is widely regarded as an expert in business leadership. He specializes on future management challenges, strategy implementation and leadership development. Jay Conger is professor of organizational behavior at the London School of Business and a senior research scientists at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles’s Center for Effective Organizations. &lt;br&gt;Due to the fact it is now commonplace for executives to change from one organization to another during their careers, succession management has moved from the background into headline status. What was once an issue of interest only to the human resources&lt;br&gt;department is now a potential source of competitive advantage for organizations large and small. Quite simply, whoever can win the war for executive talent stands the best chance of prospering in the future.&lt;br&gt;In this excellent guide, Fulmer and Conger explore the seven key elements of a robust succession management system. Peppered with dozens of examples, Growing Your Company’s Leaders is an easy-to-read and well-researched book.&lt;br&gt;" />
