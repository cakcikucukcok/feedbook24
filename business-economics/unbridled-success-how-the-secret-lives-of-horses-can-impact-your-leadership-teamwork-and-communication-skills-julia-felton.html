  <title>Unbridled Success: How the secret lives of horses can impact your leadership, teamwork and communication skills - Julia Felton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Unbridled Success Julia Felton shares the profound life and business lessons that horses have taught her. Through her candid story telling she provides insights into how horses can help us become more self-aware and connected to ourselves and others. The result is improved leadership skills, as she reveals that leadership is an earned position based on trust and respect. This provides a refreshing departure from the idea that leaders are always the dominant one. Unbridled Success also clearly reveals that Horse Assisted Coaching is not just some fad, but a really profound way for both individuals and teams to engage in experiential full body learning. Learning that will never be forgotten and that has a systemic change on individuals and organisations. At a time when training budgets are under pressure investing in innovative programmes that deliver demonstrable and measurable change is a cost effective alternative to traditional classroom learning. The book challenges us to leave our comfort zone and try something new so that we can expand and develop and see things from a new perspective." />
