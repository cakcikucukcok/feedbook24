  <title>The American Dream Declassified - Frank Pn Adjei-Mensah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A must-read, insightful blueprint to fulfilling your dreams and potentials of becoming financially emancipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a culmination of 4 years of extensive and meticulous research to uncover why some people do so well in the capitalist economy while the vast majority struggle to make ends meet. My quest was to discover answers to these elusive questions about the few who are doing so handsomely well: What do they know? What do they do differently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research results were a total shock to my very core. I simply could not believe how uncomplicated it really is to create wealth and live the American Dream. For lack of knowledge my people perish.---Hosea 4:6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education is THE KEY to success in any endeavor. Financial Education is THE KEY to financial success, and in the current globalized economic environment, everyone needs that in addition to their degrees, diplomas, and professional training. That need is essential and cardinal now than ever before. This book provides the entire Financial Education package, which would help readers expand their means rather than just managing their current, often meagre means, in an easy-to understand step-by-step approach towards Financial Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
