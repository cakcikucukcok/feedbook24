  <title>Rock Your Business - Boni Wagner-Stafford, John Wagner-Stafford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hate being told what to do? Uh-huh. Us too. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re in business for ourselves and we live on a sailboat. So we can do whatever the *#4&amp;amp; we want. Which is how we learned a ton of great stuff about starting a business. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Now we&amp;rsquo;re passing that great stuff on to you. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Some people pay thousands of dollars to attend business school. Nothing wrong with that, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re the just-want-to-get-started kind of person, we&amp;rsquo;ve got what you need to Rock Your Business. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not all fun and games. But it is all real. Real life, that is. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
We share stories of what we&amp;rsquo;ve done. Even if it ain&amp;rsquo;t pretty. Some lessons are just messy, right? We also interviewed nearly two dozen other business startup rock stars and share their wisdom with you too. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Curious about defining your purpose? Check. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to explore options for your business structure? Check. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Wonder why people are always telling you to consult a lawyer for that? Check. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Think intellectual property is the sprawling estate of Bill Gates? We&amp;rsquo;ll set you straight. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to know how soon you can start hiring other people to do the stuff you hate? Check. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
What exactly is all the fuss about cash flow? Check chapter 11. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, and want to ditch the customers that drive you crazy? You go right ahead. We&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
How do we know all this stuff? We&amp;rsquo;re a go-getting team made up of an award-winning former journalist and life-long serial entrepreneur. We like to try different things, learn about them, master them and move on. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Did we mention we live on our sailboat? Yup. It&amp;rsquo;s where we wrote Rock Your Business. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Are you ready? &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Written in a bright, accessible fashion and delivers information that small business people will run with. They provide clear advice on how to improve the way you do business.&amp;quot; - Troy Media&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Terrific book and a MUST READ for anyone who wants to start their own business, or already has&amp;hellip; there is such great insight and valuable information here, you&amp;rsquo;d be a fool not to give it a quick read.&amp;quot; - (5 Stars) Jenna Brewster&amp;mdash;Goodreads; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble; Indie Book Reviewers&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Great narrative that is personable, knowledgeable and easily understood, this book is a useful guide that is a must read for anyone considering starting their own business.&amp;quot; Recommend. (5 stars) Gillian Hancock&amp;mdash;Goodreads; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble; Indie Book Reviewers &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A highly recommended read that can help you to better understand the many issues with running your own business.&amp;quot; (4-5 stars) Laura Clarke&amp;mdash;Goodreads; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble; Indie Book Reviewers&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nothing teaches quite like experience so to hear it all broken down by someone who has &amp;lsquo;been there, done that&amp;rsquo; is really invaluable help for any business owner, regardless of how long they&amp;rsquo;ve been at it. This book is a great tool for anyone to have.&amp;quot; (4 stars) Cody Brighton&amp;mdash; Goodreads; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble; Indie Book Reviewers&lt;/p&gt;" />
