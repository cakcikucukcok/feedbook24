  <title>Effective Copywriting Techniques: The Ads That Sell - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it something to be regarded as a work of beauty or art? Is it clever slogans or amusing prose? Or is it workmanship to be judged for an award or recognition? It&#39;s none of the above.  Advertising is salesmanship multiplied. Nothing more. And advertising copy, or copywriting, is salesmanship in print. The purpose of a copywriter&#39;s job is to sell. Period.   The selling is accomplished by persuasion with the written word, much like a television commercial sells (if done properly) by persuading with visuals and audio.  So it stands to reason that knowing some basic rules or techniques about writing effective copy is in order. Test results will always trump everything, but it&#39;s better to have a starting point before you test.  So this starting point is the essence of this book.  The tips expressed here have been generally time-tested and known to be effective." />
