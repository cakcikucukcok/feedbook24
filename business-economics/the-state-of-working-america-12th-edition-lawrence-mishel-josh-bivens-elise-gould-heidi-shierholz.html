  <title>The State of Working America, 12th Edition - Lawrence Mishel, Josh Bivens, Elise Gould, Heidi Shierholz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Since 1988, &lt;em&gt;The State of Working America&lt;/em&gt; has provided a comprehensive answer to a question newly in vogue in this age of Occupy Wall Street: To what extent has overall economic growth translated into rising living standards for the vast majority of American workers and their families? In the 12th edition, Lawrence Mishel, Josh Bivens, Elise Gould, and Heidi Shierholz analyze a trove of data on income, jobs, mobility, poverty, wages, and wealth to demonstrate that rising economic inequality over the past three decades has decoupled overall economic growth from growth in the living standards of the vast majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new edition of &lt;em&gt;The State of Working America&lt;/em&gt; also expands on this analysis of American living standards, most notably by placing the Great Recession in historical context. The severe economic downturn that began in December 2007 came on the heels of a historically weak recovery following the 2001 recession, a recovery that saw many measures of living standards stagnate. The authors view the past decade as &quot;lost&quot; in terms of living standards growth, and warn that millions of American households face another decade of lost opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Especially troubling, the authors stress, is that while overall economic performance in the decades before the Great Recession was more than sufficient to broadly raise living standards, broad-based growth was blocked by rising inequality driven largely by policy choices. A determinedly data-driven narrative, &lt;em&gt;The State of Working America&lt;/em&gt; remains the most comprehensive resource about the economic experience of working Americans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
