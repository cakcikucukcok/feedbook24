  <title>No Time for Tomorrow: A Practical Guide to Strategic Business Development Through Projects - Francis X. Livingston, Amber M. Alke, George J. Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the midst of all that&#39;s required to keep things running smoothly, it is easy for the managers and owners in a small or midsize business to lose sight of long-term objectives, and quite difficult to find the time for planning, staffing and execution of projects that can address emerging threats and opportunities. As business owners and managers ourselves, the authors of this book have been there. We learned to recognize the direct link between past successes and the forward planning efforts that made them possible, and wished for a straightforward, practical, repeatable approach to the process.   Thus began a three year journey to identify, organize, streamline and document the essential ingredients of &quot;strategic business development&quot; from a small or midsize business owner&#39;s perspective. The process was enlightening, and the result ... well it&#39;s in your hands ... enjoy!" />
