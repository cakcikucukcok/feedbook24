  <title>How to Change the World with a 501(C)(3) - Olivia C. Santoro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to Change the World with a 501(c)(3) provides a simple yet comprehensive framework for starting and running a successful 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. This book is inspired by the authors experience founding two nonprofits and working with existing nonprofit organizations over the past decade. 501(c)(3) status, which is granted by the IRS to qualified applicants, exempts eligible nonprofits from federal income tax requirements. In certain states, 501(c)(3) status also exempts nonprofits from state corporate income tax obligations. Tax-exempt status allows more of the money donated to worthy and charitable causes to end up supporting those causes directly, and therefore is highly coveted by nonprofits. Additionally, financial contributions made to a 501(c)(3) are deductible by donors for federal income tax purposes, making donating more attractive and lending increased credibility to the organization. The primary audience for this book is individuals who passionately believe in a cause and want to multiply their ability to effect change by utilizing a nonprofit organization. This book will provide you with the tools, confidence, and insight to not only start a 501(c)(3) organization, but also run it like a business in order to maximize its impact on the community." />
