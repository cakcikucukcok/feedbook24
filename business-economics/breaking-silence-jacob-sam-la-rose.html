  <title>Breaking Silence - Jacob Sam-La Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best First Collection and the Aldeburgh First Collection Prize. Jacob Sam-La Rose has been described as &#39;a one-man literary industry&#39;. This was Patrick Neate&#39;s comment on the BBC Poetry Season website: &#39;Passionate about poetry and its power to change people&#39;s lives, he&#39;s a lesson to us all. He&#39;s also a damn fine writer.&#39; Already well-known on the UK performance circuit, Sam-La Rose has also spent many years working with young people in schools and communities, especially around London. So it will come as a surprise to many that Breaking Silence is his first book-length collection of poetry. It is a collection that sits on the threshold between the personal and the profound, with eyes on race and dual heritage; masculinity and manhood; definitions and senses of self. Above all, it&#39;s a collection that&#39;s invested in the power of the voice, in the work of giving a voice to issues and entities that would otherwise remain silent. It speaks on divides, from the spaces in between. Jacob Sam-La Rose&#39;s work is grounded in a belief that poetry can be a powerful force within a community, and that it&#39;s possible to combine the immediacy of poetry in performance with formal rigour and innovation on the page. &#39;Poetry that isfresh, vivid and masterly in its evocation of contemporary Britain&#39; ?Choman Hardi &amp; Martyn Crucefix, PBS Bulletin, on Communion (Poetry Book Society Pamphlet Choice).Shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best First Collection and the Aldeburgh First Collection Prize.
