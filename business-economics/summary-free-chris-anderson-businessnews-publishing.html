  <title>Summary: Free - Chris Anderson - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “FREE: The Future of a Radical Price” by Chris Anderson.Chris Anderson is the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine. He was previously the U.S. business editor for The Economist where he launched their coverage of the emergence of the Internet. He also worked at the journals Nature and Science. At one time, giving away free stuff was an attention grabbing sales gimmick. That has now changed dramatically. In Free, Chris Anderson explains that, in today’s business environment, companies can profit more by giving things away than they can by charging for them. Notably this isn’t just a digital economy phenomenon. It applies right across the global economy. In more and more industries, abundance thinking is becoming a far more powerful engine for commerce than scarcity thinking ever has been. Free is becoming a business strategy which might just end up being essential for any company to survive.As Chris Anderson argues in Free, “sooner or later, every company is going to have to figure out how to use Free or compete with Free, one way or another.”Read this book and you will understand why the most effective price in the digital marketplace is no price at all." />
