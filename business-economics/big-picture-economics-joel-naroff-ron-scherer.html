  <title>Big Picture Economics - Joel Naroff, Ron Scherer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Navigate the economy with this insightful new book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world is awash with economic information.

How can you better understand what it means for you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Picture Economics&lt;/i&gt;, a new book by award-winning columnist and futurist Joel Naroff and veteran journalist Ron Scherer, says the thread that ties everything together is &quot;context.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors show how consumers, business, the Federal Reserve, and government take into account what&#39;s going on around them to make critical decisions like buying new products, building new factories, changing interest rates, or setting budget goals. The book provides a clear roadmap to understanding the whole story behind the global economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Picture Economics&lt;/i&gt; helps readers understand how context impacts decisions and decision makers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; - The Federal Reserve and Congress in formulating economic policy&lt;br /&gt; - Consumers in a shopper nation and what makes us buy or not buy&lt;br /&gt; - Corporations making decisions on whether to build new factories and buy other companies&lt;br /&gt; - The federal budget that must deal with complex issues, including the reduction of health care spending&lt;br /&gt; - A simple test for tax cuts or increases: will they help the economy grow?&lt;br /&gt; - Where to produce and where to sell in a global economy that is more like a Mobius strip than a flat world&lt;br /&gt; - International events that can ripple through the economy and ultimately affect workers in the Midwest&lt;br /&gt; - Technology, such as intelligent drones to wearable computers, are changing the future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts laud the book for its perceptive insights:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;It all sounds like common sense, but it is actually based on a close, expert reading of economic history and what that history implies for the future. Read this book to become a more educated judge of economic policy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—Robert Moffitt&lt;/b&gt;, Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Economics at Johns Hopkins University&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Naroff and Scherer show how seemingly unrelated things like an upgrade of the Panama Canal, a Tex-Mex restaurant&#39;s menu change, or how many Americans are overweight turn out to be intricately linked to our daily experiences. What brings the book to life is the authors&#39; focus on these hidden interconnections.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—Brendan Conway&lt;/b&gt;, blogger and columnist, &lt;i&gt;Barron&#39;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
