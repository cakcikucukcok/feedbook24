  <title>British Gunmakers - Nigel Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This all-new volume sets out the history of the Birmingham, Scottish and regional gunmakers and specialist trade workers throughout the 19th and 20th centuries with individual histories of 60 businesses and where known, details of their serial number records, many of which have never been published before. Similarly there is an alphabetical listing of the businesses and individuals with their dates and addresses and separate listings of the brand names used by them and the patents they registered over the period together with additional information on proof marks. With this book, read in conjunction with Volume One, the reader or scholar would be able to track down the history and likely age of practically any shotgun or rifle made by the gunmakers of England, Scotland and Wales since 1800. Illustrated throughout, this second volume completes this major Work and it will be an invaluable and definitive reference for any collector, shooting enthusiast, historian or gunmaker." />
