  <title>How To Profit In Real Estate Business Ownership: Essential reading for any existing or aspiring real estate business owner - Paul Davies, Tom Panos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you a real estate agent who wants to retain 100% commission and set up your own business? Or are you a real estate business owner looking to increase your profit margin? Whatever your situation, this book will help you build a secure and sustainable financial future for yourself and your family.  In the real estate industry it&#39;s almost impossible, as an independent agency, to compete with the big franchises in your local marketplace. Buying into an established franchise is both constraining and costly, so how can you possibly profit from a real estate business?   Paul Davies has more than 40 years of experience, as a real estate sales agent and multiple business owner. He&#39;s made in excess of 1,000 property sales, has conducted more than 300 auctions and has established over 100 agents in their own businesses. In this book Paul shares his knowledge and experience to guide you in building a profitable and sustainable real estate business.  You will:  Discover how to set up and build a business to secure your financial future |  Understand why business ownership is the only way to future-proof your career |   Identify what it takes to be a successful business person |  Learn how to minimise risks and maximise profit |  Develop an understanding of how to maintain a sustainable business and lifestyle.  Paul is the Founder and CEO of One Agency Group, a truly revolutionary real estate business brand that has literally taken Australia by storm. He&#39;s helped hundreds of real estate agents to overcome the fear of business ownership, and has set up multiple successful and profitable businesses.  Regardless of whether you want to set up a boutique agency, buy into a franchise, or join the One Agency Group, this book is a must-read for any existing or aspiring business owner." />
