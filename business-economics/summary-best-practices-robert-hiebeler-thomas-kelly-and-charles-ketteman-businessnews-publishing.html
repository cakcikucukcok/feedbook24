      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;BEST PRACTICES: Building Your Business With Customer-Focused Solutions&quot; by Robert Hiebeler, Thomas Kelly &amp;amp; Charles Ketteman.&lt;br&gt;Robert Hiebeler is the Managing Director of KnowledgeSpace, an Arthur Andersen project dedicated to the productive leverage of knowledge. Thomas Kelly is the Managing Partner of Arthur Andersen Knowledge Enterprises, a business focused on e-commerce and Internet based businesses. Charles Ketteman is the Managing Partner of Arthur Andersen’s Business Consulting Practice. &lt;br&gt;Arthur Andersen conducted a $30 million research project to identify specifically what world-class companies do better than anyone else. Six business processes were identified and labeled &#39;&#39;best practices’’ because they represent the optimum way for companies to achieve extraordinary results.&lt;br&gt;Taken together, these six business processes combine in a total commitment to and focus on the customer. Best-practice companies vigorously attempt to understand markets, form close associations with customers, design, market and deliver products that customers want. In the process, best-practice companies provide unequaled levels of service to their customers. When everything in the company is focused on learning and responding to what the customer wants, world-class performance can be achieved.&lt;br&gt;Best Practices is the book you need if you wish to learn from the best companies." />
