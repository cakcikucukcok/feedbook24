  <title>Instant-flex 718 - Heather Phillipson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Issuing from the body-mind&#39;s grisly interwedge, Heather Phillipson&#39;s poems are a protest against well-stitched seams, an off-loading of intellectual baggage, a shout from the deep-ish channels of fear. Phillipson&#39;s much anticipated debut collection, Instant-flex 718 is an operatics of reactivation. Splicing the leftovers of culture with spurious monologues discharged from an arrhythmic right ventricle or a mouth filled with half-chewed peanuts, the poems unpick and destabilise. The poet is a plasterer, entering the spits and drips with urgency. An internationally exhibiting artist, Phillipson has an impertinence and dynamism incomparably her own. Her poems observe the ordinary world stagger. &#39;For all the playfulness in Instant-flex 718, it also addresses the weighty issues &quot;??mortality, the relationship between mind and body, the extinction of species, religion &quot;??and its lively combination of intelligence, verve and humour makes it a debut that is both unusually accomplished and unusually pleasurable to read&#39; - Carrie Etter, Guardian. &#39;Instant-flex 718 is an explosive first collection from a poet and artist who thrills and disconcerts in equal measures. Heather Phillipson&#39;s poems fuse subterranean erotic landscapes with the complex pleasures of thought. They conduct a weird, addictive verbal electricity that can both jolt and elate. Handle with care: this book is not for those who like their poetry safely earthed&#39; &quot;??Mark Ford.
