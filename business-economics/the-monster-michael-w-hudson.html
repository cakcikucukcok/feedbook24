  <title>The Monster - Michael W. Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who killed the economy? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A page-turning, true-crime  exposé of the subprime salesmen and Wall Street alchemists who produced  the biggest financial scandal in American history &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;It&#39;s  hard to have a guilty conscience if you don&#39;t have a conscience.  Anything that benefited production - that benefited me and benefited my  wallet - I&#39;d do it.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales force at Ameriquest Mortgage  took this philosophy to heart. They watched the Hollywood  white-collar-crime flick &quot;Boiler Room&quot; as a training tape, studying how  to pitch overpriced deals to unsuspecting home owners. They learned how  to forge signatures on mortgage paperwork and create fake documents in  &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; operations they dubbed &quot;The Lab&quot; or &quot;The Art  Department.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this stunning narrative, award-winning reporter  Michael W. Hudson reveals the story of the rise and fall of the subprime  mortgage business by chronicling the rise and fall of two corporate  empires: Ameriquest and Lehman Brothers. As the biggest subprime lender  and Wall Street&#39;s biggest patron of subprime, Ameriquest and Lehman did  more than any other institutions to create the feeding frenzy that  emboldened mortgage pros to flood the nation with high-risk, high-profit  home loans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a tale populated by a remarkable cast of the  characters: a shadowy billionaire who created the subprime industry out  of the ashes of the 1980s S&amp;L scandal; Wall Street executives with  an insatiable desire for product; struggling home owners ensnared in the  most ingenious of traps; lawyers and investigators who tried to expose  the fraud; politicians and bureaucrats who turned a blind eye; and, most  of all, the drug-snorting, high-living salesmen who tell all about the  money they made, the lies they told, the deals they closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provocative and gripping, &lt;i&gt;The Monster&lt;/i&gt; is a searing exposé of the bottom-feeding fraud and top-down greed that fueled the financial collapse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
