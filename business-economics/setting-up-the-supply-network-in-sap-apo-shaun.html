  <title>Setting Up the Supply Network in SAP APO - Shaun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Never before has a supply planning book concentrated solely on setting up the Supply Network Planning (SNP) model in SAP APO, the most fully-featured supply chain planning suite on the market. This book is the only book on supply planning to focus entirely on how to set up supply networks in APO, and how to meet highly-customized requirements that relate to supply network design. You won&#39;t even find these topics covered in depth in SAP Training classes! Companies should evaluate multiple supply network designs thoroughly before choosing a solution. The solution must strike a balance between meeting business requirements and being workable and maintainable. This book will teach you what you need to know to find this balance and evaluate solutions with confidence. Through extensive use of graphics and screen images, this book will familiarize you with Supply Network Planning in SAP APO and show you what you need to do to design supply networks for real-life applications, where everyday business requirements necessitate a nonstandard network design.g the behavior of planning applications. But few people understand the impact that timing settings in one APO application have on other APO applications, and what implications they have for controlling system output. APO is the most fully-featured supply chain planning suite on the market, and its sheer number of timing settings makes it one of the most complex as well! Keeping these settings straight and associating the timings across the modules-as well as coordinating the timings with the connected systems-is a challenge in APO. If you would like to better understand the timing settings in APO and other advanced planning systems, or if your company is planning to implement APO, this book is for you. Here you will learn about the timing settings, planning horizons and calendars in four of the most commonly-implemented APO applications (DP, SNP, PP/DS and GATP), and how timing settings in one APO module interact with and impact upon the timing settings in the other APO modules." />
