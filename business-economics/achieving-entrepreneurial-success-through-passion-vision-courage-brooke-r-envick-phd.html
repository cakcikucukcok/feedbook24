  <title>Achieving Entrepreneurial Success Through Passion, Vision &amp; Courage - Brooke R. Envick PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The quintessential American Dream is to own a business and make a living doing what you love. For many, this seems quite difficult because there tends to be information overload when you search for ways to do it. On top of that, many people believe that entrepreneurship is only reserved for a select group of people with a certain personality type. While being an entrepreneur is certainly not for everyone, it is a viable option for many. You probably have more passion, vision and courage than you realize to make your entrepreneurial dreams come true!
Based on a 20-year study of approximately 200 successful entrepreneurs, this book is designed to unleash your passion, vision, and courage, provide it with direction, and elevate it to a whole new level, called dynamic success. The Entrepreneurial Intelligence Model is the basis for the book, and it includes three themes and eight qualities for entrepreneurial success:
Passion:
Ambition
Work Ethic
Continuous Learning
Vision:
Innovation
Using People as an
Asset
Courage:
Taking Informed-Risk
Integrity
Resilience
The Entrepreneurial Intelligence Model also includes five action-steps, which are:
Generating Ideas
Creating Value Propositions and a Competitive Advantage
Conducting an Idea Merit Survey
Completing at Feasibility Analysis
Developing a Business Plan
This is all provided in an easy to read, understandable, step-by-step format. If you want to make your American Dream a reality, this book is for you!" />
