With designs for tree decorations, hand-made gifts, Christmas cards, gift wrap ideas and more, this book is a must have to help you make the most out of the holidays. Every project comes complete with clear step-by-step instructions and beautiful illustrations, meaning anyone can have a go at making something elegant. So why not get the family involved and create special holiday memories by making decorations together? You can then relive those happy moments each year as you decorate your home.Since childhood, Clare Youngs has loved making beautiful handcrafted objects. She studied graphic design and went on to work in packaging for a number of high street stores, including Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and House of Fraser. Clare has since worked in illustration and book jacket design before deciding to turn her attentions to craft full time. Clare&#39;s other books include Papercrafting in No Time, Scandinavian Needlecraft, Find It, Make It, and The Perfect Handmade Bag, all available from CICO Books." />
