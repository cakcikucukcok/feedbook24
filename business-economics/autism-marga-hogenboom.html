  <title>Autism - Marga Hogenboom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Educating and caring for an autistic child is a severely difficult task, too often associated with frustration and disappointment. As a result, the inner development of children with autism is at times considered to be beyond the reach of parents and carers. This book challenges that assumption, exploring case studies where therapy based on a holistic approach has resulted in marked improvements in the autistic child&#39;s behaviour and social integration. With an extended holistic programme, autistic children discover inner self-awareness and self-recognition, leading to first steps in relationships and social skills. The authors describe in detail their own practical experiences, as well as the findings of other experts in the field. This new third edition covers recent developments in diagnostic methods and approaches to treatment, including new case studies and a new chapter looking at the sensory aspect of autism and Sensory Integration Therapy. Well-researched and movingly written, this book has an essential, positive message for all those involved in the care and education of autistic children.Educating and caring for an autistic child is a severely difficult task, too often associated with frustration and disappointment.
