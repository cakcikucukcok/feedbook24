  <title>Differentiation Pocketbook - Peter Anstee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A glance at the history books or the pages of a Dickens novel reminds us how far education has come since the days when pupils sat silently in rows memorising knowledge imparted by the teacher. Learning was passive, and only gender and social class affected provision. In today&#39;s schools learning is at the centre of what we do and differentiation - the process of modifying a lesson or part of a lesson for one or some of the learners - is a fundamental part of teaching. Turning theory into practice and including 20 key types of differentiation, this Pocketbook is about planning and teaching creative, student-focused lessons where every learner is appropriately challenged and where engaged, stimulated and motivated students work in a state of &#39;flow&#39;. In this kind of environment true differentiation serves not to label but to enable. &quot;Peter Anstee&#39;s book is simple but not simplistic. It is not an idiot&#39;s guide&#39; but rather it reminds the initiate and the seasoned pedagogue of the fundamental importance of differentiation to effective teaching and learning. Its informed and (mercifully) succinct overview of the theory and manifold practical strategies provide an ideal companion for the busy professional.&quot;Pete Fishleigh, Faculty Leader - English, Brentwood County High School &quot;This gem of a book doesn&#39;t disguise the challenge differentiation presents, but it is packed full of practical techniques which are easily incorporated into any lesson. It inspires, informs and gives the reader the confidence to improve their practice. A must-have for teaching today.&quot;Alice Edge, 2nd in MFL, Responsible for Community Languages - Valentines High School &quot;This Pocketbook provides all the tips necessary to an outstanding teacher since all the key strategies which help students to learn more effectively are included. The theories are easy to understand because they are clearly linked to classroom practice, and experimentation seems possible.&quot;Debbie Kirk, English Consultant, School Improvement and Early Years - Essex LA" />
