  <title>Private Mortgage Investment - Ralph Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Private Mortgage Investment
Senior lending officer Ralph Abbott pens new book on achieving financial freedom.
Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D., wrote in his book Stop Acting RichAnd Start Living Like A Real Millionaire, Real safety is not in a diversified stock portfolio. One of the reasons that real millionaires are economically successful is that they think differently. Many a millionaire has told me that true diversity has much to do with controlling ones investments; no one can control the stock market. But you can for example, control your own business, private investments, and money to lend to private parties. It was this quote that inspired author and senior lending officer Ralph Abbott to help others worried about their 401k and retirement nest eggs, penning his new book Private Mortgage Investment. 
My reason for writing a book about private mortgage investing is not to promote another get-rich-quick scheme or investment fad, explains Abbott. Its about showing you an alternative investment concept  one that is old and respected. 
In this straightforward and practical book, Ralph Abbott gets you quickly acquainted with simple strategies using mortgage investments to enhance your bottom line. 
Private Mortgage Investment cuts to the heart of successful mortgage investment, providing readers with a complete understanding of private mortgage investing fundamentals. It shows how to use direct investments, mortgage pool and investment clubs to get into the private mortgage investment business. 
As we move into the second decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of people just like you are discovering private mortgage investing. Its a basic, fundamental function of real estate finance that, with a focused effort and basic knowledge, has been demonstrated to be a safe and profitable industry for a growing number of investors who are either approaching or in retirement.
And do you know what? If you have ever owned a bank CD, or have a savings account or checking account, you have already been investing  but you have not received the benefits." />
