      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Australia is the Lucky Country, and Joey Driscol knows it.

For a time, they do just that, and soon welcome their son Marti into the family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as the years pass, this new life thousands of miles from the Old Country comes under threat. Joey&#39;s wife has been struggling with demons of her own, their marriage is on the rocks and suddenly, Shauna disappears and takes Marti with her. Joey is beside himself, with no clues about where they are, with both his childhood sweetheart and his son - his pride and joy - now missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, when Joey gets word that his wife and son have returned to Ireland, he knows that he&#39;ll now have to do the same if he ever wants to see them again.
