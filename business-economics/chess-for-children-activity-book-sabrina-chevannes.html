  <title>Chess for Children Activity Book - Sabrina Chevannes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A follow up to Chess for Children, this is a very imaginative way of building up your children&#39;s knowledge and interest in chess through a series of fun chess games and activities. The same two cheeky children, Jess and Jamie, talk though the games in language that kids would relate to &quot;?? and this time they are joined by their friends Harry and Marnie so that group chess games can be explored. The book includes puzzles and games, some easy &#39;variants&#39; of chess, and a guess-the-next move section, along with &#39;revision&#39; pages to help remind children of the chess basics. All are accompanied by easy-to-read chess boards and fun illustrations. Chess in schools and clubs is growing all the time and our author is a leading light in kids chess, teaching at many London schools, including Dulwich College. The book works well as a companion to the earlier book, Chess for Children, but also as a standalone activity book. Whether your child is just beginning to learn chess or already immersed in the subject, this book will help encourage their interest and love of the subject. A great book for both parents and teachers. Suitable for children aged 7 and up." />
