Now you can have them&amp;#151;in a set of HBR&amp;#8217;s 10 Must Reads, available as a 7-volume paperback boxed set or as an ebook set. We&amp;#8217;ve combed through hundreds of &lt;I&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/I&gt; articles on change, leadership, strategy, managing people, and managing yourself and selected the most important ones to help you maximize your own and your organization&#39;s performance. The HBR&amp;#8217;s 10 Must Reads Boxed Set includes seven bestselling collections: &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HBR&#39;s 10 Must Reads on Leadership&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; (ways you can transform yourself from a good manager into an extraordinary leader); &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HBR&#39;s 10 Must Reads on Managing Yourself&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; (the path to your own professional success starts with a critical look in the mirror and what you see there&amp;#151;your greatest strengths and deepest values&amp;#151;are the foundations you must build on); &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HBR&#39;s 10 Must Reads on Strategy&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; (will help galvanize your organization&#39;s strategy development and execution); &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HBR&#39;s 10 Must Reads on Change&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; (70% of all change initiatives fail, but the odds turn in your company&#39;s favor once you understand that change is a multi-stage process&amp;#151;not an event&amp;#151;and that persuasion is key to establishing a sense of urgency, winning support, and silencing naysayers); &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HBR&#39;s 10 Must Reads on Managing People&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; (will help you determine what really motivates people, how to deal with problem employees, and how to build an effective team); &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HBR&#39;s 10 Must Reads: The Essentials&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; (which brings together the best thinking from management&amp;#8217;s most influential experts); and &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HBR&amp;#8217;s 10 Must Reads on Emotional Intelligence&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; (the trait that is twice as important as other competencies in determining outstanding leadership).
