  <title>Work is Love Made Visible - Frances Hesselbein, Marshall Goldsmith, Sarah McArthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Channel happiness and find your purpose with stories from the world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;s leading minds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Work is Love Made Visible&lt;/i&gt; offers the insights of some of the world’s greatest thought leaders as they tackle one of life’s most difficult treasure hunts: finding purpose. The word “purpose” is big. Very big. And heavy. It carries the weight of a lifetime of work and struggle; the weight of legacy, and the mass of days spent &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; doing something else. It’s something we all grapple with at some point—some of us find our purpose, others spend a lifetime searching. A lucky few grow to realize they’ve been working their purpose all along. Most of us aren’t quite that lucky; often, fulfilling your purpose requires some kind of change—career, lifestyle, habits, family—and what then? Are we selfish for the upheaval, or are we fulfilling destiny? Once we know our purpose, how do we pursue it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book asked those very questions of people who have followed their purpose and succeeded on a global scale. Their un-distilled answers are here, lending you the wisdom of their experiences, their examples, inspiration, and motivations as they:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tackle the universal struggle with individual purpose and meaning&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Illustrate how personal thought patterns contribute to real-world action&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Move challenges into the opportunities of their lives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reveal how they arrived at their life’s purpose, and what they sacrificed to get there&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all want a meaningful life. We want to work together for a brighter future, we want to celebrate our differences and commit to good. We want to inspire others, nurture their talents, and help them grow. We want to look back one day on a life well-lived, and leave something behind that matters to the world. &lt;i&gt;Work is Love Made Visible&lt;/i&gt; shows you how some of us have succeeded, and offers you insight and guidance so that you can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;" />
