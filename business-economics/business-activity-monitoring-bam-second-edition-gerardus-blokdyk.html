      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What tools do you use once you have decided on a Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) strategy and more importantly how do you choose?  Does our organization need more Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) education?  Where do ideas that reach policy makers and planners as proposals for Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) strengthening and reform actually originate?  How did the Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) manager receive input to the development of a Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) improvement plan and the estimated completion dates/times of each activity?  What potential environmental factors impact the Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) effort?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions.
