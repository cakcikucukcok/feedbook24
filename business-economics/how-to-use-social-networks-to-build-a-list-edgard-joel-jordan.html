  <title>How to Use Social Networks to Build a List - Edgard Joel Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Learn How To Use Social Networks To Build A List!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Social networks have made building and widening your social contacts extremely easy. In the past, you might have had to attend numerous functions and paying for gas, food, and clothing just to show up and hand out a few business cards that later got tossed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
With online social networking, the costs of networking are zero, but the rewards are immeasurable. Creating a list of social contacts online can lead to opportunities worldwide, something that local networking could never do for you.&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of trying to push people into getting acquainted with you or your company, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if you could get up each morning and find seven to ten new people wanting to befriend or follow you? This is completely doable with social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you establish a profile and a following, just your everyday activities online can draw people to you without you having to go out and find them. Even if you do choose to find people first, it&amp;#39;s still far easier to connect with them online and far less intrusive than trying to schedule a meeting, a phone date, or any other old-fashioned method of networking." />
