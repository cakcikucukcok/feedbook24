To negotiate successfully you need a game plan - your ultimate aim and a strategy for achieving it. The key to effective negotiating is having a negotiation strategy, understanding the difference between &#39;positions&#39; and &#39;interests&#39;, knowing how to make concessions, managing negotiation deadlocks, and having respect for the negotiation relationship.

Participants will add to their toolkit of basic negotiation techniques by further exploring the BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) concept for improved negotiation outcomes plus other advanced negotiating skills. Participants will learn how to prepare for their next negotiation to protect themselves from accepting terms which are unfavorable, avoid rejecting terms that they would be wise to accept, and be flexible enough to permit exploration of creative alternatives. This Learning Short-take is designed for completion in approximately 90 minutes.Learning Objectives• Describe critical variables in a negotiation and how these can be used to benefit you at the negotiating table.• Identify those factors that influence the decision making process during a negotiation.• Describe the various negotiation styles and how you can adapt your own style to deal with them more effectively.• Explain strategies for maintaining positive working relationships after the negotiations have concluded.• Create a Skills Development Action Plan." />
