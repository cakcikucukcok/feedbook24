  <title>The Harvard Business Review Leader&#39;s Handbook - Ron Ashkenas, Brook Manville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Put aside all the hypey new frameworks, the listicles, the &quot;10 best things you need&quot; to succeed as a leader today. The critical leadership practices--the ones that will allow a leader to make the biggest impact over time--are already well established. They&#39;re about how you relate to others. How you make difficult strategic choices. How you get results. How you scan the landscape around you, build a vision for the future, and inspire people to follow you. In fact, these fundamental skills are becoming &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; important today as organizations and teams become increasingly networked and fragmented and the nature of leadership hierarchies changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s hard is actually doing these things--and excelling at them. In this book, strategy and change experts Ron Ashkenas and Brook Manville distill the best proven ideas and frameworks about leadership from &lt;i&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/i&gt; and from their careers in leadership development and transformation into a concise handbook that shows rising leaders how to have the most impact on their organizations. You&#39;ll learn how to build a unifying vision, set strategy, manage for results, hire and inspire great leaders and teams, drive innovation, and, finally, lead yourself on your own career journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each chapter of the book describes one of these six practices in depth, discussing the pitfalls that real leaders face and how to overcome them, with insights from well-known leaders such as Stanley McChrystal, Dominic Barton, Darren Walker, Jack Welch, and Ann Mulcahy. Each chapter also synthesizes the best &lt;i&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/i&gt; thinking on the topic. This book gives you the tools you need to have more impact as a leader today, and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
