As he makes clear in this visionary guide&amp;#8212;now updated with addition material, including new case studies, and a new introduction&amp;#8212;design thinking is not just applicable to so-called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It&amp;#8217;s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente, to increase the quality of patient care by re-examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change, or Kraft, to rethink supply chain management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change by Design&lt;/em&gt; is not a book by designers for designers; it is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization, product, or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
