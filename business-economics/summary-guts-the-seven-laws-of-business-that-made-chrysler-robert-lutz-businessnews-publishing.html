  <title>Summary: GUTS - The Seven Laws of Business That Made Chrysler - Robert Lutz - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “GUTS: The Seven Laws of Business That Made Chrysler the World’s Hottest Car Company” by Robert Lutz. Robert Lutz is the former President and Vice-Chairman of Chrysler Corporation. Born in Switzerland, he has a 30-year business career which followed a decade of service as a pilot with the United States Marine Corps. Robert Lutz came to Chrysler Corporation in 1986 after serving as Chairman of Ford of Europe, Executive Vice-President of International Operations for Ford and earlier assignments with General Motors and BMW. According to Lutz, in business, as in most of life’s endeavors, you can’t really separate the rational from the emotional, or the left-brain logical approach from the right-brain creative approach. At the end of the day, everything gets intertwined. Business is all about serving the needs of people. And people don’t act rationally all the time – they are a mass of contradictions, paradoxes and emotions. Therefore, the key to prosperity lies in accepting your fate and making the most of it. In Guts, Lutz presents his seven laws of business, explaining how they can be applied in creating a successful company. If you are interested in automotive business, Guts is the perfect book for you." />
