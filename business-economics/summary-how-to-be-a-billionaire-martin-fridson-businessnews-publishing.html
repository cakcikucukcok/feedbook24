  <title>Summary: How To Be A Billionaire - Martin Fridson - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “HOW TO BE A BILLIONAIRE: Proven Strategies From The Titans Of Wealth” by Martin Fridson.&lt;br&gt;Billionaires make their money in different markets, but the methods and strategies are remarkably similar. Martin Fridson’s research has isolated these methods, and explains them in a clear way for the reader. He suggests that billionaire start with the same elements as other successful businesses, but to that they add unique touches. They focus efforts in high-growth industries, take bigger risks and apply unorthodox business strategies. Above all, they chose one or two goals, and everything else in their lives is subordinate to that.&lt;br&gt;Fridson uses examples to describe each strategy clearly. For example, one of the strategies, is extraordinary, monumental risk: not every billionaire takes risks all the time, but at a crucial points, they have done. WalMart’s founder, Sam Walton made every effort to avoid debt in general, but when bar-coding and satellite communications became available, he invested, before they were thought to be merchandising ideas. This risk paid vast dividends that pushed WalMart past its competitors. &lt;br&gt;He uses examples such as this for every strategy, demonstrating that billionaires do not have a “secret formula”: they used approaches that anyone can learn, and apply. How to be a Billionaire is a thought-provoking read. &lt;br&gt;" />
