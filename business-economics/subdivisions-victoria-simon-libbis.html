  <title>Subdivisions Victoria - Simon Libbis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Subdivisions Victoria has all the information you need to help you through the subdivision process and all that is related to it. It explains the nature of subdivisions and the initial steps involved. There is more detail of the town planning requirements and the process for having a plan registered.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Owners corporations and common property and the issues to which they give rise feature prominently.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Buying and selling &#39;off the plan&#39; have become commonplace, but carry significant risks. This book will help you step through that particular minefield. There are even some helpful precedent conditions and letters.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;Not in common ownership&#39; plans and the further subdivision of land affected by an owners corporation carry their own special challenges. You will be much better equipped to deal with them if you have Subdivisions Victoria.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It can serve as both an instruction manual for those new to the area and a valuable reference for those already practising in it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This comprehensive guide to subdivisions is written in a way that is easy to understand. How it is set out makes it simple to follow." />
