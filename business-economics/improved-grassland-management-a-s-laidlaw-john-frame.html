  <title>Improved Grassland Management - A S Laidlaw, John Frame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This new, fully updated and revised edition of Improved Grassland Management covers all aspects of grassland management and is of particular relevance to the UK and the Republic of Ireland, although the principles discussed apply to all temperate grassland zones. Almost twenty years ago, when the original edition of this book was written by John Frame, issues such as efficiency in the use of nutrients in manures, grassland biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions from ruminant production were either nascent, or of no relevance to mainstream grassland farming. The intervening two decades have seen the introduction of water and, latterly, air quality directives by the EU, cross compliance, the single farm payment, and an ever-increasing need for grassland farmers to be conscious of the economics of their business. The present edition, which has been thoroughly revised by Scott Laidlaw, covers the full scope of modern grassland management. Accordingly the application of technical developments in supplying and utilizing grass and forage, which remain central to grassland management, is presented in the context of these changes.Topics covered include: breeding and evaluation of new varieties of grass to meet current needs; new technology in establishing swards; legislative constraints, background science and practice in determining forage quality and the utilization of forage either for grazing or silage; feed budgeting, grassland biodiversity, grassland and climate change, and transferring knowledge and technology; wide-ranging list of sources and references, which provides the reader with further detailed information. Essential reading for all those involved in modern grassland management including grassland farmers, agricultural consultants and advisory officers, as well as agricultural, land use and biology students. Written in a reader-friendly advisory style, it can be read and understood without an in-depth technical or scientific background. Fully illustrated with 61 colour photographs.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
