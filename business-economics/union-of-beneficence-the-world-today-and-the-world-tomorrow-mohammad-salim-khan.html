  <title>Union of Beneficence the World Today and the World Tomorrow - Mohammad Salim Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The aim is to create new vistas of discovery and have a new look at the histories of nations to develop an education system that will be an integrated system of education. This system of education will have the capacity to teach languages at a mass level and give the children capability, character, and knowledge to be able to stand on their own feet at an early age. Similarly, in the field of business and agriculture, we feel there is a need for the better utilization of land and water resources, development of barren lands, and development of new varieties of food so as to ensure a balance where the undernourished get the food and the surplus food does not get to be thrown away by the developed nations. Development of a new political system where the corrupt and terrorist segments of the society, who are creating chaos and anarchy, are eliminated. Money should not be let into the hands of terrorists and crooks. A system where people are given position on merit rather than their relationship with the corrupt people." />
