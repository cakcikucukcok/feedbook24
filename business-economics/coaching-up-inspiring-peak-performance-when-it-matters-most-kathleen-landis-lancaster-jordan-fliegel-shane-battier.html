  <title>Coaching Up! Inspiring Peak Performance When It Matters Most - Kathleen Landis Lancaster, Jordan Fliegel, Shane Battier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Connect, engage, motivate, and inspire using top coaching techniques&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coaching Up!&lt;/i&gt; is about inspiring those who matter to you to achieve peak performance. Whether you are a coach, a business leader, a civic activist, a teacher, a counselor, or a parent, this book will offer you a powerful, highly effective way to connect to the people you care about and move them forward toward their best selves. In sports, coaches have developed ways of connecting with their players &lt;i&gt;quickly&lt;/i&gt; in the &quot;heat of the battle,&quot; inspiring them to perform to their fullest potential and &quot;leave it all on the field.&quot; Interestingly, although these techniques have not been codified, great coaches have independently developed remarkably similar models. This book aligns these techniques and distills their essence into a fundamental skill set that anyone can use to connect with, support, and inspire his or her colleagues, teammates, friends, and family members. At its foundation, great coaching is based on a solid set of techniques that can be applied to all areas of life. Essentially, those skills boil down to forging authentic connections, providing genuine support, and offering concise direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While our everyday pressures may be less intense than those of a championship, the long-term game is even more important. Why not borrow from the best to develop the skills and abilities to win every day?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Inspire and motivate people to higher performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Improve communication in high-stakes situations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be more effective both professionally and socially&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting inside the way great coaching works gives you an unparalleled glimpse at the core of inspiration. A great coach can make the difference between a mediocre player and a world champion. What would that difference look like if you could inspire every colleague in your business? Everyone who matters to you in your personal life? You can be the source of empowerment and motivation that helps the people around you reach higher, go further, and achieve more. &lt;i&gt;Coaching Up!&lt;/i&gt; gives you the game plan—and shows you how to run the plays.&lt;/p&gt;" />
