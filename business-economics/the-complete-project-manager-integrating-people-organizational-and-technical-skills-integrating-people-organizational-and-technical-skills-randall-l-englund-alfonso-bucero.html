  <title>The Complete Project Manager: Integrating People, Organizational, and Technical Skills: Integrating People, Organizational, and Technical Skills - Randall L Englund, Alfonso Bucero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get proven procedures to overcome project challenges  The Complete Project Manager: Integrating People, Organizational, and Technical Skills is the practical guide that addresses the &quot;soft&quot; project management skills that are so essential to successful project, program, and portfolio management. Through a storytelling approach, the authors explain the necessary skills-and how to use them-to create an environment that supports project success. They demonstrate both the &quot;why&quot; and the &quot;how&quot; of creatively applying soft project management skills in the areas of leadership, conflict resolution, negotiations, change management, and more.  The Complete Project Manager&#39;s Toolkit integrates theory and application, humor and passion, and concepts and examples drawn from the authors&#39; experiences as well as from contributors who share their stories. The concepts are easy to understand, universal, powerful, and readily applicable. There is no complicated model to understand before practicing what you learn...or wish you had learned when starting your career. Achieve greater results through changed thinking in a way that is simple and immediately actionable!
