  <title>The Dichotomy of Leadership - Jocko Willink, Leif Babin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE INSTANT #1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling authors of &lt;i&gt;Extreme Ownership&lt;/i&gt; comes a new and revolutionary approach to help leaders recognize and attain the leadership balance crucial to victory. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With their first book, &lt;i&gt;Extreme Ownership&lt;/i&gt; (published in October 2015), Jocko Willink and Leif Babin set a new standard for leadership, challenging readers to become better leaders, better followers, and better people, in both their professional and personal lives. Now, in THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;Jocko and Leif dive even deeper into the unchartered and complex waters of a concept first introduced in &lt;i&gt;Extreme Ownership&lt;/i&gt;: finding balance between the opposing forces that pull every leader in different directions. Here, Willink and Babin get granular into the nuances that every successful leader must navigate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mastering the Dichotomy of Leadership requires understanding when to lead and when to follow; when to aggressively maneuver and when to pause and let things develop; when to detach and let the team run and when to dive into the details and micromanage. In addition, every leader must:&lt;br&gt;·         Take Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission, yet utilize Decentralize Command by giving ownership to their team. &lt;br&gt;·         Care deeply about their people and their individual success and livelihoods, yet look out for the good of the overall team and above all accomplish the strategic mission. &lt;br&gt;·         Exhibit the most important quality in a leader--humility, but also be willing to speak up and push back against questionable decisions that could hurt the team and the mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With examples from the authors&#39; combat and training experiences in the SEAL teams, and then a demonstration of how each lesson applies to the business world, Willink and Babin clearly explain THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;skills that are mission-critical for any leader and any team to achieve their ultimate goal: VICTORY.&lt;/p&gt;" />
