  <title>35 Video Podcasting Careers &amp; Businesses to Start - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Launch your career or business in video podcasting. Are you looking for a job in video podcasting? Anyone with a digital video camcorder, microphone, computer and some technical savvy can launch an Internet video podcast show to inform, direct or enlighten. You can offer foresight, insight, or hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a business or find a job creating and delivering digital video recordings-usually free-as podcasts. If you want to make money with video podcasting, offer to sell a sponsor&#39;s publicity and advertising on your video, or an author&#39;s creative works, interviews, or sermons. You can even show people how to fill out tax forms using a video podcast for instruction on most any subject people can learn independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who subscribe to video podcasts usually want to view for free. You can charge for a course to train or teach a class by video lecture and/or demonstration, but what if you want an actual paid job in video podcasting? And can you make more money in video than in the older, audio MP3 file &#39;radio&#39; podcasting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careers in video podcasting are beginning to bloom as seen by a variety of podcasting associations, news publications, and career information. Even job listings unrelated to podcasting are &#39;broadcast&#39; by RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create your own job in podcasting by showing others how to find new trends and applications in their careers. Make informational, how-to, and motivational video podcasts. What if you want to use video podcasting to actually get hired? Are there jobs right now in video podcasting? Or is the field still primarily for trade publication publishers, syndicators, and video entrepreneurs on the Web?&lt;/p&gt;" />
