  <title>Clueless Dogs - Rhian Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clueless Dogs is the first collection of poetry by Rhian Edwards. Already a noted performer of both her songs and poetry, this book confirms her startling talent and is shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best First Collection. Poems like &#39;The Welshman Who Couldn&#39;t Sing&#39; chronicle a fraught childhood in Bridgend, south Wales, where the sensitive child escapes through imaginative games of &#39;Playing Dead&#39; and &#39;Broken Lifeboat&#39;. Full of verve and humour, with a spiky syntax featuring hard-edged consonants, her language has a winning honesty and intensity. Later poems chronicle teenage lusts, student rivalries, damaged peers and tense situations. Although the author doesn&#39;t flinch from ruthless depictions in which we are often implicated by her use of the third person &#39;You&#39;, there is an underlying sweetness, an elegiac thread most evident in the poems of maturity, like &#39;Back to Bed&#39; ,&#39;Safe&#39; ,&#39;The Wrong Season&#39; full of both the sensual rapture of love and a clear-eyed realization of its inevitable disappointments. Witness the poet in performance and it is impossible not to hear her distinctive tones when reading her work. Clueless Dogs is a brave and beautiful first book." />
