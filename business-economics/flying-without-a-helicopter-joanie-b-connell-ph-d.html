                        In Flying Without a Helicopter, Joanie Connell details unique challenges faced by young adults and their leaders in the workplace,
                        offering action plans readers can apply to their real work situation as they move toward solution. This book was written for
                        youwhether you are a manager, a young adult new to the business world, or a parent of that young adult. Thanks, Joanie, for zooming in
                        on this timely topic!

                        The problems Joanie Connell describes are real. Employees are enteringand leavingthe workplace without the levels of resilience and
                        independence they need to succeed. I recommend Flying without a Helicopter to people who want to develop the life skills needed to
                        succeed in the corporate world (and their parents) and to leaders who want their companies to succeed.

                        Managing across generations now is remarkably difficult, as each one approaches timelines, deadlines, conflict, and recognition in
                        different ways. To understand these differences and leverage the creativity within, you could do no better than to read Connells
