  <title>The Global Brand - Nigel Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A top executive at one of the world&#39;s leading marketing firms analyzes the familiarity and strength of brands and establishes five steps towards increasing brand strength in a globalized world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rapid advances in modern technology present companies with quickly expanding marketing opportunities, but they also create an over-saturated business landscape that both helps and hurts brands. &lt;i&gt;The Global Brand &lt;/i&gt;is a thorough investigation of brand strength in the accelerated modern business world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nigel Hollis draws on his experience at Millward Brown to present a simple formula for determining brand strength based on two axes, Presence (or familiarity) and Voltage (or marketing appeal), to illustrate the market value and performance of brands. He analyzes the five steps of customer commitment to a strong brand--Presence, Relevance, Performance, Advantage, and Bonding. Finally, Hollis emphasizes human nature as a set of constant core values that all brands should appeal to, and analyzes the future of brand-building as a profitable investment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In &lt;i&gt;The Global Brand&lt;/i&gt;, Nigel Hollis not only corrects some of the misconceptions of the past but offers a glimpse of the future that is both perceptive and grounded in good business sense. Those who take the time to properly digest this book will save their companies a lot of money.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Sir Martin Sorrell, Chief Executive Officer, WPP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
