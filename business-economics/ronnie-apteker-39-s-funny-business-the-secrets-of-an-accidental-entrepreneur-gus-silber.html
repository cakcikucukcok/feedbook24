  <title>Ronnie Apteker&#39;s Funny Business: The Secrets of an Accidental Entrepreneur - Gus Silber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why does an entrepreneur, like a comedian, need to close a deal every 15 seconds? It is said that inside every successful entrepreneur there is a stand-up comic struggling to get out. Well, meet one who managed to escape. His name is Ronnie Apteker, and no, he&#39;s not an apteker. He&#39;s the high-energy, high-tech founder of South Africa&#39;s first internet service provider, Internet Solutions, and a number of other innovative online ventures. But his real business is getting a laugh out of people, whether it&#39;s in a boardroom, on a stage or on a movie set. As a storyteller, moviemaker and creative spirit, Ronnie takes business seriously enough to know that you don&#39;t need to take yourself too seriously to succeed. Funny Business is a seriously funny and comically serious look at the arcane art and science of entrepreneurship, in which Ronnie reveals why it helps, as an entrepreneur, to have a nice Jewish mother; why being a waiter is the best training for an entrepreneur, especially if you&#39;re serving steak tartare; why you sometimes need to slow down to move fast in a world where progress is a paradox; and why some mistakes are too good to make only once  Much more than a business book, this book is everyone&#39;s business. It&#39;s about the way the world works; it&#39;s about living your life with grace and purpose; it&#39;s about learning to love what you do for a living. And it might help you to make it as an entrepreneur ... not to mention a stand-up comic." />
