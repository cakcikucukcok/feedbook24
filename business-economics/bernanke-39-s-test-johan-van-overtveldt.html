  <title>Bernanke&#39;s Test - Johan Van Overtveldt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The consensus on Alan Greenspan&#39;s performance as Fed chair used to be extremely positive, but more and more it&#39;s been called into question. Now, 2008 has seen Ben Bernanke in the eye of a storm that was created largely during Greenspan&#39;s tenure. His management of the bubble of all bubbles will be a decisive factor in whether this crisis will be limited in its impact on the real economy or whether it directly leads to a major recession. This is Bernanke&#39;s Test.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In examining the challenges facing Bernanke, author Johan Van Overtveldt reviews Greenspan&#39;s long record as Fed chair, as well as Ben Bernanke&#39;s career as an economist prior to replacing Greenspan. The book offers much-needed historical context by exploring the role and reach of the central banker, and how former Fed chairmen &amp;#151; Benjamin Strong, William McChesney Martin, Arthur Burns, and especially Paul Volcker &amp;#151; dealt with the same complex issues Bernanke faces today.&lt;/div&gt;" />
