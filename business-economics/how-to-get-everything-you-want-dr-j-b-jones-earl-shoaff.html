  <title>How to Get Everything You Want - Dr. J. B. Jones, Earl Shoaff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How To Get Everything You Want Out Of Life&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There are basic laws in this universe that will work for you if you know how to apply them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;They work for anyone who knows they exist and how to use them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Millions of people have been taught to believe that the rules of success are indeed so very difficult and complicated that surely they could never learn them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I found out that anyone can be genuinely successful if he will learn the exact same &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; that the successful people learned and use them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We can decide what we want in life in a home, in an automobile, in the clothes we wear, anything that we want in this world--any type of furniture, any type of a home, any type of any thing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Regardless of your background, your lack of education, your lack of knowing anyone who is supposed to be important, your lack of funds, or any other seeming lack,&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;you can still be what you want to be and have what you want to have.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have just one little desire right now that you wish fulfilled and you don&amp;#39;t know exactly how to go about it, then you are ready to learn how to &amp;ldquo;Count to Four&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Phase One is to identify what you want.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Write it down. Define it. Describe it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Develop a keen, clear, distinct mental picture of exactly what you want.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Phase Two is&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;also just a mental exercise, and it doesn&amp;#39;t cost you one red penny.&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Pretend&amp;quot; that you already are what you want to be, and that you already have what you want to have.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ask yourself, &amp;quot;How would I feel if I were already the person I want to be? If I already had the things that I have written down on my Phase One list, how would I feel? What would I do? Where would I be right now?&amp;quot; Assume the feeling of the dream fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Phase Three of this technique is&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;down deep inside you.&amp;quot; Pay no attention to them whatsoever, but keep your thoughts on Phase One and Phase Two.&lt;b&gt;Keep identifying your desires, and keep &amp;quot;living in the feeling of having already attained them.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn to say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot; Yes, you can control your attention units. You can learn to say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to anything which will hinder the fulfillment of your dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Phase Four is&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;the HOW!&lt;br /&gt;
How do you get from here and now, to there, and what you want to be, and have what you want to have and not cost you anything?&lt;br /&gt;
How many of you have ever had an idea come to you for &amp;quot;out of the blue?&amp;quot; All of you have, I am absolutely sure. Well, how many of you know just where the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; is located?&lt;br /&gt;
The &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; is&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;your subconscious mind&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Your Subconscious Mind begins to function in a manner that it never has before.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;It begins to add things up for you. It tells you in the form of ideas, out of the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; and in the form of feelings and urges that you should begin to study in a certain field, perhaps attend a series of lectures, or read certain books, or...&lt;br /&gt;
You then, one day, find yourself in a new position that you enjoy very much and you are happier than you have ever been in your life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Your dream is a reality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have been told, however, that an education is indispensable and absolutely necessary before one can be successful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;That is not so.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you can count to four&amp;quot;, you can be anything you want to be and can have anything you want to have.&lt;br /&gt;
