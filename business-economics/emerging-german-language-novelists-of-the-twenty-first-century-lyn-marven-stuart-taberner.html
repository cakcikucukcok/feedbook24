  <title>Emerging German-Language Novelists of the Twenty-First Century - Lyn Marven, Stuart Taberner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After the international success in the 1990s of authors such as Bernhard Schlink, Marcel Beyer, and Thomas Brussig, an impressive number of new German-language novelists are making a significant impact. Some, like Karen Duve, Daniel Kehlmann, and Sasa Stanisic, have achieved international recognition; some, like Julia Franck, have won major prizes; others, like Clemens Meyer, Alina Bronsky, and Ilja Trojanow, are truly &quot;emerging authors&quot; who have begun to attract attention. Between them they represent a range of literatures in German, from women&#39;s writing to minority writing (from Turkish immigrants and Eastern Europe), to &quot;pop literature&quot; and perspectives on the former GDR and on Germany&#39;s Nazi past. This volume devotes individual essays to fifteen such writers, examining in detail amajor work of each. Translated excerpts from works by Vladimir Vertlib and Clemens Meyer round out the book, which will be of interest not only to academics and students of English and Comparative Literature in the UK, the US, and beyond, but also to the general reader, for whom titles of texts and quotations are translated.

Biendarra,Stephen Brockmann, Rebecca Braun, Frauke Matthes, Brigid Haines, Julian Preece, Emily Jeremiah, Valerie Heffernan, Barbara Mennel, Heike Bartel, Kate Roy, Andrew Plowman, Sonja E.
