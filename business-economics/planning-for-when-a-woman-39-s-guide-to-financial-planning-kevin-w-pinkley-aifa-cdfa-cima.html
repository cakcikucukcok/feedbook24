  <title>Planning for When: A Woman&#39;s Guide to Financial Planning - Kevin W. Pinkley Aifa®, Cdfa™, Cima®</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It doesn&#39;t matter if they are married, divorced or single: Women tend to put others first.   It could be the result of a maternal gene or simply a natural disposition to view others as more important, but it&#39;s an instinct that makes it more difficult to achieve financial security and independence.   Kevin W. Pinkley, a longtime financial advisor, walks women through the steps they need to take in seeking to build and preserve wealth. Learn how to:   plan for a retirement with the goal of providing a lifestyle that meets your needs;  provide for a loved one in the event of death;  minimize the financial impact of divorce or the death or disability of a spouse; and  engage in difficult conversations with your spouse about money.   Many women shrug off questions about money by saying that their spouses are smart and must have a well thought out plan that will meet their needs. But being smart is different than being wise, and women need to take charge of the future by Planning for When." />
