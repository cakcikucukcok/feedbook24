	&lt;li&gt;Developing new leadership candidates and managers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Providing career development for employees with limited opportunities for promotion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compensating and rewarding employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Playbook will show you how to address your most critical employee challenges while still managing cash flow and the workload demands of the business.

You will learn how career management is a high-value, high-return, low-risk business lever that will retain your employees &amp;ndash; and grow your business.&lt;/p&gt;" />
