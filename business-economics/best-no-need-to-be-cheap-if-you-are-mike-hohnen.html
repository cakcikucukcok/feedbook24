  <title>Best! - No Need to Be Cheap If You Are... - Mike Hohnen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired by the principles developed in the &amp;quot;Service Profit Chain&amp;quot;, Mike Hohnen takes you through each of the steps needed to create an outstanding service business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We live in a world of abundance &amp;ndash; there is plenty of choice everywhere. And since 2008 we have experienced significant drops in demand as consumers became more careful. The result is a widening gap between supply and demand in virtually any category you can imagine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When that happens, many companies have a knee-jerk reaction, and the recipe is more or less always the same: initiate rigorous cost-cutting programmes, reduce staff and/or services, offer discounts in many forms, and increase advertising aggressively. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, however, is the equivalent of trying to steer and brake as your car begins to skid on black ice while going through a sharp curve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you hit that declining demand curve, you need to perform what at first seems like a counter intuitive move: hold your price, increase your services, improve your quality, and narrow your focus in the market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this book, you will not only understand why but also see how you can do that." />
