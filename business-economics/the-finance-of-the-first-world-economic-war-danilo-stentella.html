  <title>The Finance of the First World Economic War - Danilo Stentella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the eve of the outbreak of the world conflict, the Ottoman Empire was most similar in some respects to the current European Union, a decadent entity, but after 683 years of domination, with many internal conflicts, with an unreliable army, weighed down by a self-referential bureaucracy and unable to perform its function. And &amp;quot;there was a nation that promised another nation the land of a third nation&amp;quot;, thus began the tragedy of Israel and in some ways even the Shoah.&lt;br /&gt;
The promises made to the Arabs by the British were not honoured, but this is another story, which closely concerns the geopolitical instability of the Middle East, which still today sees the population suffering the wars that the economic powers play in those territories , literally playing, to dispute their economic interests, continuing to foment the hopes of the various Arab factions and arming their hand, composing and undoing groups under the most varied acronyms, only to then define them terrorists to better sow chaos in the area.&lt;br /&gt;
The final transition from the liberal state to the welfare state was being prepared, even though as a consequence of such a mournful event such as a war, which however had timidly started towards the end of the nineteenth century, with the recognition of the formal equality of citizens.&lt;br /&gt;
On the background of these tragedies moved Jewish banking finance, which pragmatically thrived by financing all the powers deployed on the war theatre." />
