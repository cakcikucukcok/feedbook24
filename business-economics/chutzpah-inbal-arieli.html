      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover the secret behind how Israel, a tiny country with the highest concentration of start-ups per capita worldwide, is raising generations of entrepreneurs who are disrupting markets around the globe and bringing change to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dubbed &amp;#8220;Silicon Wadi,&amp;#8221; Israel ranks third in the World Economic Forum Innovation Rating. Despite its small size, it attracts more venture capital per capita than any other country on the planet. What factors have led to these remarkable achievements, and what secrets do Israeli tech entrepreneurs know that others can learn? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech insider Inbal Arieli goes against the common belief that Israel&amp;#8217;s outstanding economic accomplishments are the byproduct of its technologically advanced military or the result of long-standing Jewish traditions of study and questioning. Rather, Arieli gives credit to the unique way Israelis are raised in a culture that supports creative thinking and risk taking. Growing up within a tribal-like community, Israelis experience childhoods purposely shaped by challenges and risks&amp;#8212;in a culture that encourages and rewards chutzpah. This has helped Israelis develop the courage to pursue unorthodox, and often revolutionary, approaches to change and innovation and is the secret behind the country&amp;#8217;s economic success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chutzpah has given generations of Israelis the courage to break away from conventional thinking, the Israeli concept &lt;em&gt;balagan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;messiness in Hebrew&amp;#8212;is at the root of how Israelis are taught to interact with the world. Instead of following strict rules, &lt;em&gt;balagan&lt;/em&gt; fosters ambiguity, encouraging the development of the skills necessary for dealing with the unpredictability of life and business. Living with &lt;em&gt;balagan&lt;/em&gt; provides Israelis with the opportunity to constantly practice the soft skills defined by the World Economic Forum as the Skills for the Future, as &lt;em&gt;balagan &lt;/em&gt;promotes creativity, problem-solving, and independence&amp;#8212;key characteristics of successful entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing the unique ways in which Israelis parent, educate and acculturate, &lt;em&gt;Chutzpah&lt;/em&gt; offers invaluable insights and proven strategies for success to aspiring entrepreneurs, parents, executives, innovators, and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
