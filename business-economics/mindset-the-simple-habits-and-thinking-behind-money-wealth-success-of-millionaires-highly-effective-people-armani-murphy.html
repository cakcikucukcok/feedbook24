  <title>Mindset: The Simple Habits and Thinking Behind Money, Wealth &amp; Success of Millionaires &amp; Highly Effective People - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Ever wondered what&amp;rsquo;s the thinking behind certain successful people?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Things do not just happen. Things happen just. People who are successful do not simply become successful by accident. Success is a choice, not an accident. However, was the concept of success ever taught in traditional education?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, in poor and middle-class families, success seems to be a bad thing. Success means spending &amp;lsquo;too much time&amp;rsquo; working. Success means that you&amp;rsquo;re obsessive. Success means that you ignore your family. Are these really true?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Mindset: The Simple Habits and Thinking Behind Money, Wealth &amp;amp; Success of Millionaires &amp;amp; Highly Effective People&lt;/i&gt;, we will explore the why behind the how. We will explore the mindset behind the actions and the fuel behind the engine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, you will discover:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The most powerful mindset in the world (fortune 500 companies looks for people with this trait)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;20 tips to develop the most powerful mindset&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The concept of Adversity Quotient and why it might be more important than EQ and IQ&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;7 simple habits to cultivate a successful and wealthy mindset&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The 5 things you must truly embody before having a successful mindset&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The concept of Focused Actions and how it will skyrocket your productivity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And so much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Warren Buffett said it best: &amp;ldquo;The best investment you can make is an investment in yourself&amp;rdquo;. If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to pay $7 for a cup of coffee and not $7 for a better future&amp;hellip; guess what? You&amp;rsquo;ve messed up! And it&amp;rsquo;s time to clear the mess.&lt;br /&gt;
