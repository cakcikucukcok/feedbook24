  <title>Reimagining Work - Rob Biederman, Pat Petitti, Peter Maglathlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thrive in the new economy by leading ahead of the next evolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reimagining Work&lt;/i&gt; is the business leader&#39;s guide to surviving—and thriving—in the new on-demand economy. As the business and workplace environments evolve, traditional management strategies are becoming obsolete; the skilled workforce demands flexibility and more control over their work—things that the major corporations repeatedly fail to offer. Is it any wonder that the best and brightest talent is increasingly moving toward smaller companies with alternative management structures? Companies like Uber, Lyft, Handy, and Task Rabbit? These businesses have seen major success by attracting the right people—by giving them what they want. As the shift continues, businesses will need to change the way they recruit, develop, and train talent. This book shows you how to restructure and reconfigure your current strategy toward one that will help your business not just survive, but &lt;i&gt;grow stronger&lt;/i&gt; in this new environment by offering what top talent demands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Niche spaces like transportation and general labor may have catalyzed the movement toward on-demand, but their influence is spreading and traditional businesses must adapt or die. This book shows you how to turn the shift into an asset for your company by leading through change for the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reconsider your current talent sourcing strategies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Update your team development and training programs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build a flexible workforce that thrives in the &quot;on-demand&quot; economy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop your business to succeed amidst the changing business paradigm&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growth is more than just expansion; it&#39;s also maturation, adaptation, and evolution. Our economy is on the cusp of a seismic shift, and smart businesses will implement change early before the obsolete start falling behind. &lt;i&gt;Reimagining Work&lt;/i&gt; gives you actionable guidance for staying ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
