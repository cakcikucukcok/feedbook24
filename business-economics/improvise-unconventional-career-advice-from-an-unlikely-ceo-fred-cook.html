  <title>Improvise: Unconventional Career Advice from an Unlikely CEO - Fred Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This year alone, 3.2 million U.S. students will graduate from college. Unprecedented percentages of them will move back home, and many will be unable to obtain a job in their fields of study. &lt;I&gt;Improvise&lt;/I&gt; is an inspiring story of how Fred Cook followed an unusual yet fascinating path from young adulthood to the corner office as CEO of the award-winning PR firm GolinHarris. Melding learnings from a lifetime of uncommon experiences with insights from a surprisingly successful corporate career, this book will inspire workers mired in indecision and dimly lit prospects. Following college, Cook was initiated into the business world through a dozen odd jobs, each of which provided valuable insights into the business world and the understanding of how to make the most of even the smallest opportunity. Each chapter delivers a bold truth, supported by relevant episodes from Cook&#39;s personal life and reinforced by his encounters with corporate America. Filled with colorful anecdotes about being punched by a guru, stalked by an intern, and lectured by Steve Jobs, &lt;I&gt;Improvise&lt;/I&gt; is full of hilarious yet poignant moments.&lt;/div&gt;" />
