  <title>Roadmap to Retirement Security - Stephen Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book won&#39;t waste your time.  It explains the fundamentals leading to investment success while avoiding the all-too-common &quot;dumbed-down&quot; information that just tells readers what they already know.  Sophisticated concepts like &quot;marked-to-market&quot; and &quot;the snapback phenomenon&quot; and &quot;Modern Portfolio Theory&quot; are some of the book&#39;s themes that can lead to confidence and success as investors.  
For retirees, the book&#39;s purpose is to provide a do-it-yourself course of action allowing for an &quot;end-run&quot; around the financial services industry with the latter&#39;s excessive costs --- costs that eat up what could otherwise have been more retirement income.  Knowing how to effectively self-manage assets and implement a mix of cost-effective investments is a critical skill for retirees.  Understanding and applying some simple basics will deliver the most on-going income while still combating the disasterous effects of inflation." />
