  <title>Everything Under the Sun: Toward a Brighter Future on a Small Blue Planet - David Suzuki, Ian Hanington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In this compilation of David Suzuki&#39;s latest thoughts and writings, the renowned scientist, author, and broadcaster explores the myriad environmental challenges the world faces and their interconnected causes. In doing so, Suzuki shows that understanding the causes&amp;#151;and recognizing that everything in nature, including us, is interconnected&amp;#151;is crucial to restoring hope for a better future. The solutions are there, he argues; we just need the will to act together to bring about change.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Everything Under the Sun&lt;/I&gt; delves into such provocative topics as the difference between human hunters and other predators, the lessons we must learn from the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the subsequent meltdown of the nuclear reactors, and our dependence on the sun for all of our food and energy&amp;#151;indeed for our very lives. Suzuki also considers the many positive steps people are making today. And he doesn&#39;t shy away from controversial opinion, especially when it comes to taking on those who stand in the way of resolving serious issues like climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Underpinning it all is the recognition that we are blessed to live on a planet that gives us everything we require to live, under a sun that gives us the energy we need to produce food and transport and modern conveniences. But we must protect what we have if we want to survive and prosper.&lt;/div&gt;" />
