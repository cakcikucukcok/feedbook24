  <title>Risk-based authentication A Complete Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What prevents me from making the changes I know will make me a more effective Risk-based authentication leader?  How is the value delivered by Risk-based authentication being measured?  How do you manage and improve your Risk-based authentication work systems to deliver customer value and achieve organizational success and sustainability?  In a project to restructure Risk-based authentication outcomes, which stakeholders would you involve?  Do the Risk-based authentication decisions we make today help people and the planet tomorrow?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Risk-based authentication investments work better.
