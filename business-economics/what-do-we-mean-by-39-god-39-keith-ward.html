  <title>What Do We Mean By &#39;God&#39;? - Keith Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&#39;Language about God is something like the language of poetry - The poetic use of language is not to increase your information about the world. We know facts about the world without having poetry. The use of words in poetry is to evoke in us a certain attitude or way of looking at things or feeling about things...If this is the use of religious language, what sort of view of the world is it trying to convey? I think we might say it is trying to convey that the world is an expression of a reality beyond it...&#39; Keith Ward unpacks the meaning of the word &#39;God&#39; and explains why we need to get rid of the crude and unhelpful assumptions that still abound. A book for all who are curious about how God, and God&#39;s actions, can be understood today. Intended for people looking for answers to life&#39;s biggest questions, this little book of guidance will appeal to anyone, whether believer or non-believer, looking for a quick and easy way into the topic.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
