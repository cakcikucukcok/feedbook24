      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Will team members perform Systemic Design work when assigned and in a timely fashion?  Does Systemic Design analysis show the relationships among important Systemic Design factors?  If substitutes have been appointed, have they been briefed on the Systemic Design goals and received regular communications as to the progress to date?  What vendors make products that address the Systemic Design needs?  How does Systemic Design integrate with other business initiatives?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Systemic Design investments work better.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
