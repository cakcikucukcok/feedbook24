  <title>Generating Talent - José Antonio Marina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Generating Talent: How to Put Intelligence to Work&lt;/I&gt; develops an  innovative model that explains the generation of talent as intelligence  acting in a way that is suitable, brilliant and efficient. It reveals  how it is generated not only in individuals, but in organizations and societies as well.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;«&lt;I&gt;This is an optimistic book. Not optimistic with the slightly flaccid  optimism of self-help books that promise us all that we can become instant millionaires, but optimistic because it describes how  &lt;/I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;neuroscience&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;I&gt; shows our capacities to be even greater than previously thought.&lt;/I&gt;»&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;José Antonio Marina&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Every year, countless studies are published which measure the talent  contained in organizations, countries, and even entire economies.  Unfortunately, in José Antonia Marina&#39;s opinion, all these studies  contain errors in their approach. Talent is mentioned as though it were  a rare and valuable gem that needs to be fought for. It doesn&#39;t matter  if you are talking about the world of business or football: the important thing is to sign the best. The author argues that this  old-fashioned idea, that a particular resource is like a cake we all must share, is the antithesis to &lt;B&gt;a creative vision of intelligence&lt;/B&gt;, capable of invention and of amplifying our  possibilities, our wealth and our talent.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;José Antonio Marina offers us in &lt;I&gt;Talent Generation&lt;/I&gt; tips on how  to think better, feel better, make better decisions and implement them  with more determination. This is the journey that the reader will take through this book.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
