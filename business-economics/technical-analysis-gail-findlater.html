  <title>Technical Analysis - Gail Findlater</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A must have guide for identifying chart patterns  for novices and experienced traders alike. 
Technical trading clues off of commodity charts enable enthusiasts to trade futures commodities and stocks efficiently and effectively.
While observing the yearly and daily charts  you will notice the same patterns occur repeatedlyand may even show on the daily and hourly charts. The High, Low, Close of the day that you see is not the whole story as there are minute to minute fluctuations that also form patterns that provide clues as to how the market may react! 
Call it divination if you like but knowing what is happening in advance offers the charting enthusiast time to make a plan and institute it instead of being in reaction mode like fundamental  traders are prone to be or just all out guessing!
THE TRICK IS TO AQUIRE THE SKILLS TO IDENTIFY THESE PATTERNS AS THEY DEVELOP! 
The goal of this &quot;Technical Analysis&quot; reference  is intended to help the technical trader identify patterns as they occur and use this skill to their advantage!
This book is a perfect gift for yourself, the person in your life that is interested in learning the techniques and &quot;lingo&quot; to get started in this fascinating business or the person who is actively trading.  It provides a quick visual review of the patterns in the gallery and a trade tracker for easy review of your trades whether you are paper trading or seriously committed.
Once you read this reference guide you will want to keep it within easy reach during your daily market watch especially if you have a trade in progress." />
