      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The ONE Thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; has made more than 275 appearances on national bestseller lists, including #1 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal, New&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;York Times, and USA Today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It won 12 book awards, has been translated into 26 languages, chosen as one of the Top 5 Business Books of 2013 by Hudson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s Booksellers and one of Top 30 Business Books of 2013 by Executive Book Summaries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Voted one of Top 100 Business Books of All Time on Goodreads. People are using this simple, powerful concept to focus on what matters most in their personal and work lives. Companies are helping their employees be more productive with study groups, training, and coaching. Sales teams are boosting sales. Churches are conducting classes and recommending for their members. By focusing their energy on one thing at a time people are living more rewarding lives by building their careers, strengthening their finances, losing weight and getting in shape, deepening their faith, and nurturing stronger marriages and personal relationships.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;YOU WANT LESS. You want fewer distractions and less on your plate. The daily barrage of e-mails, texts, tweets, messages, and meetings distract you and stress you out. The simultaneous demands of work and family are taking a toll. And what&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s the cost? Second-rate work, missed deadlines, smaller paychecks, fewer promotions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and lots of stress. AND YOU WANT MORE. You want more productivity from your work. More income for a better lifestyle. You want more satisfaction from life, and more time for yourself, your family, and your friends. NOW YOU CAN HAVE BOTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LESS AND MORE.
