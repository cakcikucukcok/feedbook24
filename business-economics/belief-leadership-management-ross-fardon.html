  <title>Belief, Leadership &amp; Management - Ross Fardon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a re-casting for the public service of The Blue Book of Leadership and Management. See that site in this Bookstore.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Between being an executive in many large and small companies, Ross had his most rewarding management experience as a CEO and later consulting, in the public service. It is a high and vital calling if we get our beliefs, values and management right.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In two years, these ways took a good but second-rank department to be rated best in the world, and by example and advice, soon reformed the way mines departments work, throughout Australia and in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, bureaucracy is out of hand in the public services, and this book is worth billions in savings and more in effectiveness. Yes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It takes belief in people and the public good we provide, and commitment to excellence, to another level. This is how, told in engaging and direct words.&lt;/p&gt;
