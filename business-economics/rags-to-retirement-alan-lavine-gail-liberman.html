  <title>Rags to Retirement - Alan Lavine, Gail Liberman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wondering where youre going to get the $1,000,000 experts 
say you
need to retire? Join the crowd.&lt;p&gt;
Meet 12 ordinary people who found ways to meet their 
retirement goals, without
sizable nest eggs. Authors Alan Lavine and Gail Liberman describe 
the journeys these
people took to achieve their dreams and the setbacks they 
experienced along the way.&lt;p&gt;
Yes, you can retire. Learn how others did it, and how they are 
living the good life on
less.-Evan Simonoff , editor in chief, &lt;i&gt;Financial 
Advisor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Real world! Real people! A must read. You can learn how 
people like yourself made
the most of their retirement savings.-James A. Barry Jr., CFP 
chairman of the Barry
Financial Group and host of &lt;i&gt;Jim Barrys Financial 
Successon&lt;/i&gt; PBS&lt;p&gt;
Ill tell you whats so good about &lt;i&gt;Rags to Retirement&lt;/i&gt;, 
what distinguishes it from the
long catalogue of damnably boring fi nance books out there. Ill 
tell you why it matters.
Simple really. Its about story, not accounting. Its about people, 
not money!
People like you and me. Were not rich, never will be. We 
should have taken Economics
101, but we took Latin or geography, and now were facing our 
golden years with
trepidation and empty pockets. Well, take heart, folks. We 
dont need a million in
the bank, but we do need to live creatively. Thats the lesson in 
these refreshing and
moving stories of people whove led hardscrabble lives and have 
somehow managed to
settle with dignity and independence into their golden years. 
And we can do it, too!
&lt;i&gt;Rags to Retirement&lt;/i&gt;: such stuff as dreams are made 
on.-John Dufresne, author of &lt;i&gt;Deep
