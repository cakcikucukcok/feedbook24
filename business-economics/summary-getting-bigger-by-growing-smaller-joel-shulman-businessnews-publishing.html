  <title>Summary: Getting Bigger By Growing Smaller - Joel Shulman - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “GETTING BIGGER BY GROWING SMALLER: A New Growth Model For Corporate America” by Joel Shulman.Joel Shulman is associate professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College. A graduate of Harvard, he specializes in providing training for investment professionals. In addition, Joel Shulman has consulted for the World Bank where he assisted with the development of capital markets throughout Central Asia and in the former Soviet Union. Companies today need a smarter way to grow. The traditional approach of focusing on major investments or acquisitions is running out of steam. The most fertile place to look for the growth of the future is actually in small entrepreneurial initiatives and ideas which take advantage of the established firm’s research and development capabilities, but which will not be burdened by the bureaucracy of the established corporation.According to Shulamn, what’s needed are new commercial entities called Strategic Entrepreneurial Units (SEU). SEUs capture the best of both worlds – the new venture will be able to make its own decisions and establish its own strategic direction but at the same time take advantage of the established corporation’s access to capital, established relationships and other infrastructure assets. Getting Bigger By Growing Smaller offers practical guidance for implementing SEUs.  An thought-provoking book about a powerful new growth model." />
