  <title>The Practice of Managerial Leadership - Nancy R. Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Practice of Managerial Leadership describes a total system for managing organizations.  This practical system is made up of a integrated set of principles, practices and procedures.  The concepts in the system are logical and consistent and have been developed over 50 years by Dr. Elliott Jaques and his colleagues in 15 countries, through continuing consulting research work in organizations. 
Dr. Jaques called this system Requisite Organization.  He chose the term requisite to describe this integrated theory of how organizations work best because requisite means as required by the nature of things.  The ideas contained in Requisite Organization theory and practice flow from the nature of thingsthe nature of people, the nature of work and the nature of the relationship between the two.
Nancy Lee worked with Dr. Jaques for more than two decades and he edited the material in this book for accuracy in providing a detailed description of Requisite Organization.
Managerial hierarchies exist to get work done in order to achieve their goals.  Achieving these goals requires an organization that is appropriately structured, competent individuals at each organizational level, and procedures and practices that facilitate the work.  This book deals with organizations that employ peoplemanagerial hierarchies where accountability is delegated  through the organization from the owners/board members.  People are employed within these managerial hierarchies as individuals (not as teams or as partners) to do the work required.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The material in the book is largely focused on the role of the manager because that is where most of the guidelines are needed in order to accomplish the work of the organization.  It is the work of managers that determines the results achieved with the available resources.  Requisite practices enable decisive, accountable, value-adding managerial leadership throughout the organization.  There is also information on the roles and accountabilities of non-managerial subordinates.  Each employee needs to understand fully his or her own role and the organizations structure and practices.  All of the principles in Requisite Organization are intended to enhance trust between employees in the organization and employees and the organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Trust and understanding are further enhanced in Requisite Organization by the explicit definition of commonly used business terms such as work. role and manager that are generally ill- defined and ambiguous.  Describing requisite practices and procedures in a consistent language that everyone understands provides clarity about what should be done and how to do it.  The book contains a glossary defining important words and concepts used in managerial work.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book is written for managers in all types of managerial hierarchies including commercial, not-for-profit and governmental.  The ideas are equally useful for managers at all levels in organizations.  The principles and practices about managerial leadership described in detail in this book have been tested and put into practice in organizations throughout the world.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book introduces the material contained in Dr. Jaques&#39; books, Social Power and the CEO and Requisite Organization: A Total System for Effective Managerial Organization and Managerial Leadership for the 21st Century, as well as his series of video tapes about Requisite Organization.  The chapters in this book are organized in a manner similar to the videotapes so that they can be used together, if desired. The videotapes can be ordered from Cason Hall Publishers at 800-448-7357.
