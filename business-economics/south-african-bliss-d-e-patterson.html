  <title>South African Bliss - D.E. Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="South African Bliss includes the experiences of Dr. Tim Martin, when he became a Visiting Professor of Entrepreneurship at the University of South Africa in Pretoria. His first assignment was to set up an entrepreneurship program like he established in America. He received two additional assignments from the UNISA Dean: help train black individuals to become good administrators in government and to be good executives in business. The requests were needed, but such training services requested were to be considered as free services by the university as a payback for the inhumane treatment of black people during the Apartheid Era. Dr. Martins other delightful chore was to tutor a hot, young, blond, fashion model, professor who was expected to operate the entrepreneurship program at UNISA. Taming her ardeur and satisfying several other wild women there afforded Tim some most unusual erotic experiences of his lifetime." />
