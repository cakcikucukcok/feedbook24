  <title>Critical Financial Review - Kenny Tay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about financial information that every one of us receives from time to time in the course of our work, business, or as investors in corporate securities, such as shares and bonds. Financial information about a company and its activities is necessary for us to make judgments and decisions regarding financing, investments, and take appropriate management actions. In particular, it is written to complement credit executives with limited accounting experiences or knowledge and who have credit and lending responsibilities.
I have written this book using my personal experiences as a financial skills training facilitator for over twenty years, and the comments of many of my course participants have given me the encouragement to organize my thoughts and views on financial information analysis and my approach in developing understanding of corporate financial numbers, particularly for people from non-financial backgrounds like engineers and lawyers. I hope this book can be of assistance to the people similar to those audiences I have been speaking to during my various training workshops on the subject." />
