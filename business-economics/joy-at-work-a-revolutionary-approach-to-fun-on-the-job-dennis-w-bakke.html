  <title>Joy at Work: A Revolutionary Approach To Fun on the Job - Dennis W. Bakke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Imagine a company where people love coming to work and are highly productive on a daily basis. Imagine a company whose top executives, in a quest to create the most &quot;fun&quot; workplace ever, obliterate labor-management divisions and push decision-making responsibility down to the plant floor. Could such a company compete in today&#39;s bottom-line corporate world? Could it even turn a profit? Well, imagine no more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Joy at Work&lt;/I&gt;, Dennis W. Bakke tells the true story of this extraordinary company--and how, as its co-founder and longtime CEO, he challenged the business establishment with revolutionary ideas that could remake America&#39;s organizations. It is the story of AES, whose business model and operating ethos -&quot;let&#39;s have fun&quot;-were conceived during a 90-minute car ride from Annapolis, Maryland, to Washington, D.C. In the next two decades, it became a worldwide energy giant with 40,000 employees in 31 countries and revenues of $8.6 billion. It&#39;s a remarkable tale told by a remarkable man: Bakke, a farm boy who was shaped by his religious faith, his years at Harvard Business School, and his experience working for the Federal Energy Administration. He rejects workplace drudgery as a noxious remnant of the Industrial Revolution. He believes work should be fun, and at AES he set out to prove it could be. Bakke sought not the empty &quot;fun&quot; of the Friday beer blast but the joy of a workplace where every person, from custodian to CEO, has the power to use his or her God-given talents free of needless corporate bureaucracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Joy at Work&lt;/I&gt;, Bakke tells how he helped create a company where every decision made at the top was lamented as a lost chance to delegate responsibility--and where all employees were encouraged to take the &quot;game-winning shot,&quot; even when it wasn&#39;t a slam-dunk. Perhaps Bakke&#39;s most radical stand was his struggle to break the stranglehold of &quot;creating shareholder value&quot; on the corporate mind-set and replace it with more timeless values:&amp;#160;integrity, fairness, social responsibility, and a sense of fun.&lt;/div&gt;" />
