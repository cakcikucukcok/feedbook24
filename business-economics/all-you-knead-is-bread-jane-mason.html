  <title>All You Knead is Bread - Jane Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All You Knead is Bread, photographed by Peter Cassidy, aims to inspire you to start baking by explaining the basic techniques, demystifying the process and showing you, with step-by-step photography, how simple it is to make a huge variety of breads. The recipes come from the four corners of the globe, but they all have one thing in common - they are easy to follow and the result is so much better for you than anything you can buy in shops. Choose from more than 50 recipes, such as pitta bread, soda bread, cinnamon buns, cheese rolls, rye bread and corn bread. Spanning wheat and the myriad other grains used from country to country, this book will teach how to make bread and understand its unique ability to bring people together to celebrate, share and enjoy it. Jane Mason, a strategy consultant by background, has had a life-long fascination with bread and learned to bake by working with bakers all over the world. In 2010, she started Virtuous Bread to make it fun and easy for people to make, find and learn about good bread. In addition to baking and teaching professionally, Jane works on a voluntary basis with diverse groups including prisoners and school children, using bread as a catalyst for social change. She established Bread Angels in 2011, to teach people how to set up home bakeries, enabling them to work how and when they want, build their local communities, and earn money both baking and teaching others to bake. Jane speaks and writes about bread and its profound role in our lives over time. This is her first book." />
