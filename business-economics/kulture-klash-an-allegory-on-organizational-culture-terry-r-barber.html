  <title>Kulture Klash: An allegory on organizational culture - Terry R Barber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his book, &quot;Kulture Klash: An Allegory,&quot; Terry Barber uses the site of the Ten Commandments as a battlefield for the modern day confrontation between the good and evil of a hostile takeover in the corporate workplace. It is an allegory that is brilliantly presented for today&#39;s leaders and followers who struggle in their job of trying to make their companies and lives relevant.  Barber highlights three groups of combatants: King Klash, the Enigmatic Emperor, the bad guys in the office, The Troublemakers consisting of The Blamegamers, The Clockwatchers, The Cornercutters and worst of all, The Insidions; and the good guys, the Remnant, The Inspirators, The Encouragamentors, The Creativists, The Integrists and the Passionates who follow their conscience and not corporate politics.  As the battle in the Valley of the Sinai approaches with a fatal hostile takeover imminent, we see the issues plaguing most corporations today and why many of them have failed to reach their potential.   Barber deftly moves the players around like a six thousand old chess game with memorable characters, (King Klash, Garth Odion, Moses Manu, Sabu Suckup, Tutu Aswad, Dante Firestarter, Osman Tota, Soliman Tor and Sabu Jabari, among others.   They are not only colorful names they will be readily recognizable in today&#39;s corporate world.  &quot;Kulture Klash: An Allegory,&quot; is not just a fun read, it is loaded with philosophical, inspirational and practical principles that apply to today&#39;s corporate issues and relationships.   Terry Barber has just invented a creative way of making the problems and solutions clear for the 21st Century employer and employees by bringing in the character pillars of the past to build a foundational future for success today.   It is easy to read, entertaining in its texture and has a wonderful ending, one that any corporate leader or employee would be happy to experience." />
