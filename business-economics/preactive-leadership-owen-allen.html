  <title>Preactive Leadership - Owen Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book says you&#39;re a leader even if you don&#39;t know it. A &quot;leader&quot; is anyone who influences others. So if you&#39;re a teacher, friend, coworker, manager, parent, or any one else who influences others, you&#39;re a leader. The question is, what kind of leader are you? Do you have a positive impact on others? Do you influence people without conflict? This easy-to-read guidebook tells exactly what to do (and what not to do) to be a result-oriented, conflict-free leader. It reveals two basic kinds of leadership: Preactive leaders who act before trouble starts, and Reactive leaders who act after trouble starts. Good leaders are more Preactive than they are Reactive. They do that by finding and acting on the three &quot;Effective-Efficient&quot; situations in their lives and jobs. The techniques in this book came from the author&#39;s consulting career with clients such as General Electric, General Motors, Hilton Hotels, John Deere, Kraft Foods/Sealtest, and Westinghouse Electric. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to be a successful leader." />
