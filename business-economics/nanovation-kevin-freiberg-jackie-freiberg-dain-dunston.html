  <title>Nanovation - Kevin Freiberg, Jackie Freiberg, Dain Dunston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Do you have the eyes, the ears, and the hands to be a Nanovator? You&#39;re about to find out.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In India, entire families?too poor to afford a car?crowd onto a single motor scooter every day to brave the tangled traffic lurching through the streets.&amp;nbsp;One evening Tata Motor&#39;s venerable chairman Ratan Tata witnessed something on those rain-soaked streets that both horrified him and birthed a dream: an overloaded scooter lost traction in a busy intersection and sent several members of the family tumbling across the pavement.&amp;nbsp;In that moment Nanovation took root in Tata&#39;s imagination.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The very idea was supposed to be impossible. A safe and appealing family car for the price of a motor scooter? The experts dismissed it. But Ratan Tata was undeterred.

This is the story of how, in the face of insurmountable odds, Tata Motors created one of the greatest innovations in the auto industry since Model-T.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Nanovation has disrupted an entire industry and changed the game for India forever.
