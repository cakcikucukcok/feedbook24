  <title>Almanacs - Jen Hadfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almanacs: a mythic scrapbook, bag of cats, a one-man band. Almanacs is concerned with lists, rules and archetypes and what they don&#39;t account for.

The central sequence &#39;Lorelei&#39;s Lore&#39; is a road movie in poems, set in the north of Scotland: Ultima Thule, hijacked by elusive sirens and Harrier jets. There&#39;s the ruthless Lorelei, gorgeous Ghosty who&#39;s given up on everything except the Road, and Skerryman, patron saint of bad weather and absence-makes-the-heart-grow-fonder. It&#39;s obsessed with yearning, like the two seas separated by the tip of Shetland &#39;metres apart / and desperate for each other.&#39; Lorelei&#39;s Lore wonders &#39;what&#39;s beautiful?&#39; (tarmac? sheep carcasses? sunburn?) and &#39;where&#39;s your native home?&#39; &#39;A quick mind abroad alone in the ever-changing natural landscape. The language country-rooted, specific, of clear observation: a sophisticated, refreshing country brew. There are many memorable images in the described coquettish dance of nature&#39;s primal forces.
