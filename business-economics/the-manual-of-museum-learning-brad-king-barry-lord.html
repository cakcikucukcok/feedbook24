  <title>The Manual of Museum Learning - Brad King, Barry Lord</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Museum learning is a vital component of the lifelong-learning process. In this new edition of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Manual of Museum Learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, leading museum education professionals offer practical advice for creating successful learning experiences in museums and related institutions (such as galleries, zoos, and botanic gardens) that can attract and intrigue diverse audiences. This second edition focuses on the ways museum staffs (and the departments for which they work) can facilitate the experience in a way that capitalizes on their individual institutional strengths. The goal of this new edition is to provide museums with guidance in developing a strategic approach to their learning programs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new edition identifies different approaches to museum learning and enables museums to find the paths for which they are individually best suited, to help them identify their own unique approaches to facilitating museum learning. Each one&amp;rsquo;s mission and vision, its relationships with institutional and public stakeholders, local cultural and market factors, its individual collection and programmatic strengths, its financial position &amp;ndash; all of these things matter. This second edition aims to help each museum find the right approach to learning for its unique situation by showing them the range of museum &amp;ldquo;personalities&amp;rdquo; in terms of their being learning institutions, what constitutes each type, and what the implications are of choosing one or another approach for a particular museum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
