  <title>Impromptu - Judith Humphrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Be Prepared to Lead in the Moment: Assess, think, and respond on-the-spot&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imprompt&lt;/i&gt;u shows leaders how to think on their feet and respond eloquently in every situation. Never have there been so many opportunities to inspire and influence in everyday situations -- elevator chats, corridor conversations, networking gatherings, meetings, and ceremonial events. Indeed, today the most iconic leadership moments are spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment events that reveal the inner workings of the leader&#39;s mind. When these impromptu opportunities arise, leaders must be able to listen, think, and respond within seconds. They don&#39;t read a script from a page, they convey the narrative that is already in their mind. They can tailor a message—in a meeting, in the corridor, or in a tweet—to influence and inspire any audience. Those who shine in that moment are remembered for their leadership. Those who stumble are remembered for their gaffes, mixed messages, or insensitivity. N&lt;i&gt;obody&lt;/i&gt; remembers the leaders who retreat to their office, formulate a strategic plan, and distribute a memo the following week. &lt;p&gt;Guided by her entrepreneurial success as founder of The Humphrey Group and her firm&#39;s work with tens of thousands of leaders over the past 30 years, Judith Humphrey makes clear the &lt;i&gt;importance of preparing to be spontaneous&lt;/i&gt; -- as counterintuitive as that may sound! Drawing upon the best impromptu moments from the Greeks to the present, the book looks at every aspect of impromptu speaking. You will learn how to: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Think like an impromptu leader&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quickly read an audience of one or a thousand&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collect your thoughts and craft a persuasive message&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&#39;Script&#39; yourself within seconds for any occasion&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Avoid &#39;um&#39;s&#39; and &#39;ah&#39;s&#39; and use the right words at the right time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover improv techniques that will enable you to shine&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Deliver your message with clarity, confidence, and conviction.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ability to speak on the spot is often seen as an innate gift, a talent of &#39;natural-born&#39; leaders. The truth is, it&#39;s a skill that can be learned—a skill that is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone in a leadership position. &lt;i&gt;Impromptu&lt;/i&gt; provides clear, actionable guidance to help you reach your full leadership potential. It will enable you to influence and inspire followers on the many &#39;small stages&#39; that define our daily lives." />
