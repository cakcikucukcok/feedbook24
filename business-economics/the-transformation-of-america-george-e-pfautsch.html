  <title>The Transformation of America - George E Pfautsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government&quot;. That observation was made by our third president, Thomas Jefferson. He also made the statement that &quot;The course of history shows that as government grows,
liberty decreases&quot;. This book chronicles the steady growth of our  government since this nation was founded. It also notes the manner in  which that growth has diminished the liberty of this nation&#39;s citizens.  Each reader of this book and each citizen of this nation will decide for themselves the degree to which human life and happiness has been impacted by the growth of this nation&#39;s government over the course of its 236 year history. Our first president, George Washington in his farewell address to the nation stated that &quot;Reason and experience forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle&quot;. This book will also review how the diminishment of the national morality in this nation has impacted the growth of government and the citizens of this nation." />
