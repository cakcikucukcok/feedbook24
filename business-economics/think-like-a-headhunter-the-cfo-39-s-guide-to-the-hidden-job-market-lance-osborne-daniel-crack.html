  <title>Think Like a Headhunter: The CFO&#39;s Guide to the Hidden Job Market - Lance Osborne, Daniel Crack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don&amp;rsquo;t take.&amp;quot; -- Wayne Gretzky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Effective job hunting is all about making opportunities to tell your story as often as you can. This guide will help you find the companies that may want to hear your story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCOVER HOW TO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take advantage of how SMEs actually hire CFOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craft a resume that will get their attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand apart from your competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid making a bad move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, the biggest demand for financial executives doesn&amp;#39;t come from the companies found in the Report on Business 1000 or Financial Post 500. The biggest market for senior financial talent comes from the world of small and medium sized enterprises. There is a healthy demand for CFOs in SMEs but this market is largely hidden from view. How smaller companies recruit for their CFOs is very different from how large companies recruit their financial talent. Lance Osborne has been recruiting financial executives for over twenty-five years and has gained unique insight into how the job market for CFOs in SMEs actually works. Think Like a Headhunter pulls aside the curtain on the how this market operates and offers practical advice on how to access the CFO positions that most financial executives never get to hear about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author -- Lance Osborne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lance has been the acknowledged leader in the recruitment of finance and accounting executives since 1985. Lance founded Lannick Associates, pioneering the business of professional, executive recruitment in the accounting and finance market. Over the course of twenty-five years, Lance built the Lannick Group of Companies into the premier recruitment firm in the market. Lance sold his interest in Lannick Group and left in 2008 to embark on what turned out to be a failed attempt at retirement. In 2013, Lance re-entered the search business with Osborne Financial Search, an executive search practice focusing on CFO searches for small and medium size enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;" />
