  <title>When Bad Things Happen to Good Organizations: How Effective Manager&#39;s Prepare for Crisis - Starr Mayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN--discusses the dreaded possibility that a crisis might strike a nonprofit group. Defining a crisis as an event which threatens the existence of the organization, &quot;When Bad Things Happen to Good Organizations&quot; goes on to discuss prevention and cure by focusing on policies and people. While other books offer management advice to nonprofits or discuss organizational development, &quot;When Bad Things Happen to Good Organizations&quot; is a vital resource for every nonprofit which might encounter a disaster--which is to say, every nonprofit organization. The focus on policies and on people (board and staff) is from the discrete perspective of preventing crises which might be prevented and mitigating the damage of those which cannot. &quot;When Bad Things Happen to Good Organizations&quot; will bring peace of mind to leaders of nonprofits, whether they be executives or boards or pastors or councils. It is practical and can be implemented easily." />
