The money goes to pay high interest. I got deeper and deeper into the debt sink hole. I was frustrated and depressed about my situation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That experience motivated me to do everything to get myself out of debt.

It took me more than a year to get out of debt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of this painful experience, come this book. From all these experiences and research , I developed the strategies to get out of debt and live a debt free life. It worked for me.
