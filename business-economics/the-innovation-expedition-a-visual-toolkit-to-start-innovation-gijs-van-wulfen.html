  <title>The Innovation Expedition: A Visual Toolkit to Start Innovation - Gijs van Wulfen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is one of the first books on the market that deals with the difficult, fuzzy front end of innovation in a very visual way. This makes it a very inspiring, accessible and practical tool box for anyone interested in getting started with innovation. The Innovation Expedition does for innovation what Alexander Osterwalder&#39;s mega-bestseller Business Model Generation did for business modeling: it makes a complicated business subject accessible by telling the story in a visual way and by being one of the first books on the market to present a tried and tested method specifically for the front end of innovation. The book is based on the metaphor of the innovation process as an exciting expedition. In 9 steps and with the help of maps of islands to be explored the author takes the reader along on a journey towards concrete, ready-to-implement concepts for innovative products and services. Along the way you learn how to tackle setbacks, unexpected disasters, dramatic moments and how to make the right decisions.  Gijs van Wulfen is an internationally acclaimed innovation specialist, author, blogger and speaker. In 2012, he was chosen by LinkedIn as one of their 150 thought leaders and he is number 2 on the International Top 40 Innovation Bloggers list of 2012." />
