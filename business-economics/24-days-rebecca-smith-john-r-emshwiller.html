  <title>24 Days - Rebecca Smith, John R. Emshwiller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller, the two reporters who led the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s reporting on Enron and uncovered the unorthodox partnerships at the heart of the scandal through skill, luck, and relentless determination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started in August 2001when Emshwiller was assigned to write a supposedly simple article on the unexpected resignation of Enron CEO Jeff Skilling. During his research, Emshwiller uncovered a buried reference to an off-balance-sheet partnership called LJM. Little did he know, this was the start of a fast and furious ride through the remarkable downfall of a once highly-prized company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in an intense, fast paced narrative style, &lt;em&gt;24 Days&lt;/em&gt; tells the gripping story of the colossal collapse of what would become the world&#39;s most notorious corporation. The reader follows along as Smith and Emshwiller continue to uncover new partnerships and self-dealing among the highest levels of Enron&#39;s management. As they publish articles detailing their findings in the Journal, Wall Street and individual investors have a crisis of confidence and start selling Enron stock at unprecedented levels of volume. In the end - 24 short days later - Enron had completely collapsed, erasing 16 years of growth and losing $19 billion in market value while watching the stock drop from $33.84 to $8.41. Not only was the company destroyed, but investors and retired employees were completely wiped out-all the while Enron executives were collecting millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climaxing with this 24-day period, this book shows the reporter&#39;s-eye view of a David-and-Goliath battle between journalists and a giant corporation. Each day a new story uncovered another fact; each day the company issued denials. And when the investigative stories reached critical mass and momentum, the stock market cast its final vote of no confidence. In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Indecent Exposure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Barbarians at the Gate&lt;/em&gt;, two other gripping narratives that began as a series of Wall Street Journal stories and ended up as books that defined an era, &lt;em&gt;24 Days&lt;/em&gt; brings the importance of great investigative journalism to life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
