  <title>How to Make Money Teaching Online with Your Camcorder and Pc - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What Can You Teach Online from Home Using Your Camcorder, Personal Computer and the Internet?
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can teach almost any subject online, on the Web at Blackboard.com, (http://www.blackboard.com) for a university, community college, continuing education department, or in adult education, or for yourself as an independent contractor in your own personal broadcasting network?
&lt;p&gt;Blackboard is where I teach. Founded to transform the Internet into a powerful environment for teaching and learning, Blackboard traces its technology roots to Cornell University. Today, thousands of institutions in 140 countries deliver e-Education services through Blackboard&#39;s suite of enterprise systems. 
&lt;p&gt;If you put up a course at Blackboard.com on the Web or for any similar type of teaching area on the Web, you can teach online independently without anyone hiring you as a teacher. You are an independent consultant, a trainer, an independent contractor, or you can start your own school or one course online and teach.
&lt;p&gt;This book is about using your personal computer and your camcorder linked together to teach online from your home any subject you are able to teach, have expertise in, or enjoy researching.
&lt;p&gt;This can be a hobby, what you have studied and are credentialed or licensed, or any how-to subject. You can teach writing, using a camcorder, public speaking, or any technology that you have worked with and have expert knowledge of in a home-based online office." />
