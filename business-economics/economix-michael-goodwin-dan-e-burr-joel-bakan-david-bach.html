If I were compiling a list of the 100 most important books you can read in a lifetime, this would be on it.”</p><p> —<b>Stephen Petranek</b>, editor-in-chief, Weider History magazines, former editor-in-chief of <i>Discover</i> magazine</p><p> “Through a potent mix of comics and punchy, concise, accessible prose, Goodwin takes us on a provocative, exhaustively researched, and exceedingly engaging trip through our history and present day, creating an alternately hilarious and scary picture of where we are today as an economy<b>— </b>and what it all means. More than that, Goodwin makes the arcane, understandable. If your mind either spins or slumbers at the thought of economics, read Goodwin's <i>Economix</i> and all will become clear.</p><p><b>—</b><b>Nomi Prins</b>, author of <i>It Takes a Pillage: An Epic Tale of Power, Deceit, and Untold Trillions</i></p><p> “<i>Economix</i> is a lively, cheerfully opinionated romp through the historical and intellectual foundations of our current economy and our current economic problems. Goodwin has a knack for distilling complex ideas and events in ways that invite the reader to follow the big picture without losing track of what actually happened. Any reader wondering how our economy got to where it is today will find this a refreshing overview.”</p><p> —<b>Timothy W. Guinnane</b>, Philip Golden Bartlett Professor of Economic History, Yale University</p>
