  <title>The Twelve Laws of Leadership - Dr. Marc B. Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Recognizing and complying with the twelve laws of leadership will directly impact you being a better leader
more powerful, more thoughtful, more commanding, more connected. Following the twelve laws of leadership will enable you to convert your vision into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive sat in the CEO chair for many years and leadership is a complex and ever changing challenge. I believe that often the hardest thing to do is to fi nd the simplicity that lies beyond complexity. Marc has done it here with his laws of leadership. Read it, highlight and keep it close at hand because you will be back to it again and again&lt;/p&gt; 
(Stephen C. Bilt, CEO, OneSmile, LLC &amp; Smile Brands Inc.).
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cooper has created a superb skeleton upon which a dynamic, charismatic, and effective leader can be built. Within each law is created a new muscle, nerve connection and vital vessel connecting each to another. The whole vision of leadership in this century will rest upon these laws. Your success is now; the twelve laws are the wheels to being motion &lt;/p&gt;
(Dr. Robert E. Chavez, chairman, ARCH Orthodontics).
&lt;p&gt;This will be the leaders bedside bookone to go back to daily, revisiting the 12 laws and their influence, as part of a daily reflection on decisions and their outcomes. Leadership takes effort and commitment, and the 12 Laws of Leadership are the challenges to anyone aspiring to better leadershipthe pieces of the leadership grit puzzle put together in a succinct and powerful book 
(Dr. Andrea Shepperson, dental clinician, educator, and clinical consultant, Lumino The Dentists).
Its empowering to have information on how to grow a successful group practice. However, this information is useless without effective leadership. Dr. Marc Cooper s Twelve Laws of Leadership provides clear guidance and direction to become a better leader. I have found it helpful to periodically go back and review these laws to ensure Im on track as a leader in running my endodontic enterprise&lt;/p&gt;
