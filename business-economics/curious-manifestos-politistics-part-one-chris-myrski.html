  <title>Curious Manifestos : (Politistics) Part One - Chris Myrski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This genre I have named &quot;politistics&quot;, as everything that can be said about the social politics, what here means political SF or various utopias, but critique of the democracy, too. The book looks like collection of Manifestoes of dozen political parties (plus 2 supplements). They are quite different in their character, mainly ironical or even satirical, but entirely reasonable and scientifically sound. Must be said, though, that this is not entertaining reading, unless you find pleasure in the mere reasoning. |  All Manifestos are different, they are not related one with the other, and in some places contradict one to the other, as it is normal for different parties. Their initials, which in Bulgarian original are 3 equal letters (but this is rarely maintained here), are the following: DDD, EEE, ZSG, IIE, CCW, NNO, FCP, BRD, USC, TTT, FFF, and CCC; plus some sentences in the Afterword, as also the Supplement &quot;Hurray, is it possible?&quot;. Here the book is divided in 2 parts in the middle." />
