      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;This inspiring book by leading voice coach Judy Apps shows you how to awaken the energy of your authentic voice to speak from head, heart, gut and soul. Bringing together knowledge from voice training, NLP, Aikido, Alexander Technique, Bioenergetics, Feldenkrais and other mind-body work, Voice of Inf uence gives you the means to reach people at a deeper level where you&amp;amp;#8217;ll motivate and inspire. Through this journey of discovery, you will literally &amp;amp;#145;find your own voice&amp;amp;#8217; in all senses of the phrase. Judy will show you how to: speak more powerfully and influentially; communicate from the whole of you, and reach people at a deeper level; find your true voice rather than just speaking with expression; understand other people better through the sound of their voice. Your voice is uniquely you and reveals more about you than you might imagine. Your whole history is imprinted in your voice. We have all heard of &amp;amp;#145;body language&amp;amp;#8217; this book reveals the &amp;amp;#145;body language&amp;amp;#8217; of sound - &amp;amp;#145;voice language&amp;amp;#8217;. It uncovers many startling new aspects of the human voice and how we communicate - and fail to communicate! Every sound you make gives information about what is going on inside you, and you can use this information both to become a more skilful listener and to communicate with greater impact.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
