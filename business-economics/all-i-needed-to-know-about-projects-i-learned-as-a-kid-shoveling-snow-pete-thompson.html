  <title>All I Needed to Know About Projects, I Learned as a Kid Shoveling Snow - Pete Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; [...] it didnt matter, because one word, sure in the context of motorcycle ownership, gave Pete permission to buy one. All he had to do now was earn the money. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ms. Strickland answered the door she looked at the stoop and noticed that it had been shoveled. Since they were both holding shovels, the first thing she said in a rhetorical tone was Did you guys do that? Thank you! Before they could get a word out, she continued with I guess you are here to shovel my drive! Or did you do that too and now you want your money? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without missing a beat, Mel replied, Yup! Twenty bucks! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a scolding almost frantic tone she replied with, Well Im not paying. I have the lawn service under contract. Not very smart business boys. You cant just ask people to pay for a service they didnt request! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete just stood there in shock when Mel said, OK, well put it back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She paused for a moment with a look of horror on her face until she realized Mel was joking and started laughing. She said Im sorry boys, but Im already committed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mel replied, Thats OK, we understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were walking toward the next house, they heard Ms. Stricklands door open and she started yelling, Boys!? Boys!? Wait! Mel and Pete exchanged glances wondering what now? Come back! I changed my mind! You can shovel my drive! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete jokingly said to Mel, It looks like were both gonna make $20 on this drive since our price just doubled! &lt;/p&gt;" />
