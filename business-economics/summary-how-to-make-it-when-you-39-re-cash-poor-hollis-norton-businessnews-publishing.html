He explains how to invest when you have no money, how to research your market, how to calculate real market value and how to talk intelligently to sellers. He tackles possible problems and most importantly of all, Norton sets out a long-term strategy whereby property can become your most profitable pension.&lt;br&gt;In short, real estate management and wealth creation isn’t complicated, even in today’s climate.
