  <title>Connected Strategy - Nicolaj Siggelkow, Christian Terwiesch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things, robo investment advisers, wearable fitness devices, remote health care operations . . . business executives in many industries are currently being inundated with a confusingly and exhaustingly broad range of technological developments that enable new business models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a common thread among all of these developments: firms are fundamentally changing how they connect with their customers. Rather than having occasional, episodic interactions--where customers realize they have an unmet need and then look for ways to fill it--firms are striving to be continuously connected to their customers, providing services and products as the needs arise, even before customers become aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms such as Nike, Disney, Progressive Insurance, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Medtronic, Hewlett-Packard, and Tesco are developing and competing on &lt;i&gt;connected strategies&lt;/i&gt;: creating superior customer experiences through connectivity while simultaneously driving dramatic improvements in operational efficiencies and reshaping their industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategy and operations experts Nicolaj Siggelkow and Christian Terwiesch reveal the emergence of connected strategies across a broad array of industries and show how these strategies work, how they eliminate the trade-off between superior customer experience and low cost, and how companies can formulate, design, and implement them. In showing how to create a connected strategy, the authors reveal the four pathways--respond-to-desire, curated offerings, coaching, and automatic execution--for turning occasional, episodic interactions into continuous relationships. Siggelkow and Terwiesch show you how to:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reshape the connections between customers, suppliers, and your firm&lt;li&gt;Create the right revenue model&lt;li&gt;Make the best technology choices to support your strategy&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating rich examples, how-to advice, and tools in the form of &quot;workshop chapters&quot; throughout, this book is the ultimate resource for creating connected relationships with your customers and redefining the connections in your industry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
