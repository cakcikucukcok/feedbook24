  <title>Simplicity - Brian J . Rhiness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Effective strategic management brings with it the clarity, accountability, trust, and focus that will dramatically improve your chances of ongoing, sustainable success. To be an effective strategic manager, you develop effective, implementable strategic plans.
Real strategic planning is not an event, nor is it a document that sits on a shelf after an executive retreat to gather dust. Instead it is an ongoing process of accountability and transformation. This book will show you how to create that process inside your organization, ensure the involvement of stakeholders, and make sure strategic priorities are actually implemented.
There is no shortcut to successful strategic planning. It requires full support and commitment from the senior ranks of the organization. You will need to involve as many key stakeholders as possible to ensure buy-in and then unwavering focus on daily execution of the plan. If it sounds like hard work, it is. It requires deep thinking about what your organization stands for, its values and its goals. Just because it is hard work, however, does not mean that you can get someone else to do it for you. Plenty of consulting firms will offer to write your strategic plan for you. Dont let them; to be effective, the plan must be yours. Show those who would attempt to handle everything for you the door.
This book is a distillation of the Rhiness Groups philosophy, showing leaders and managers how to cut through the myths and obfuscations of strategic planning to embrace a powerful and comprehensive process that they can use to transform their organization. It is not a magic bullet or a one size fits all planinstead, it will teach you how to create and implement your strategy, the one that will see you and your organization through an uncertain future to sustainable success." />
