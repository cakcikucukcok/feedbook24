  <title>Branding a Store: How to Build Successful Retail Brands in a Changing Marketplace - Ko Floor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today&#39;s retail landscape is evolving rapidly. Retailers are increasingly becoming brands in their own right. Branding a Store analyses these changes, and the implications for retailers and consumers. This fascinating study demonstrates how retailers can build a strong, independent brand identity to remain competitive in the global marketplace.   Using international examples and case studies, including champion retail brands such as Wal-Mart, Tesco and McDonald&#39;s, the book explains the: • Distinction between retail brands and manufacturer brands; • Challenges faced by retail brands; • Benefits for both the retailer and consumer; • Competitive strategies to grow the brand; • Brand positioning; • Brand personality; • Brand communication.  Finally, the author, an experienced retail consultant, offers insights into the future development of successful retail brands, arguing that the emotional differences between them will become more and more important to the consumer.  Ko Floor has almost 40 years of retail experience. He worked for 10 years in various marketing positions for department stores, specialty stores and supermarkets, then for 20 years for one of the leading advertising agencies in the Netherlands, FHV/BBDO. As retail director he was responsible for developing a number of famous advertising campaigns. He received many awards for building retail trends. He started his own consultancy, Retail Factory, in 1998. His core competence is developing differentiating retail brand identities and translating these into store design, visual merchandising and advertising. Ko Floor has written many articles and books about retail and taught brand management classes at the University of Amsterdam." />
