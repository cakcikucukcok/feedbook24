  <title>A Lawyer&#39;s Case for Network Marketing - Pamela Barnum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this groundbreaking new book, former federal prosecutor Pamela Barnum investigates the often-criticized and misunderstood profession of network marketing. She combines insight learned from twenty years in the criminal justice system with observations made as a professional network marketer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information is delivered with the wit and humor you would expect from someone who transitioned from a career of Breaking Bad to a profession focused on Breaking Busy, and will provide you with a path to the freedom to build your own career. Is the life you&amp;#39;re living worth the price you re paying? Before network marketing, Pamela Barnum&amp;#39;s resounding answer was no. At the time, she was working more than sixty hours a week as an attorney prosecuting drug dealers. She had given up her career as an undercover police officer to get married and start a family. She thought working as a lawyer would be a more family-friendly job. It turns out she had simply traded one demanding career for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a friend introduced her to network marketing, she did what her extensive experience in the criminal justice system taught her to do she investigated. She thought it was one of those pyramid schemes and set out to prove it. This book details what countless hours of research and years of personal experience reveal about network marketing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a network marketer, or someone who is interested in learning more, this book is a compass that will help you find the truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What network marketing is and whether it is a viable business opportunity for you.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the law applies to network marketing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it takes to be successful with network marketing. Why a skeptical lawyer left her career to pursue the profession of network marketing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to look for in a network marketing company.&lt;/p&gt;" />
