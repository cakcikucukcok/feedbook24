  <title>The Layman&#39;s Guide to a Growing Income Stream for Life - Kevin Rust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the low-interest rate environment we currently find ourselves in these days, just putting your hard-earned dollars into a simple savings account at your local bank just wont cut it anymore, if it ever did. The time has come to broaden our horizons a bit and consider ways we have to grow our savings and have our nest egg work for us.
The plan is to explore our options and construct an investment strategy that is tailor-made for each individuals situation and tolerance. A plan that will provide us with a growing income stream that will allow us to provide for ourselves and our loved ones for life while allowing us to rest easy at night.
This book is a blueprint outlining the good and the not-so-good options we all have in an easy-to-understand reference guide you can turn to anytime. We all should have a work ethic in our profession. A good days work for a good days pay. Inside, we expand on that ethic. The pay earned for a good days work will now work for me." />
