  <title>Selling at Fairs - Jim Carsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Listen to these tactics from an experienced vendor who has attended dozens of events.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The author relates his experiences of signing up for local fairs, paying a fee, and trying to talk to people to make a profit. These experiences have helped him and his partner gain insights in selling and marketing. Selling at events is an art by itself. No matter which product you&amp;rsquo;re selling, there are things you need to know about positioning, target groups, approaching people, estimating your costs, and customers&amp;rsquo; behavior that can help you increase your sales and maximize your profits. Take it from a guy who has been there and start listening now so you can save yourself some money and make more with your business as a vendor. Selling to a bunch of mindless sheep walking by, observing things but never having the tendency to pull out their wallet, is difficult, but if you do it the right way, you can actually convince them that your product or service is worth it and make hundreds of dollars each day you are there." />
