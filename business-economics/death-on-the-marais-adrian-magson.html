  <title>Death on the Marais - Adrian Magson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She was going to die. She could feel it, her life ebbing away as surely as fine sand through fingers. France, 1963. It&#39;s a time of great change, not least for Inspector Lucas Rocco. As part of a nationwide &#39;initiative&#39; to broaden police operations, he finds himself moved from the Paris metropolis to a small village. His new patch might be rural, but it&#39;s certainly not uneventful: on his first day, he finds a murdered woman wearing a Gestapo uniform lying in a British military cemetery. When the body is removed by order of a magistrate from the police mortuary before Rocco can finish his investigation, he realises he&#39;s up against a formidable enemy. An enemy who will go to any lengths - even murder - to stop his investigation." />
