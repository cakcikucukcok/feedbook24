  <title>A Practical Handbook for the Boss - Jim Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Successful managers and leaders know that despite what many believe, things dont have to be bigger, faster, and more complicated to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this practical guidebook for bosses, youll learn how to incorporate good old-fashioned values and common sense to help employees achieve goals. Examining how successful leaders overcome challenges will give you the knowledge you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
 inspire confidence in others by being consistent;&lt;/br&gt;
    consider policies before implementing them;&lt;/br&gt;
    communicate with employees instead of harassing them;&lt;/br&gt;
    promote positive attitudes in the workplace.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is small enough to carry with you and includes space throughout so you can write down what type of leader you want to be, what positive attributes will improve your chances of success, what negative traits are holding you back, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you learn management strategies, youll be able to reflect back and apply what youve learned to build better relationships with employees and get them excited about achieving business goals.&lt;/p&gt;
Our world today expects everything to be bigger, longer, faster and more complicated to be successful. We often have the misguided idea that it has to be those things in order to be good. Nothing can be farther from the truth! The problem with this is most people dont have time to jump through all the hoops that many professionals expect in order to be seen as successful. Its time that we got back to some good, old-fashioned values when it comes to supervising other people. A Practical Handbook for the Boss is a short, easy to read handbook that is small enough to carry with you and allows you to be a part of the publication by including your own ideas and successes as an administrator. In other words, it helps you see your own successes and builds on them. Hopefully, it will help you be more sensitive to your employees, more focused on your goals, happier in your personal life, and be a better boss." />
