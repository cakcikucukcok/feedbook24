  <title>Startup Opportunities - Brad Feld, Sean Wise, Chris Sacca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Start strong with essential early-stage guidance from the VC perspective&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Startup Opportunities&lt;/i&gt; is the go-to guide for anyone with a great business idea. Whether it&#39;s your first business or your fifth, realistic assessment from the outset can save you a lot of time and money; why pour your heart and soul into a venture that is doomed to fail? Instead, position yourself to win from the very beginning. In this book, accomplished venture capitalists share their insight on startups and entrepreneurs: who will fail, who will succeed and why, and what you should do to give your business the very best shot at becoming a global success story. You&#39;ll learn how to evaluate your business with a critical eye, and how early customer development can be key in turning a good idea into a great opportunity. If you&#39;re serious about building a business that lasts, this book provides invaluable guidance that you really cannot miss. &lt;p&gt;More than five million people will launch a business this year, and many of them will be great ideas—yet few will be around in five years, and even fewer in ten years. A great idea is not enough to build a successful business. You need to fortify your idea with the proper foundation, and a scaffolding of good planning and early action. This book shows you how. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Assess your business&#39;s viability using the 10x Rule&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn when you can quit your day job—or not&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Take the key steps to making your business succeed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover the opportunities worth selling everything for&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This expert author team has witnessed more than 30,000 pitches over two decades, and have participated in over 500 startup launches. &lt;i&gt;Startup Opportunities&lt;/i&gt; gives you the benefit of their experience to help you start strong and stay strong." />
