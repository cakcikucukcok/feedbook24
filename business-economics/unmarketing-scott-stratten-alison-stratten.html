  <title>UnMarketing - Scott Stratten, Alison Stratten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UnMarket to build trust and make lifelong customers!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2009, Scott Stratten and Alison Stratten wrote the bestselling &lt;i&gt;UnMarketing: Stop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marketing, Start Engaging&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;and began a journey that would take them around the world sharing their message of engagement with corporations, entrepreneurs, and students.They are now back with this second edition, because Everything has Changed and Nothing is Different, with all the brilliance of the first edition, plus new content and commentary to reflect the rapidly changing landscape we all live, buy, and work in today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For generations, marketing has been hypocritical. We&#39;ve been taught to market to others in ways we hate being marketed to (cold-calling, flyers, ads, etc.). So why do we still keep trying the same stale marketing moves?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;UnMarketing&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to unlearn the old ways and consistently attract and engage the right customers. You&#39;ll stop just pushing out your message and praying that it sticks somewhere. Potential and current customers want to be listened to, validated, and have a platform to be heard-especially online. With &lt;i&gt;UnMarketing&lt;/i&gt;, you&#39;ll create a relationship with your customers, and make yourself the logical choice for their needs. We know you&#39;ve been told to act like other people, talk like other people, and market like all the people, but it is time for you to unlearn everything and start to UnMarket yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;UnMarketing&lt;/i&gt; includes the latest information on:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Idea Creation, Viral Marketing and Video, Marketing to Millennials, Authenticity, Transparency and Immediacy, Ethics and Affiliates, Social Media Platforming, UnPodcasting, Word of Mouth, Customer Service, Consumer Advocacy and Leadership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With examples of what to do, and what not to do, from small business right up to worldwide corporations in areas such as real estate, travel, service, retail, and B2B.&lt;/p&gt;" />
