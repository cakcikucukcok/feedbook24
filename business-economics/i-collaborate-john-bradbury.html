  <title>I Collaborate - John Bradbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the workplace, good relationships are the key to making things happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So often poor relationships get in the way of progress and efficient delivery of results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting the collaborative strategies and practices that John has laid out here will enable individuals to problem solve their relationship challenges and thereby create a much better working environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behaviours described here make common sense but are not yet common practice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, taking personal responsibility for the way you lead can strongly influence the development of a collaborative culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a leader who believes that creating the right culture will benefit the business&amp;nbsp;then this book is for you. Engaging with&amp;nbsp;the practices in this book and getting others to engage with them will result in a culture that delivers engaged, motivated employees who deliver exceptional results. Our behaviours and the way we relate to others a significant determinant&amp;nbsp;of the culture we work in. Furthermore the culture is strongly linked to results. It makes sense to address the culture and this book shows you how to do that in a powerful, impactful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I Collaboarte asks you to examine how you lead and make a commitment to transform yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
