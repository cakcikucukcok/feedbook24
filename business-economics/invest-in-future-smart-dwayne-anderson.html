  <title>Invest in Future Smart - Dwayne Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Invest in Future Smart&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to be successful, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to learn to become more intuitive. What the market wants today is not necessarily what it will want tomorrow or the next day, and if you focus on only providing what is required and desired today when tomorrow rolls around, you may find yourself obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;
Not to mention that the world&amp;rsquo;s most successful people have all, in their own way, been pioneers. Developing new, unheard of ways to deliver their products, services, or message, to the world.&lt;br /&gt;
Without that pioneering spirit, we&amp;rsquo;d all still be sitting in a cave, waiting for lightning to strike so we could have a hot meal.&lt;br /&gt;
Paying attention to what the world is going to want, as much as what it wants now, will stand you in good stead when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;
If you are going to lead a significant, meaningful life, you need to become future smart and be part of inventing the future you want for yourself and the world around you. Many people have been caught by surprise in the recent global recession because they thought what they had would always be what they will need to stay ahead in the future. Don&amp;rsquo;t be caught by surprise, become future-smart." />
