  <title>The CIO Edge: Seven Leadership Skills You Need to Drive Results - Graham Waller, Karen Rubenstrunk, George Hallenbeck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Great CIOs consistently exceed key stakeholders&#39; expectations and maximize the business value delivered through their company&#39;s technology. What&#39;s their secret? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sure, IT professionals need technological smarts, plus an understanding of their company&#39;s goals and the competitive landscape. But the best of them possess a far more potent ability: they forge good working relationships with everyone involved in an IT-enabled project, whether it&#39;s introducing new hardware or implementing a major business transformation. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In The CIO Edge, the authors draw on Korn/Ferry International&#39;s extensive empirical data on leadership competencies as well as Gartner&#39;s research on IT trends and the CIO role. They prove that, for IT leaders, mastering seven essential skills yields big results. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This new book lays out the people-to-people leadership competencies that the highest-performing CIOs have in common?including the ability to inspire others, connect with a diverse array of stakeholders, value others&#39; ideas, and manifest caring in their relationships. The authors then explain how to cultivate each defining competency. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Learn these skills, and you&#39;ll get more work done through others&#39;enabling you to successfully execute more IT projects, generate better results for your company, and concentrate your efforts where they&#39;ll exert the most impact. The payoff? As the authors show, you&#39;ll work smarter, not harder--and get promoted far faster than your peers.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
