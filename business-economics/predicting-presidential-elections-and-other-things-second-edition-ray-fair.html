  <title>Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things, Second Edition - Ray Fair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;It&#39;s the economy, stupid,&quot; as Democratic strategist James Carville would say.  After many years of study, Ray C. Fair has found that the state of the economy has a dominant influence on national elections.  Just in time for the 2012 presidential election, this new edition of his classic text, &lt;I&gt;Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things&lt;/I&gt;, provides us with a look into the likely future of our nation&#39;s political landscape—but Fair doesn&#39;t stop there.
Fair puts other national issues under the microscope as well—including congressional elections, Federal Reserve behavior, and inflation.  In addition he covers topics well beyond today&#39;s headlines, as the book takes on questions of more direct, personal interest such as wine quality, predicting football games, and aging effects in baseball.  Which of your friends is most likely to have an extramarital affair?  How important is class attendance for academic performance in college?  How fast can you expect to run a race or perform some physical task at age 55, given your time at age 30?  Read &lt;I&gt;Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things&lt;/I&gt; and find out!
As Fair works his way through an incredibly broad range of questions and topics, he teaches and delights.  The discussion that underlies each chapter topic moves from formulating theories about real world phenomena to lessons on how to analyze data, test theories, and make predictions.  At the end of this book, readers will walk away with more than mere predictions. They will have learned a new approach to thinking about many age-old concerns in public and private life, and will have a myriad of fun facts to share." />
