  <title>Expand Your Sales - Dale Carnegie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Let me ask you a question. The last time you set in motion your own product to sell on the net, or even offline, how did you come to a conclusion about what price you were going to be distributing at?  At a guess, I&#39;d likely say you looked at the rivalry to see what they were charging. While this is a great beginning, it&#39;s far from the whole picture, and you&#39;re fumbling in the dark if you looking at rivalry is the only component you&#39;re taking into account.  Do you understand you are able to double your sales volume by doubling your price? I&#39;ve done it myself, and I&#39;ll demonstrate how.  Do you also understand that 99% of the products I see being sold are too cheap. So much so, that they&#39;re putting buyers off rather than attracting them (which is no doubt what they think they&#39;re doing).  Let&#39;s drive out some pricing myths and dig right down to the real facts to ensure you get the most money." />
