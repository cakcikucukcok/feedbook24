  <title>The Game - Kim Beamon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Working in corporate America is like surviving in the world of sports: there are things to win, theres competition, there are teams and teammates, people play certain positions, managers are coaches, employees have game plans, and the business year is often divided into quarters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At work, the corporate professional is also a business athlete. At work, the corporate professional is actually in a game. At work, the corporate professional is personally responsible to play his position. At work, there is a specific set of rules for the corporate professional to follow. And though the rules may seem unfair, at work, the corporate professional will need to follow the rules to win.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reader is treated as if hes a professional basketball player going into his rookie season. Chapters mirror the players life as an athlete. Before the real work-season starts, the business athlete spends time in pre-season. First and second quarter, halftime, third and fourth quarter reflect the actual activity at work. The off-season represents a time at work when the corporate professional begins to leave his new-hire or rookie status to become a seasoned player. A final chapter offers business advice to keep the corporate professional motivated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The chapter format is simple: business rules followed by explanations, and random mixtures of anecdotes and sports analogies called, Sports Talk. Sports Talk helps to draw comparisons to similar rules or principles in the game of basketball. For concepts that require more details and examples, Appendices are used for reference. The Appendix also includes a recommended book list and a listing of helpful Internet sites.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Game assists the corporate professional in turning unconscious mistakes and blunders into purposeful and directed strategies for success, saving both time and money. For the employeevaluable time making mistakes. For the companylarge amounts of time and money spent paying for those mistakes. In a fast-paced read, what The Game teaches typically takes the corporate professional years to learn and could cost a corporation multiple thousands of dollars to address.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Success in corporate America depends on ones ability to get in the game, master the fundamentals, execute offensively, understand your position, and play to win! The Game is a complete resource for what it takes to win at work. The time spent reading this book will develop, and refine:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mental toughnessWardrobe selectionOrganizational skillsSocial habitsPerformance measurementsRelational skillsPersonal growthFinancial endeavorsProfessional opportunities &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Game is for the reader who is:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Graduating college and entering a professional jobCurrently a new hire within his first 12-24 months at workAn intern or temp seeking permanent employmentOn the job, but suspects something is holding him backAlready working, but needs an edgePreparing to enter the workplace for the first time or again!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Game is a perfect tool to give to the male you know in one of the above categories, especially if you are a(n):&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;ParentRelativeFriendCareer or Guidance CounselorJob Placement SpecialistRecruiterNew-hire TrainerMentorAdvisorManagerHuman Resources Representative&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Im a retired professional athlete and now a businessman.
