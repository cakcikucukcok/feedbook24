  <title>Financial Freedom: How to Master the Money Game, Generate Passive Income &amp; Establish An Unshakeable Portfolio - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aren&amp;rsquo;t you tired of living paycheck to paycheck? Tired of deciding which bills to pay when in order to save yourself an overdraft? You aren&amp;rsquo;t alone, not by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Financial freedom sounds like a pipe dream to most of the world&amp;rsquo;s current population. Not because it&amp;rsquo;s as unattainable as it&amp;rsquo;s made to sound, but because of how much more saturated the markets are and how much less equipped we are to break into them as a whole. Many people think that in order to make money you have to focus all of your time on it and be able to fully devote yourself to doing so. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this what we are taught in school and from the media?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The truth of the matter is that that just isn&amp;rsquo;t the case. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with an entirely new business idea and start it from the ground up in order to manage yourself financially. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend a ton of money on &amp;lsquo;deposits&amp;rsquo; or books with step by step programs. Everything you need is at the click of your fingertips, just waiting for you to discover.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Am I going to have to buy a step-by-step program? No! Absolutely not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is going to teach you how to make and manage your own money in a way that continuously builds, not ask you to buy into some get rich quick scheme that ends up only driving you further into debt in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re going to cover how to start up a passive income, how to get ahead monetarily, saving, investing, building your portfolio, and most importantly, how to keep your progress continuous! Anyone can save a hundred dollars and keep it in the bank, but we&amp;rsquo;re talking about continuously adding to those numbers.&amp;nbsp; This book isn&amp;rsquo;t about fast money, it&amp;rsquo;s about sustainable money- and the easily incorporated practices in which you can finally master your own money instead of allowing it to master you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend money to make money- you need to save it, and save your bank account in the process." />
