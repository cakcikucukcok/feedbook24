  <title>The Employee Experience Advantage - Jacob Morgan, Marshall Goldsmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research Shows Organizations That Focus on Employee Experience Far Outperform Those That Don&#39;t&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently a new type of organization has emerged, one that focuses on employee experiences as a way to drive innovation, increase customer satisfaction, find and hire the best people, make work more engaging, and improve overall performance. &lt;i&gt;The Employee Experience Advantage&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of its kind to tackle this emerging topic that is becoming the #1 priority for business leaders around the world. Although everyone talks about employee experience nobody has really been able to explain concretely what it is and how to go about designing for it...until now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can organizations truly create a place where employees want to show up to work versus need to show up to work? For decades the business world has focused on measuring employee engagement meanwhile global engagement scores remain at an all time low despite all the surveys and institutes that been springing up tackle this problem. Clearly something is not working. Employee engagement has become the short-term adrenaline shot that organizations turn to when they need to increase their engagement scores. Instead, we have to focus on designing employee experiences which is the long term organizational design that leads to engaged employees. This is the only long-term solution. Organizations have been stuck focusing on the cause instead of the effect. The cause is employee experience; the effect is an engaged workforce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backed by an extensive research project that looked at over 150 studies and articles, featured extensive interviews with over 150 executives, and analyzed over 250 global organizations, this book clearly breaks down the three environments that make up every single employee experience at every organization around the world and how to design for them. These are the cultural, technological, and physical environments. This book explores the attributes that organizations need to focus on in each one of these environments to create COOL spaces, ACE technology, and a CELEBRATED culture. Featuring exclusive case studies, unique frameworks, and never before seen research, &lt;i&gt;The Employee Experience Advantage&lt;/i&gt; guides readers on a journey of creating a place where people actually want to show up to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Readers will learn:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The trends shaping employee experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to evaluate their own employee experience using the Employee Experience Score&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What the world&#39;s leading organizations are doing around employee experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to design for technology, culture, and physical spaces&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The role people analytics place in employee experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Frameworks for how to actually create employee experiences&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The role of the gig economy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The future of employee experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nine types of organizations that focus on employee experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no question that engaged employees perform better, aspire higher, and achieve more, but you can&#39;t create employee engagement without designing employee experiences first. It&#39;s time to rethink your strategy and implement a real-world framework that focuses on how to create an organization where people want to show up to work. &lt;i&gt;The Employee Experience Advantage&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;" />
