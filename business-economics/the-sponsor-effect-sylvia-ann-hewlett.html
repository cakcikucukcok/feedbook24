  <title>The Sponsor Effect - Sylvia Ann Hewlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who&#39;s delivering for you? Who has your back? Who’s burnishing your brand and expanding what you can get done in this world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponsorship is a two-way alliance where a leader partners with junior talent to build their skills and advocate for their promotion--all while receiving stellar performance and loyalty in return. Many know the benefit of finding a sponsor: men and women with sponsors are much more likely to progress to the next rung in their careers than those without. But according to author Sylvia Ann Hewlett, &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; a sponsor is just as important to career growth as &lt;i&gt;finding&lt;/i&gt; one. Senior executives who proactively sponsor others are 53 percent more likely to receive a promotion--and middle-level managers who have proteges are 60 percent more likely to receive a stretch assignment--than those who don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you find potential proteges, let alone develop your picks so that they’re able to come through for you and the organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll find the answers in &lt;i&gt;The Sponsor Effect&lt;/i&gt;. Combining powerful new data and vivid narrative drawn from in-depth interviews with leaders from companies such as Google, Blizzard, American Express, and EY, this book provides a seven-step playbook for how leaders can become stand-out sponsors. You&#39;ll learn to:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the right proteges, including those who offer differing perspectives&lt;li&gt;Develop your proteges&#39; skills and ignite their ambition&lt;li&gt;Inspect your picks, so you know they’re delivering for you&lt;li&gt;Make the ask and spell out the terms of your relationship&lt;li&gt;Publicly endorse and advocate for your proteges&lt;li&gt;Leverage that talent to expand your influence and grow your capabilities&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Along the way, Hewlett maps out and measures the enormous benefits for managers and executives who invest in this valuable relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
