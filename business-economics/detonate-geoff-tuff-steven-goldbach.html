      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reinvent best practices that have become bad habits&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without meaning to, and often with the best of intentions, most organizations continually waste precious time and money on processes and activities that don&#39;t create value and no longer make sense in today&#39;s business environment. Until now, the relatively slow speed of marketplace evolution has allowed wasteful habits to continue without consequence. This reality is ending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Detonate&lt;/i&gt; explains how organizations built up bad habits, identifies which ones masquerade as &quot;best practices,&quot; and suggests alternatives that can contribute to winning in the marketplace. With a focus on optimism and empowerment, it focuses on an approach and mindset which are critical to successfully compete in an era characterized by profound technological advances and uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;•    Core themes challenge how you think about and approach problems&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;•    Case studies illustrate the challenges you face and how to overcome them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;•    Recommendations are pragmatic and steer clear of suggesting a brand-new, complicated wiring diagram&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;•    Actionable advice provides the first steps down an evolutionary path&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to compete differently in today’s marketplace and to challenge the things your company does which you have a nagging feeling are actually just a waste of time – and maybe value-destroying – &lt;i&gt;Detonate &lt;/i&gt;gives you what you need to ignite change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
