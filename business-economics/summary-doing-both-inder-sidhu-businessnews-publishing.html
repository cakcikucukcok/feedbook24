Instead, Cisco does both simultaneously. And even more impressively, Cisco has found all kinds  of  advantages  can  be  derived  from  approaching  every decision as an opportunity to seize rather than a sacrifice to be made. The key is to find ways to make one option  benefit  and mutually reinforce the other." />
