  <title>How to Treat New Ideas - David Magellan Horth, Michael T. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Center for Creative Leadership速 publication shows you the important steps you can take to become more self-aware and to treat new ideas and those who suggest them with the respect and consideration they deserve.  Ask any leader about innovation and you are likely to hear how critical it is to their organization. Innovation provides a way to stand out from competitors around the globe and to address ever-rising customer expectations for products, services, and experiences that are new, different, and make life easier. Despite what we say about innovation, how we act is often in direct contradiction to our words. Most of us are quick to see new ideas as a risk- lacking all the evidence and detail we need to make us feel comfortable. Rather than embracing new ideas and nurturing them along the way, we tend to discard them out of hand-sabotaging the very creativity we need to fuel innovation. The six tips described in this publication will inspire &amp; equip any leader to become an innovation hero!" />
