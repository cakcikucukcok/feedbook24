  <title>Strategic Alliances: Three Ways to Make Them Work - Steve Steinhilber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;As a top executive, you&#39;ve almost certainly forged strategic alliances with other companies. Some of these deals have worked--but many others have likely failed. In fact, companies worldwide launch more than two thousand strategic alliances every year, and more than half never deliver as promised.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;EM&gt;Strategic Alliances&lt;/EM&gt;, Steve Steinhilber proves that, despite the odds, alliances are critical to the business strategy for companies competing globally: customers want integrated solutions to their problems, and that&#39;s pushing companies to work together to create differentiated offerings. Equally crucial, well-managed alliances generate important forms of business value, including new products and accelerated growth. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on his experience as the head of Cisco&#39;s Strategic Alliances group, Steinhilber has created tools and guidelines that will help you forge alliances that work. He describes the three essential building blocks of successful alliances and explains how to establish:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The right framework--by articulating how an alliance will help you achieve your company&#39;s strategic business goals and identifying potential partners&lt;BR&gt;The right organization--by staffing your alliance organization with the right people and constantly honing their skills&lt;BR&gt;The right relationships--by cultivating trust among the many key internal contacts in your organization and your alliance partners&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Engaging and authoritative, &lt;EM&gt;Strategic Alliances shows you how to manage strategic partnerships more effectively and maximize their value in a complex and changing business environment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From our new &lt;EM&gt;Memo to the CEO series&lt;/EM&gt;--solutions-focused advice from today&#39;s leading practitioners.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
