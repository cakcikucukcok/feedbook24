  <title>The Entrepreneur’S Edge Ii - Daniel R. Hogan Jr., PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are many reasons for business failure, chief among which is management. Invariably, entrepreneurs / business owners usually blame outside forces for their shortcomings or ill luck. Often the very traits that lead them to launch an entrepreneurial enterprise are the traits that lead to the final demise of their dreams. The internal locus of control and if its going to be its up to me attitude that entrepreneurs possess and acknowledge as a factor of success is rejected as a contributing factor of failure. 
The reason for trouble and a resultant failure is most often attributed to the lack of capital and the lack of the ability, knowledge, and capacity to obtain capital both in the form of debt and equity and, most prevalent, the lack of positive cash flow. 
This book will help the entrepreneur who may be well versed in a given field, expertise, or industry to fill the ever-present task of constantly seeking required capital. In addition to the increasing management, communication, and people skills that the perhaps technically talented enterpriser must soon master is the realization that he/she must also always seek capital if the business is to survive and grow. Capital, working capital, positive cash flow is the lifeblood of the business. Without it, there is no growth, no survival, and no life. In the entrepreneurs enthusiasm, the zeal to achieve the vision, the exhilaration and activity of the moment, the need for money, and a timely positive cash flow are often overlooked. They are the very life force of the business, the oxygen for the venture, without which it will die. 
The Entrepreneurs Edge ll will assist the planning necessary in finding the money, raising the money, making the money, and keeping the money. It, along with the accompanying books in the series (The Entrepreneurs Edge: Finding the Money, The Entrepreneur Manager: The Business Mans Business Plan, The Entrepreneurs Guide to Start, Grow, and Manage a Profitable Business, and Economics Entrepreneurship Ethics : The Es of Business), helps to fill the toolbox necessary for every entrepreneur and business manager." />
