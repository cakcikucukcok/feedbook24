  <title>Digital Sense - Chris J. Snook, Travis Wright, Brian Solis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Compete in the digital world with pragmatic strategies for success&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digital Sense&lt;/i&gt; provides a complete playbook for organizations seeking a more engaged customer experience strategy. By reorganizing sales and marketing to compete in today&#39;s digital-first, omni-channel environment, you gain newfound talent and knowledge from the resources already at hand. This book provides two pragmatic frameworks for implementing and customizing a new marketing operating system at any size organization, with step-by-step roadmaps for optimizing your customer experience to gain a competitive advantage.

Customizable for any industry, sector, or scale, these frameworks can help your organization leap to the front of the line. &lt;p&gt;The evolution of marketing and sales demands a revolution in business strategy, but realizing the irrelevance of traditional methods doesn&#39;t necessarily mean knowing what comes next. This book shows you how to compete in today&#39;s market, with real-world frameworks for implementation. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Optimize competitive advantage and customer experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Map strategy back to business objectives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Engage customers with a pragmatic, proven marketing system&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reorganize sales and marketing to fill talent and knowledge gaps&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s customer is savvy, with more options than ever before. It&#39;s critical to meet them where they are, and engagement is the cornerstone of any cohesive, effective strategy. The technological revolution has opened many doors for marketing and sales, but the key is knowing what lies behind each one—what works for your competitor may not be right for you. &lt;i&gt;Digital Sense&lt;/i&gt; cuts through the crosstalk and confusion to give you a solid strategy for success." />
