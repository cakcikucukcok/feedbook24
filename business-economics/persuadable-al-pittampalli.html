  <title>Persuadable - Al Pittampalli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a leader, changing your mind has always been perceived as a weakness. Not anymore. In a world that&amp;#8217;s changing faster than ever, successful leaders realize that a genuine willingness to change their own minds is the ultimate competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on evidence from social science, history, politics, and more, business consultant Al Pittampalli reveals why confidence, consistency, and conviction, are increasingly becoming liabilities&amp;#8212;while humility, inconsistency, and radical open-mindedness are powerful leadership assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Persuadable,&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#8217;ll learn how Ray Dalio became the most successful hedge fund manager in the world by strategically curbing confidence. How Alan Mullaly saved Ford Motor Company, not by staying the course, but by continually changing course. How one Nobel Prize-winning scientist discovered the cause of ulcers by bravely doubting his own entrenched beliefs. You&amp;#8217;ll learn how Billy Graham&amp;#8217;s change of heart helped propel the civil rights movement, and how a young NFL linebacker&amp;#8217;s radical new position may prove to alter the world of professional football as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittampalli doesn&amp;#8217;t just explain why you should be persuadable. Distilling cutting edge research from cognitive and social psychology, he shows you precisely how. Rife with actionable advice, &lt;em&gt;Persuadable&lt;/em&gt; is an invaluable guide for today&amp;#8217;s data-driven, results-oriented leader.&lt;/p&gt;" />
