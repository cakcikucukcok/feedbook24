  <title>Summary: Building Strong Brands - David Aaker - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “BUILDING STRONG BRANDS: How the Best Brand Managers Build Brand Equity” by David Aaker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Aaker is Vice-Chairman of Prophet Brand Strategy, a strategic professional services firm, and a Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business, University of California. He is widely acknowledged as the preeminent authority on brand equity and brand strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Building Strong Brands, he argues that a strong brand creates customer interest and loyalty, and can be an organization’s most valuable strategic asset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brand equity is historical – the current brand image is derived from actions previously taken. The process of adding value to a brand so that it has greater equity in the future is termed a brand identity program. Through the integration of additional product attributes, organizational attributes, personality characteristics and visual imagery, including symbols, the brand identity program adds value to the brand in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In essence, since a strong brand is the strategic asset which holds the key to the long-term performance of any organization, any initiative focused on building the value of the brand is integral to the long-term viability of the organization itself. Buiding Strong Brands is therefore a very useful book for your organization." />
