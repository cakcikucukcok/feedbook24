  <title>Summary: Investing Without A Silver Spoon - Jeff Fischer - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “INVESTING WITHOUT A SILVER SPOON: How Anyone Can Build Wealth Through Direct Investing” by Jeff Fischer.&lt;br&gt;Jeff Fischer puts forward a case for sensible investing that yields a long-term return without massive capital at the start. Direct investment plans allow a person to build wealth slowly and steadily by investing in companies at whatever rate they can afford on a regular basis without using (or paying) a broker. By then reinvesting the dividends that are earned through buying more stock, compound growth occurs over the longer term. &lt;br&gt;‘‘Conventional wisdom, Fischer suggests, holds that you need a pile of cash larger than Jabba the Hutt before you begin to successfully invest in stocks. Investing via direct investment plans turns that notion on its head and proves the opposite can be true. Whether you have $100 or $100,000, what’s most meaningful is when you start to invest and how you invest.’’&lt;br&gt;He explains that direct investors can take positive control of their own financial futures. Investing Without a Silver Spoon takes the prospective investor through the financial jargon, what you need to begin, and how to invest for the long-term, not short-term. He acknowledges that Direct Investment isn’t for everyone – if you have a high interest debt, for example – but believes that good research combined with intelligent decision-making can yield financial freedom and a worry-free retirement.&lt;br&gt;" />
