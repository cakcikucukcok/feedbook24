  <title>Win or Die - Bruce Craven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;When it comes to the most-anticipated business books of 2019, &lt;i&gt;Win or Die: Leadership Secrets From Game of Thrones &lt;/i&gt;is the one to beat.&quot;--Inc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A guide to leading without losing your head, inspired by the bestselling books and smash television series &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&quot;When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.&quot; --Cersei Lannister&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the great joys of &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; is strategizing what bold moves you&#39;d make in this bloody, volatile world--from the comfort of your living room. And one of the great terrors of being a leader is knowing your real world can be just as brutal--and offices bring no comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every day you&#39;re presented with opportunities and challenges, and must decide which roads to follow, which risks to confront, when to deny an opportunity and when to pursue the call to adventure. And you won&#39;t know whether you&#39;ll profit or fail while you&#39;re in the thick of it. In &lt;i&gt;Win or Die:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Leadership Secrets from Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt;, Bruce Craven brilliantly analyzes the journeys of the best and worst leaders in Westeros, so that leaders can create their own narratives of success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craven considers beloved characters such as Ned Stark, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister as they make terrible decisions and fatal mistakes, but also achieve incredible victories and surprising successes, learning and growing along their (often bloody) ways. Readers will learn how to face conflict and build resilience, develop contextual and emotional intelligence, develop their vision, and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This entertaining and accessible guide will show readers how to turn danger into opportunity, even when dragons threaten.&lt;/p&gt;" />
