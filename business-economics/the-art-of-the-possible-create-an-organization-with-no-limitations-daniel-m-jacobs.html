  <title>The Art of the Possible: Create an Organization With No Limitations - Daniel M. Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Art of the Possible Create an Organization with No Limitations offers instructive insight into what works in business, revealing how a few simple tenets can build long-standing excellence and success. An easy-to-use integrated leadership and management guide, this book revolves around the fact that strong, effective leadership is a requirement for any company hoping to become&amp;mdash;or remain&amp;mdash;relevant and competitive in the twenty-first century&amp;#39;s fast-paced business environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author Daniel M. Jacobs is one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading authorities on public contracting, a position that comes with a considerable wealth of knowledge. In The Art of the Possible, he distills decades of front-line experience from the corporate world into seven chapters. Each explores one of seven practical and proven best practices: get focused, surround yourself with talent, think strategically, forge a high-performance team, manage the fundamentals, maintain discipline, and communicate. Packed with useful guidelines, checklists, and self-assessment tools, the primary objective of this straightforward book is to move the reader to action and to create an organization where things get done. Jacobs includes plenty of real-world examples and success stories, and his determined focus on the positive underscores the importance of hard work and commitment to the improvement of management performance. His seven best practices can be applied across a broad spectrum of businesses, from private industry and government agencies to non-profits and civic organizations, making The Art of the Possible: Create an Organization with No Limitations an indispensable resource for today&amp;#39;s developing leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hailed by business leaders as &amp;quot;the kind of book that you really use to solve real problems and achieve real and lasting success&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a relentless course for success using a step-by-step, straightforward, no-nonsense approach for the creation of an organization with no limits,&amp;quot; this concise how-to is a must-read for anyone facing the unique challenges of today&amp;#39;s economy." />
