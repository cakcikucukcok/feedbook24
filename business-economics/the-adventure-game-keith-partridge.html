  <title>The Adventure Game - Keith Partridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Keith Partridge has been one of the world&#39;s leading adventure cameramen for two decades. The BAFTA winning Touching The Void, Beckoning Silence and Human Planet are just some of the films that have taken him to the ends of the earth. If some astonishing location has amazed you on television, or you have watched a climber, or explorer, in some outrageous position, the chances are that Keith Partridge was there with his camera. From the caves of Papua New Guinea to the summit of Mount Everest, no location has been too dangerous, no environment too wild, for his daring and consummate artistry. In this lavishly illustrated and beautifully designed volume Keith Partridge tells his story, describes the challenges and discusses the daring adventurers he has shared with personalities such as Steve Backshall, Joe Simpson, and Stephen Venables." />
