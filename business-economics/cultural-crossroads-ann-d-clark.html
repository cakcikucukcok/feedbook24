  <title>Cultural Crossroads - Ann D. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wake up. Go to work. Prepare for war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A tyrannical and irrational boss, job insecurity, unreasonable demands, stress from juggling home and familythese are just a few of the all-too-common grievances in the workplace today. Employees often live with resentment, frustration, and feelings of impending doom. They may not know what will happen next and lack a sense of control in their work lives. No wonder a workplace characterized by unanswered complaints is reminiscent of a combat zone.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Workplace Warfare&lt;/i&gt; discusses the high costs of stress and anger in the workplace. Written in a conversational style from the employee perspective, this practical guide goes beyond merely showing you how to make the best of a bad situation: its focus is on empowering you to understand the different kinds of situations you might face and to &lt;i&gt;take control&lt;/i&gt; of your own responses to frustrating situations, especially when dealing with bosses.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to redesign your job to get what you want from work every day. Based on actual case histories, providing professional psychological and employment advice, &lt;i&gt;Workplace Warfare&lt;/i&gt; offers readers higher levels of comfort and productivity on the job." />
