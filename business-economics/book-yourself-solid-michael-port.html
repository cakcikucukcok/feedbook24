  <title>Book Yourself Solid - Michael Port</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Kick off the cycle of success with serious self-promotion that works&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book Yourself Solid&lt;/i&gt; is a handbook for self-promotion that translates into results. We tend to think of &quot;busy&quot; as the equivalent of &quot;successful&quot;—but that&#39;s not always the case. The key lies in &lt;i&gt;what you&#39;re busy doing&lt;/i&gt;. Success means spending your time doing work that gets you closer to your goals, and the critical driving force behind that success is self-promotion. This book shows you how to promote more than just your skills—you need to sell your reputation, your service, your very self. It starts with laying a foundation so potential clients know you can give them what they want and need. How do people see you, and how does that diverge from what you would &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; them to think? Once you know where you are, you can map out a plan for getting where you need to be, and this book shows you how to build the reputation you need to be the go-to person in your field—and keep the business coming in long-term. &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book Yourself Solid has been one of the most popular marketing books in the world for service-based businesses since its initial release in 2006.&lt;/i&gt; This new third edition includes updated and expanded strategies, techniques, and skills to help you get more clients and increase your take-home profits. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build a solid foundation for a stellar public image&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enhance your reputation for trust and credibility&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Perfect your pitch and pricing to attract higher-caliber clients&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adopt the six core strategies that will keep you booked solid&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spending just a small amount of time on self-promotion is an investment. You build a reputation that attracts high-quality clients, which boosts your profits, your track record, and your reputation, which in turn attracts even more high-quality clients. &lt;i&gt;Book Yourself Solid&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to kick off this cycle of success, and maintain it for the long term." />
