  <title>Where did my industry go? - Mark Burgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My first experience of an agency was back in the mid 1990s. Since then I have set up and built various successful businesses in the property, marketing, recruitment, publishing and digital sectors. Over all those years I have always remained connected to the estate agency industry in one way or another but the crazy thing is that although my journey over the last 25+ years has been one of discovery and development, the estate agency industry itself has remained largely unchanged. I can still relate with all of the issues and processes that take place on a day-to-day basis, as if feels like it was only yesterday that I worked in estate agency myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The techniques and technology being used in the big wide world seem to have somehow passed traditional estate agency by and my Proptech company, Iceberg Digital, is on a mission to bring that tech, process and reasoning into estate agency and help traditional agents modernise their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book Mark breaks down some of the key issues that currently exist in most estate agency businesses and explains how those issues can not only be solved but also what needs to be done in order to reinvent your processes and how they will open your eyes to a whole new dawn in estate agency - one where your current competitors simply can&amp;rsquo;t compete.&lt;/p&gt;" />
