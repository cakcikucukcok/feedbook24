  <title>One Page Talent Management, with a New Introduction - Marc Effron, Miriam Ort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You know that winning in today&#39;s marketplace requires top-quality talent. You also know what it takes to build that talent--and you spend significant financial and human resources to make it happen. Yet somehow, your company&#39;s beautifully designed and well-benchmarked processes don&#39;t translate into the bottom-line talent depth you need. Why? Talent management experts Marc Effron and Miriam Ort argue that companies unwittingly add layers of complexity to their talent building models--without evaluating whether those components add any value to the overall process. Consequently, simple processes like setting employee performance goals become multi-page, headache-inducing time-wasters that turn managers off to the whole process and fail to improve results. In this revolutionary book, Effron and Ort introduce One Page Talent Management (OPTM): a powerfully simple approach that significantly accelerates a company&#39;s ability to develop better leaders faster. The authors outline a straightforward, easy-to-use process for designing results-oriented OPTM processes: base every process on proven scientific research; eliminate complexity by including only those components that add real value to the process; and build transparency and accountability into every practice. Based on extensive research and the authors&#39; hands-on corporate and consulting experience with companies including Avon Products, Bank of America, and Philips, &lt;i&gt;One Page Talent Management&lt;/i&gt; shows how to: Quickly identify high potential talent without complex assessments; increase the number of &quot;ready now&quot; successors for key roles; generate 360 feedback that accelerates change in the most critical behaviors; significantly reduce the time required for managers to implement talent processes; and enforce accountability for growing talent through corporate culture, compensation, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
