  <title>The Man and the Statesman: The Correspondence and Articles on Politics - Frederic Bastiat, Jacques de Guenin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Liberty Fund&#39;s new six-volume The Collected Works of Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Bastiat series, of which &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Man and the Statesman &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;is the first volume, may be considered the most complete edition of Bastiat&#39;s works published to date, in any country, and in any language. The main source for this translation is the seven-volume &lt;I&gt;Oeuvres compl&amp;egrave;tes de Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Bastiat&lt;/I&gt;, published in the 1850s and 1860s.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The present volume, most of which has never before been translated into English, includes Bastiat&#39;s complete correspondence: 207 letters Bastiat wrote between 1819, when he was only 18 years old, until just a few days before his untimely death in 1850 at the age of 49. For contemporary classical liberals, Bastiat&#39;s correspondence will provide a unique window into a long-forgotten world where opposition to war and colonialism went hand-in-hand with support for free trade and deregulation. Bastiat&#39;s numerous letters to Richard Cobden, a Member of Parliament and best known today as the leader of the British Anti-Corn Law League, chronicle the profound effect the Anti-Corn League had on Bastiat. The League&#39;s success in mobilizing a popular movement in England to pressure the British government into abolishing the very protectionist &amp;quot;corn laws,&amp;quot; in 1846, inspired Bastiat to emulate the League&#39;s success in France by starting his own free-trade movement.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Man and the Statesman &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;also includes articles and other writings on politics and current events that showcase Bastiat&#39;s talent as a theoretician, a pamphleteer, a journalist, and a deputy (Member of Parliament) of the nascent French Second Republic. Together with the correspondence, the writings in this volume fill an important gap in our understanding of the lesser-known Bastiat, who, in just a few short years, made a profound impact on French intellectual and political life in Paris. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forthcoming titles in The Collected Works of Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Bastiat series include:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&amp;quot;The Law,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The State,&amp;quot; and Other Political Writings, 1843-1850&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Economic Sophisms and &amp;quot;What is Seen and What is Not Seen&amp;quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Miscellaneous Works on Economics: From &amp;quot;Jacques-Bonhomme&amp;quot; to Le Journal des &lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;&amp;Eacute;conomistes&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Economic Harmonies&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Struggle Against Protectionism: The English and French Free-Trade Movements&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Bastiat &lt;/B&gt;(1801-1850) was born in the French port city of Bayonne and became one of the leading advocates of free markets and free trade in the mid-nineteenth century. A theorist of classical liberal political economy and an elected member of various French political bodies, he opposed both protectionism and the rise of socialist ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Jacques de Guenin&lt;/B&gt; is president of the Cercle Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Bastiat. He is a graduate of the &amp;Eacute;cole des Mines in Paris and holds a Master of Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Jean-Claude Paul-Dejean&lt;/B&gt; is a historian from the University of Bordeaux and a Bastiat scholar.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Dennis O&#39;Keeffe &lt;/B&gt;is Professor of Social Science at the University of Buckingham, Buckingham, England, and is Senior Research Fellow in Education at the Institute of Economic Affairs, London.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;David M.
