  <title>Building Bridges and Viaducts for Model Railways - Bob Alderman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Written by an acknowledged expert, this practical book is essential reading for all those railway modellers who wish to build a bridge or a viaduct for their layout. This new book contains in-depth descriptions and photographs of bridges located around Britain (and one in New Zealand), ranging from the small to the monumental, from which the modeller can gain ideas and draw inspiration. As an essential aid to modelling, the constituent parts of the bridges are described as well as the engineering principles that make them &#39;work&#39; and the materials from which they are built. Step-by-step instructions and photographs depict the construction in plasticard of five models: a simple girder bridge; a truss-girder bridge; a masonry arch bridge; a plate-girder bridge; and a viaduct. The book covers prototype research, taking measurements, modelling materials and tools, and examines the finishing process, including different ways of applying paint and weathering powders in order to make your model look authentic. Fully illustrated with over 500 colour photographs and diagrams.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
