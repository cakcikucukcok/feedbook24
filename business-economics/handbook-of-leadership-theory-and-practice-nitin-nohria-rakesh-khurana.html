  <title>Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice - Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Scores of books and articles have been written in the popular press and mainstream marketplace about leadership: who leaders are, what they do, and why they matter. Yet in academia, there is a dearth of rigorous research, journal articles, or doctoral programs focused on leadership as a discipline. Why do top business schools espouse mission statements that promise to &quot;educate the leaders of the future&quot;- yet fail to give leadership its intellectual due?&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice seeks to bridge this disconnect. Based on the Harvard Business School Centennial Colloquium &quot;Leadership: Advancing an Intellectual Discipline&quot; and edited by HBS professors Nitin Nohria and Rakesh Khurana, this volume brings together the most important scholars from fields as diverse as psychology, sociology, economics, and history to take stock of what we know about leadership and to set an agenda for future research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;More than a means of getting ahead and gaining power, leadership must be understood as a serious professional and personal responsibility. Featuring the thinking of today&#39;s most renowned scholars, the Handbook of Leadership Theory and Practice will be a catalyst for elevating leadership to a higher intellectual plane - and help shape the research agenda for the next generation of leadership scholars.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
