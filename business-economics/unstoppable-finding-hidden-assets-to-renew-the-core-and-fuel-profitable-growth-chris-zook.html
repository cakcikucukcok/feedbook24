  <title>Unstoppable: Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth - Chris Zook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Over the next decade, two out of every three companies will face the challenge of their corporate lives: redefining their core business. Buffeted by global competition and facing an uncertain future, more and more executives will realize that they must make fundamental changes in their core even as they continue delivering the goods and services that keep them in business today.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/EM&gt; shows these managers how to look deep within their organizations to find undervalued, unrecognized, or underutilized assets that can serve as new platforms for sustainable growth. Drawing on more than thirty interviews with CEOs from companies such as De Beers, American Express, and Samsung, it shows readers how to recognize when the core needs reinvention and how to deploy the &quot;hidden assets&quot; that can be the basis for tomorrow&#39;s growth. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Building on the author&#39;s previous books, &lt;EM&gt;Profit from the Core&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Beyond the Core&lt;/EM&gt;, this book shows how any company in crisis can transform itself to become truly unstoppable.  &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
