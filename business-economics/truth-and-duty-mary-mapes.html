  <title>Truth and Duty - Mary Mapes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A riveting account of how the public&#39;s right to know is being attacked by an unholy alliance among politicians, news organizations and corporate America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For twenty five years, Mary Mapes has been an award-winning television producer and reporter -- the last fifteen of them for CBS News, principally for the &lt;i&gt;CBS Evening News with Dan Rather&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/i&gt;. She had the bedrock of respect of her peers -- in 2003 alone, she broke the story of the Abu Ghraib prison tortures (which won CBS The Peabody Award) and the existence of Strom Thurmond&#39;s illegitimate bi-racial daughter Essie Mae Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was Dan Rather&#39;s lightning rod of a story on George W. Bush&#39;s National Guard Service that brought Mapes into an unwanted limelight. The firestorm that followed the broadcast led not only to Mapes&#39; firing and Rather&#39;s stepping down from his anchor chair a year early, but to an unprecedented &quot;internal&quot; inquiry into the story -- chaired by former Reagan Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peopled with an historic and colorful cast of characters--from Karl Rove to Summer Redstone to John Kerry to Col. Bobby Hodges -- this groundbreaking book about how the television news is made (and unmade) made headlines itself when first published. But this, it turns out, is only part of the story. Mapes talks for the first time about the riveting behind-the-scenes action at CBS during this frenzied period and exposes some of the largest political and social controversies that have broken in this new age of dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Truth and Duty&lt;/i&gt; was made into the 2015 film Truth, starring Cate Blanchett, Robert Redford, Topher Grace and Elizabeth Moss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
