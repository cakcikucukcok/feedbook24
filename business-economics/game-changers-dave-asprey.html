  <title>Game Changers - Dave Asprey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Head Strong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Bulletproof Diet&lt;/em&gt; answers the question, &amp;#8220;How can I kick more ass at life?&amp;#8221; by culling the wisdom of world-class thought leaders, maverick scientists, and disruptive entrepreneurs to provide proven techniques for becoming happier, healthier, and smarter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dave Asprey started his &lt;em&gt;Bulletproof Radio&lt;/em&gt; podcast more than five years ago, he sought out influencers in an array of disciplines, from biochemists toiling in unknown laboratories to business leaders changing the world to mediation masters discovering inner peace. His guests were some of the top performing humans in the world, people who had changed their areas of study or even pioneered entirely new fields. Dave wanted to know: What did they have in common? What mattered most to them? What made them so successful&amp;#8212;and what made them tick? At the end of each interview, Dave asked the same question: &amp;#8220;What are your top three recommendations for people who want to perform better at being human?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After performing a statistical analysis of the answers, he found that the wisdom gleaned from these highly successful people could be distilled into three main objectives: finding ways to become smarter, faster, and happier. &lt;em&gt;Game Changers&lt;/em&gt; is the culmination of Dave&amp;#8217;s years-long immersion in these conversations, offering 46 science-backed, high performance &amp;#8220;laws&amp;#8221; that are a virtual playbook for how to get better at life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With anecdotes from game changers like Dr. Daniel Amen, Gabby Bernstein, Dr. David Perlmutter, Arianna Huffington, Esther Perel, and Tim Ferris&amp;#160;as well as examples from Dave&amp;#8217;s own life, &lt;em&gt;Game Changers&lt;/em&gt; offers readers practical advice they can put into action to reap immediate rewards. From taming fear and anxiety to making better decisions, establishing high-performance habits, and practicing gratitude and mindfulness, Dave brings together the wisdom of today&amp;#8217;s game-changers to help everyone kick more ass at life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
