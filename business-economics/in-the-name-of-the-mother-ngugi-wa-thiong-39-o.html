  <title>In the Name of the Mother - Ngugi wa Thiong&#39;o</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Renowned worldwide, as novelist and dramatist, Ngugi wa Thiongo&#39;s contributions to the body of critical writing on African literature, politics and society have been highly significant. His best knowncritical work is Decolonising the Mind, which since publication in 1986 has profoundly influenced other writers, critics, scholars and students. These latest essays reflect Ngugi&#39;s continuing interests and enthusiasms. His choice of writers is original. He makes us look again at their novels to address his lifelong concerns with the ways to independence, the meanings of colonialism and the takeover by neo-colonialism, and the functions of literature in political as well as literary terms. They will appeal not only to his international band of supporters. They will also introduce his views to young people discovering African and Caribbean literature. Ngugi wa Thiong&#39;o is Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Irvine. Ngugi is renowned for his essays, including the seminal Decolonising the Mind (James Currey 1986); his plays, which led to his detention in Kenya; his novels - the most recent works being The Wizard of the Crow (2007, translated into English from Gikuyu) and his memoirs Dreams in a Time of War and In the House of the Interpreter East Africa [Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda]: EAEP" />
