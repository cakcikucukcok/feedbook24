  <title>Lifestorming - Alan Weiss, Marshall Goldsmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Revamp your life to grow, evolve, and become who you want to be&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lifestorming&lt;/i&gt; is the indispensably practical handbook for becoming the person you want to be. Redesign your life, friends, behaviors, and beliefs to move closer to your goals every single day, guided by expert insight and deep introspection. Written by a veteran author team behind almost 100 books on human behavior, this guide helps you learn why you do things the way you do them, and how to do them &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;. The Lifestorming Test allows you to assess your current state in concrete terms, and assess your ability to change and adapt — from there, it&#39;s about identifying people, actions, habits, and beliefs that either support your personal and professional growth or hold you back. You&#39;ll learn the six building blocks of character, challenge your belief system, develop a leadership mindset, and overcome the fear and guilt of success. You&#39;ll map out an action plan, and learn how to continually move forward at work, at home, and in everyday life. &lt;p&gt;We often don&#39;t realize how much of our natural default is established by others. Whose goals are you working toward? Are you measuring your progress with the correct yardstick? This book shows you how to take a step back and compare your life today with the future you want — and build a plan for changing track toward constant evolution and growth. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Assess your current state and your capacity for change&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop the right goals and the right metrics to create the future you want&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how character evolves, and why it&#39;s essential to growth&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Change your habits and behaviors to consistently grow and evolve&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all carry around old baggage, obsolete &quot;friendships&quot;, and counterproductive beliefs — and every day, they pull us a little further away from what we really want. &lt;i&gt;Lifestorming&lt;/i&gt; is your real-world guide to shedding the stagnation, and allowing yourself to grow into the person you want to become." />
