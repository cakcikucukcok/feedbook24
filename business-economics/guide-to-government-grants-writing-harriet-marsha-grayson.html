  <title>Guide to Government Grants Writing - Harriet Marsha Grayson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The government has literally billions of dollars to give away. While many people express interest in applying for government grants they falsely think the process is too complicated. &lt;I&gt;The Guide to Government Grants Writing&lt;/I&gt; simplifies this process. In addition, information is provided on bidding for government contracts, which are available to organizations of all types as well as individuals.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Guide to Government Grants Writing&lt;/I&gt; is a concise, simple but elegant tool designed to assist any individual or organization, including non-profit and for-profit businesses on researching and writing government grant applications. The Guide illustrates and provides specific step-by-step examples on how to complete the seemingly dense application as well as forms required of all government grant applications. The Guide is a basic reference tool for accessing grants information on all government levels-federal, state and local. Specific state-by-state details are provided on grants available in all 50 states.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Don&#39;t let the forms and the length of the application announcement prevent you or your organization from applying for government grants and or seeking government contracts. &lt;I&gt;The Guide to Government Grants Writing&lt;/I&gt; makes the entire process manageable. Don&#39;t let your organization miss out on the opportunities.&lt;/P&gt;" />
