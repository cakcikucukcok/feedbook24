  <title>Start a Shopify Business - Edgard Joel Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Start a Shopify Business With Absolutely No Experience!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As an entrepreneur, we all know how hard it is to begin your career. That is why I find solutions to your problems as you are starting out. Since we all need easier ways to start a business, this ebbok will talk about Shopify, as it is very powerful and easy to use. Investors and small business owners alike are attracted to the Shopify platform as it makes their lives a whole lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;
To get more people on board and engaged with Shopify, they hold a contest every year and give the winner a cash prize. Sometimes it can be about $100,000. Remember there are many ways to get your customers engaged, and holding a contest is one of them. So that is what Shopify does to up the excitement of starting a business and you can hold contests for your customers too.&lt;br /&gt;
Since the beginning of time when more than one household began using the Internet, there have been shopping platforms for business people to use to exchange goods for money. Shopify is one of the earliest known platforms beginning in 2004 and is a major solution in the market today. It is an easy way to build trust and get people to buy from you." />
