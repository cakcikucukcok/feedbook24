Healthy personnel &lt;br&gt;
Sound management &lt;br&gt;

Effective communication &lt;br&gt;
Appropriate Policies and procedures &lt;br&gt;
Successful Products &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Akay explains what is considered ethical and proper etiquette and what is not, and how to apply these concepts to the six components in order to create a humanized corporation. To better explain and communicate these crucial topics, Akay uses several personal experiences from his twenty-four-year professional career.
