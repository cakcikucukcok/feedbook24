  <title>Buying Time - Jeff Gorton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buying Time&lt;/em&gt; is a clear guide for successfully funding the retirement years, written by financial planner Jeff Gorton. As a specialist in retirement planning, over many years he has helped hundreds of people deploy their assets strategically&amp;mdash;so they will last throughout the decades of retirement at the desired income level&amp;mdash;while also funding the realization of lifelong goals and dreams. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finances often weigh on a person&amp;rsquo;s mind, especially when retirement is approaching. They wonder if they have saved enough, invested wisely and have the right plan in place to take care of them throughout retirement. These questions can become burdensome, and the answers are not always easily found when looking on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his guidebook reveals, Gorton bases the financial strategies he designs for individual clients on a logical process in order to develop a written plan, which is the best possible antidote to an all-too-common, pre-retirement stance of simply &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;hoping for the best.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;In doing so, Gorton shows not how to hope for the best, but how to &lt;em&gt;plan for the best&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;and achieve a secure and fulfilling retirement. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
