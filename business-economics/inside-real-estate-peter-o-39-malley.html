  <title>Inside Real Estate - Peter O&#39;Malley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The real world of modern real estate exposed&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inside Real Estate&lt;/i&gt; is a down-to-earth consumer guide for anyone navigating the property market in the digital age. Written by industry veteran Peter O&#39;Malley, this book exposes the truth about modern real estate and shows you how to work the market to optimize your financial benefit. Forget what you&#39;ve seen or heard — the media&#39;s hype surrounding real estate doesn&#39;t accurately reflect the reality on the ground. With the rise of digital platforms, foreign buyers and property booms and busts, the agent&#39;s role is changing amidst a rapidly evolving field; media spin benefits agents more than consumers, but this book offers step-by-step guidance on silencing the noise and working with reality. &lt;p&gt;Exposing common practices and blowing myths wide open, this book shows you what the property market is &lt;i&gt;today&lt;/i&gt; — and how to take advantage of it to buy, sell or invest in &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; best financial interest. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cut through the hype and learn the truth behind the myths&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Understand the agent&#39;s new and changing role in a disrupted industry&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn the tips, traps and tactics that could sink or save your investment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Deal with rising and falling markets as a buyer or seller&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The industry&#39;s digital disruption is not going away, and certain aspects of the market have been permanently changed as a result. The good news is that property is still a smart financial move, and it is possible to come out ahead regardless of the market&#39;s behaviour — but first you need to separate spin from reality. &lt;i&gt;Inside Real Estate&lt;/i&gt; takes you behind the curtain to help you navigate the market with clear eyes and a solid understanding of the real-world market." />
