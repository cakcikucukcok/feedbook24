  <title>Your Prosperous Mind - Aaron Anastasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have a prosperous mind. But for many of us, it remains idle. This book reveals how to tap into it, develop it, and use it to create unprecedented results&amp;mdash;even in the midst of the chaos, insecurity, and uncertainty of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you will find in this book:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; How to get unstuck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; How to radically multiply your impact overnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; The four most common pitfalls keeping you from success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; How maintaining discipline is easier than you think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; How to implement and leverage the power of habits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; How to strengthen your relationships with one simple practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; How to make your life work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of us, not knowing whether the next endeavor, project, or opportunity is going to work out can be scary or even debilitating. This book gives you the tools necessary to be successful amidst the scarcity of time, lack of attention, and information saturation of everyday life. It will help you access and strengthen your uniquely Prosperous Minds and allow you to thrive in a fast-paced world, as we pursue the voices that call us to our most heroic selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many books in the self-help genre, Your Prosperous Mind (YPM) isn&amp;rsquo;t trying to get readers a more prosperous mind and life; Anastasi acknowledges that we already have all we need to succeed. The main message to readers is that you are not deficient. The goal is to facilitate a few small shifts in your thinking that will help you come from a different place. Because success is less about doing something different, and more about choosing a different way of being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book assumes that you already have a prosperous mind, because you do. Now, whether you&amp;rsquo;re currently accessing it to the degree that you want is a different story. Readers would not pick up this book if they were all maxed out on your potential prosperity (financially, relationally, altruistically, creatively, and otherwise). The primary goal of this book is to give readers the keys to unlock your Prosperous Minds and get new results in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principles, strategies, and steps in this book can be used to accomplish extraordinary results; whether you are stuck in life or already crushing it and ready for the next big challenge. This book will show readers how to see and take hold of options and opportunities that most people won&amp;rsquo;t, and don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;" />
