  <title>How to Think Like an  Ebay Powerseller - Brad Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="eBay isn&#39;t just an auction and a marketplace: often it can feel quite a lot like a game. Like any game, you can get ahead if you think strategically, using your head to outwit the other buyers and get the best price. Here are a few things you can try. Shop in the Summer. This is simple, but effective. Summer is the quiet season on eBay - almost everything sells for less. While everyone else is out enjoying the sun, invest a little time to find some real bargains. Beat Them by a Few Cents. Outbid people by a few cents instead of a few dollars - if they don&#39;t check back before the auction ends, then you will be the winner. To avoid people using this tactic on you, though, always bid strange, hard-to-guess amounts instead of round numbers." />
