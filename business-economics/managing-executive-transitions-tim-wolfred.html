  <title>Managing Executive Transitions - Tim Wolfred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Essential Guide for Managing Leadership Turnovers A leadership transition can be a time of high vulnerability for a nonprofit organization. On the other hand, an executive turnover offers unique opportunities for renewal and fresh thinking. Managing Executive Transitions shows how this state of transition can give board and staff members a chance to put things back together in new and creative ways&amp;#151;to discard some old pieces and to bring in fresh elements. Nonprofit boards and executive directors will find practical advice on how to manage leadership turnovers in ways that can heighten mission impact while avoiding potential downsides. Author Tim Wolfred recommends a transformational process of three phases: Prepare, Pivot, and Thrive. In the Prepare phase board members, staff, volunteers, and funders engage in an efficient process for updating the agency&#39;s strategic directions and crafting a profile of the skills needed in the next executive. In the Pivot phase a search ensues, conducted by a board reinvigorated and excited about the agency&#39;s future impact. In the Thrive phase the board engages the newly hired executive as a leadership partner and gives him or her clear performance priorities derived from the strategic directions. Engaging case studies and hands-on tools such as planning agendas, timelines, sample letters, and communication tips will smooth the transition to new executive leadership.&lt;/div&gt;" />
