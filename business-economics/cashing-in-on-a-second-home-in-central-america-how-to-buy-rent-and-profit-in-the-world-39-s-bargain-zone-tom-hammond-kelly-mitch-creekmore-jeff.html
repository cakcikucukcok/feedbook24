  <title>Cashing In On a Second Home in Central America: How to Buy, Rent and Profit in the World&#39;s Bargain Zone - Tom Hammond Kelly, Mitch Creekmore, Jeff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In their newly updated book Cashing In on a Second Home in Mexico - How to Buy, Rent and Profit from Property South of the Border, authors Tom Kelly and Mitch Creekmore guide readers on topics like safely holding property in Mexico&amp;#39;s restricted zone, how to research property for purchase, and navigating the nuances of the Mexican closing process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This book clarifies and explains why Mexican real estate, when using proper safeguards, can be a terrific, secure investment,&amp;quot; said Creekmore, who has&lt;br&gt;spent the past 15 years working to provide title insurance policies for&lt;br&gt;Americans and Canadians in Mexico. &amp;quot;It will also explore the purchasing&lt;br&gt;mistakes of the past, summarize several of the attractive new locations that&lt;br&gt;are luring foreign dollars and explain why Mexico is so eager to welcome&lt;br&gt;second home buyers from outside its borders.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst thing a potential purchaser can do is to remain ignorant of the&lt;br&gt;law and procedures involved in the conveyance of real estate in a foreign&lt;br&gt;country. As we state several times in this book, Mexico is not the perceived&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Wild West&amp;quot; where anything goes and the prevailing Mexican attitude is&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;trust me, no problema.&amp;quot; It is inherently important for non-Mexican buyers&lt;br&gt;to understand that Mexico has formality of law with authorized regulation of&lt;br&gt;real estate development procedures at all levels. This process is coupled&lt;br&gt;with a statutory government framework for the legal conveyance of real&lt;br&gt;property.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great personal wealth has been attained through real estate ownership, but&lt;br&gt;for most of us, it has been limited to investment in a primary residence.&lt;br&gt;Although Mexican real estate also can be a viable investment venue,&lt;br&gt;Americans have had a great deal more trepidation considering properties&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;south of the border.&amp;quot; And for good reason-considering the history of some&lt;br&gt;acquisitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given today&amp;#39;s investment climate, however, Mexico provides an attractive,&lt;br&gt;alternative arena for potential investment. Real estate in Mexico should&lt;br&gt;have a similar appreciation &amp;quot;upside&amp;quot; as does real estate in a U.S.&lt;br&gt;development-coupled with the advantage of use and enjoyment of the property&lt;br&gt;as a vacation residence. This book clarifies what&amp;#39;s possible." />
