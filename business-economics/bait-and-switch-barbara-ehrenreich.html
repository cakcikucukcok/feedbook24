  <title>Bait and Switch - Barbara Ehrenreich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bestselling author of Nickel and Dimed goes back undercover to do for America&#39;s ailing middle class what she did for the working poor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara Ehrenreich&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;/i&gt; explored the lives of low-wage workers. Now, in Bait and Switch, she enters another hidden realm of the economy: the shadowy world of the white-collar unemployed. Armed with a plausible résumé of a professional &quot;in transition,&quot; she attempts to land a middle-class job--undergoing career coaching and personality testing, then trawling a series of EST-like boot camps, job fairs, networking events, and evangelical job-search ministries. She gets an image makeover, works to project a winning attitude, yet is proselytized, scammed, lectured, and--again and again--rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bait and Switch&lt;/i&gt; highlights the people who&#39;ve done everything right--gotten college degrees, developed marketable skills, and built up impressive résumés--yet have become repeatedly vulnerable to financial disaster, and not simply due to the vagaries of the business cycle. Today&#39;s ultra-lean corporations take pride in shedding their &quot;surplus&quot; employees--plunging them, for months or years at a stretch, into the twilight zone of white-collar unemployment, where job searching becomes a full-time job in itself. As Ehrenreich discovers, there are few social supports for these newly disposable workers--and little security even for those who have jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the now classic &lt;i&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bait and Switch&lt;/i&gt; is alternately hilarious and tragic, a searing exposé of economic cruelty where we least expect it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
