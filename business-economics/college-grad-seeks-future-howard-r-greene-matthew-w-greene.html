  <title>College Grad Seeks Future - Howard R. Greene, Matthew W. Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the coming year, college graduates will have a more difficult time than ever entering the job market. Opportunities in traditional fields are shrinking as the competition increases exponentially. Despite this glaring truth, far too many post-collegians automatically consider the most visible, traditional careers - usually out of confusion, uncertainty, and peer and parental pressures. Fields like law, medicine, and banking (just to name a few) are often overpopulated, and thus extremely competitive for entry level positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In COLLEGE GRAD SEEKS FUTURE, Howard and Matthew Greene will help post-collegians to find their true calling, pursue the field that best fits their talents and passion, and utilize their unique skills to build a career efficiently and effectively. The Greenes explain to readers the highly individualistic nature of choosing a career, the interesting choices that are frequently overlooked, and the imaginative ways in which young adults can identify their goals and take the necessary steps to realize them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
