  <title>Blogging for Profits: How to Set Up and Run a Successful Blog for Profit - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A blog can make you money, build a relationship with your subscribers and generate traffic to your website. Yes, everyone&#39;s talking about Facebook, Twitter and Google+ - and on the surface of it blogging may today appear a little &#39;old hat&#39; - but that doesn&#39;t mean you should leave blogging on the table.   Not only is blogging good for business, it is fun too and can help you to build relationships with other marketers. This could lead to JV deals and collaborations etc. - and it&#39;s an added bonus of blogging that often gets overlooked.   Take a look at the top internet marketers. They pretty much ALL have a blog don&#39;t they?  There&#39;s also niche blogging - and it&#39;s certainly a very valid way of making money online, especially if you can build up a large portfolio of blogs in different niches." />
