  <title>The Bullseye Principle - David Lewis, G. Riley Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critical communication lessons for sustained corporate success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bullseye Principle&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive how-to guide for communicating, collaborating, and executing as a leader in the corporate arena. With these “soft skills” trending above technical knowledge in executive wish lists, this book provides invaluable guidance for new and experienced leaders alike; from the planning stages to the outcome and beyond, the discussion features critical insight and actionable tips based on award-winning methods. Polish your presence, utilize intention, influence emotion, engage workers, build relationships, make connections, and leverage the power of storytelling—it all comes down to technique. This book shows you everything you need to know to start communicating more effectively, starting today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The success of any communication rests more on &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; the information is conveyed than what that information actually is; at every level, in every sphere, effective leaders strive to master key skills that inspire, empower, motivate, and more. This book gives you a solid blueprint for effective communication in nearly any situation, merging the practical and theoretical to help you:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Master the most challenging business interactions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Become more influential as a leader and communicator&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adopt a 3-step methodology to collaborate more effectively&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build your personal brand and executive presence toward sustained success&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people believe that their communications skills are satisfactory for their jobs—most managers would disagree. That gap in perception presents a problem that ripples beyond your chances of promotion—where your communication fails, it has the capacity to affect the organization as a whole. &lt;i&gt;The Bullseye Principle&lt;/i&gt; helps you build a robust repertoire of communication skills that put you ahead of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;" />
