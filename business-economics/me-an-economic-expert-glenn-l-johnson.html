  <title>Me? an Economic Expert? - Glenn L. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you could change the world-would you do it?
It boggles the mind just to imagine the possibilities, doesnt it?  The idea is laced with questions about your goals, ambitions, beliefs and moral values.  
Economics is like that too.  Everything you do or dont do has an economic consequence that impacts you personally.  And everything the Government does impacts you as well.  In fact, our economic system is structured so the government benefits at your expense without doing anything at all.
I know economics sounds boring.  The way it was taught to me was boring.  I have discovered that it isnt about what we are taught and it isnt very difficult to understand.
Understanding some basic truths about economics will empower you to live a more enjoyable life.  These truths dont care how old or young you are.  They dont care whether you believe in God or not.  And they dont care who you voted for the last time or who you might vote for the next time.
Even if you cant change the world today, you do have the power to change your life and you can start right now." />
