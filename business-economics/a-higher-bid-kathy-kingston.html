  <title>A Higher Bid - Kathy Kingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Transform fundraising events into long-term revenue with expert auction advice&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Higher Bid&lt;/i&gt; is the nonprofit school and organization guide to planning and executing more exciting, more lucrative special event fundraisers. In this book, award-winning consultant, fundraiser, speaker, and professional auctioneer Kathy Kingston shares her proprietary and proven approaches to audience development, board empowerment, leadership succession, guest cultivation and engagement, and donor development. You&#39;ll learn how live auctions, special appeals, innovative icebreakers, silent auctions, and new technologies can help increase revenue, and how to execute these events in a way that translates to a stronger donor base for long-term giving. Kingston describes how to match the guest list and catalog for better results, and reveals the strategies professional auctioneers use to curate the right auction items and discover the right people to generate optimum revenue and engage donors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book offers a fresh approach to fundraising, showing you how charity benefit auctions can be made a centerpiece of fundraising special events to drive both short- and long-term fundraising goals while providing a fun and inspiring opportunity to generate awareness and keep supporters excited about the mission. Using Kingston&#39;s proven framework, you&#39;ll learn effective ways to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Strategically increase high-profit revenue streams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Increase your organization&#39;s donor base&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Empower the board toward efficiency and productivity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Engage supporters more deeply and keep them invested&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donors are the lifeblood of any nonprofit organization, and sustainable revenue depends upon their high engagement and willingness to give. Well-executed benefit and charity auctions have proven to be effective fundraisers for nonprofits, associations, and schools of all types, and &lt;i&gt;A Higher Bid&lt;/i&gt; is the expert guide to optimizing these special events for maximum impact.&lt;/p&gt;" />
