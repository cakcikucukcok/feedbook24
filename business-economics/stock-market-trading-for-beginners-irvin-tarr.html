  <title>Stock Market Trading for Beginners - Irvin Tarr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing
This bit of wisdom comes from the most successful investor the world has ever known  Warren Buffet (Otherwise known as, The oracle of Omaha)
This book was written to give the non-professional trader a better chance to be successful and save them the crippling cost of entering the market in a wild and undisciplined manner.  Above all, it can open the possibility for the readers to make gains beyond their wildest dreams.  
Whenever technical terms are first used in this book they are followed up by an explanation or definition of that term.   In this guide the author has avoided using abbreviations except when they are used frequently or have been repeated many times previously.
A dictionary of the more common technical words used in stock market Jargon can be found in the appendix. How to find all the others can also be found in the book.
Explanations are in plain English.
A dash of humor and fun is included. 
Dont ask why when there seems to be a bit of magic here and there." />
