  <title>Kiss (Keep It so Simple) Finances - Fred Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When reality set in and I realized that I had really lost - 3 businesses - 2 houses - my last commercial building  &amp;  about 10 million dollars  one of the things I knew I had to do is write a book to help everyone in the world to not make the same mistakes I had. The book had to help everyone from those who had already made millions to those who had buried themselves in a deep hole of debt. The book had to be easy to read with simple guidelines to follow and implement. I believe I have achieved that with &quot;KISS FINANCES&quot;.My only hope is that everyone who uses it will be truly blessed.
Bought his first company at 32. Built his first light industrial building for his company and to rent at 37 and went into his second business Commercial Real Estate. Started his third company in 1999, Contract Manufacturing for Electronics." />
