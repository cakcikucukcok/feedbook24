  <title>The End of Copycat China - Shaun Rein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;China&#39;s changing course, and sustainable success requires a shift in strategy&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The End of Copycat China&lt;/i&gt; helps business executives and investors understand how China&#39;s economy is shifting from one based on heavy investment to one on services and consumption by providing insight that help shape effective strategy. Drawing from over 50,000 interviews with entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, private equity investors, private Chinese companies, and multinationals, this book describes how Chinese firms are increasingly focused on innovation rather than copying what worked in America and how consumers are evolving with their hopes, dreams and aspirations. China&#39;s growth model of the last three decades is becoming increasingly ineffective, as relying on heavy investment and exports is becoming less and less feasible. Fifty percent of China&#39;s growth in 2013 stemmed from consumption, the government is establishing a Free Trade zone in Shanghai and ending the dominance of state-owned enterprises. This book provides a roadmap for companies and investors looking to navigate these changes and capture emerging trends, with deep insight and practical guidance on what innovation looks like in the new China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Survey the development of innovation taking place in China&#39;s economy, from an insider&#39;s perspective&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Consider the changes that must take place to shore up the broken growth model&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Examine the consumer trends emerging in the midst of rapid market evolution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Understand how China&#39;s rise will impact its neighbors like Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;China&#39;s dramatic shift toward consumption presents a tremendous opportunity for foreign business, but traditional tactics are outdated at best, financially fatal at worst, as local competitors focus on innovation and move up the value chain and as consumers look for new brands and categories to spend money on. New strategies are needed to keep pace with the changing regulatory and consumer environments, and &quot;business as usual&quot; won&#39;t get very far. &lt;i&gt;The End of Copycat China&lt;/i&gt; is the business guide to this emerging market, with expert guidance from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;" />
