  <title>Scarf Maven Ties One On - Terri Kane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gee, it must be fun to have a scarf business on V-Cart! Terri heard this for years from friends, family, and acquaintances, and now she has decided to tell you how much fun it really is to sell vintage scarves online and be known as Scarf Maven. Terri and her husband, Mike, run the company and often work long days (and nights) from their home, dubbed the Paisley Palace. Rewarding? Sure, but its also tedious and frustrating, especially when there is little separation between work and a personal life. 
But the truth is, yes! Its a lot of fun. Their lives havent always been charmed, but Terri and Mike manage to have a few laughs along the way. 
This humorous memoir follows Terris journey in the vintage scarf world of online selling, with glimpses at past endeavors that taught her all she knows about business, fashion, and life." />
