  <title>Decisions - Jim Treliving</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Co-owner of Boston Pizza and star of CBC-TV’s &lt;em&gt;Dragons’ Den&lt;/em&gt;, Jim Treliving reveals the secrets of his success, taking you behind the scenes at critical points in the building of his businesses—which also include Mr. Lube and interests in real estate and sports franchising. Covering the “big” decisions—from what to do with your life to how to source capital, find partners, handle change and inspire growth—Treliving sets out the tools for making effective choices and explains why every decision requires action. He also discusses how to bounce back from those no-so-good decisions, explaining how to refocus and recalibrate, just as Treliving had to do when he realized that Boston Pizza’s expansion into Asia was causing the company to drift off-brand. Pulling back from Asian opportunities was a tough decision at the time, but the move became crucial to guiding successful BP expansions later on. Always candid, Treliving also shares his insights on some very public choices, ones you may have seen him make on &lt;em&gt;The Big Decision&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dragons’ Den&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down to earth, sensible and filled with vision and humour, &lt;em&gt;Decisions&lt;/em&gt; is a book for budding entrepreneurs and for those who want the inside business stories beyond what we see on TV. But it’s also for people who want to transform their companies into ones that create steady wealth and lasting success. Even if you’re not in business, Treliving’s inspiring story and astute advice will help you make wiser decisions in your life and move forward with confidence in your chosen field.&lt;/p&gt;" />
