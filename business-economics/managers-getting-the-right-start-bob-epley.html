  <title>Managers—Getting the Right Start - Bob Epley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If youve been promoted to manage a business operation, life is about to get complicated. Some parts of the road ahead will be rocky and others smooth, and you can bet on some unexpected curves. Youll have to get used to adapting to change.
Bob Epley, an independent consultant and executive coach who served in numerous leadership positions with the Department of Veterans Affairs, tells new managers what to expect in this guide. He shares tips on implementing procedures, developing people, relating to individuals in other work groups, and monitoring progress. He also explores how management differs from leadership, noting, Managers should strive to be leaders. They need to understand that work will be done far more effectively if people take their instructions and requests willingly. If the workers do only as requested because they must, their performance will be average at best. Effective managers must know how to get started and how to identify the problems they face.
