  <title>Summary: Indispensable By Monday - Larry Miller - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “INDISPENSABLE BY MONDAY: Learn the Profit-Producing Behaviors That Will Help Your Company . . . And Yourself” by Larry Myler.&lt;br&gt;In today’s climate, it’s vital to make yourself indispensible at work. By making a big financial contribution to the company, and being able to quantify that contribution, you will make sure the firm still employs you in the long term. &lt;br&gt;Larry Myler explores some practical ways you can “pull money out of thin air”. Look at simple ways your company can cut money, for example, or access rebates and refund.  Have ideas for how to sell added-value products to existing customers and help recover lost ones. Know your company, and your competitors so well that you can find new ways to streamline processes. Work at your soft skills as well, because a lot of business is done and kept through good communication. Use your vacation time to meet prospects and suppliers. &lt;br&gt;Myler suggests that this doesn’t necessarily mean working a lot more hours, just that you plan your time better, so you work more effectively. By being a self-aware employee, you’ll build a better future for your company, and yourself. Indispensable By Monday sets out how to achieve that.&lt;br&gt;" />
