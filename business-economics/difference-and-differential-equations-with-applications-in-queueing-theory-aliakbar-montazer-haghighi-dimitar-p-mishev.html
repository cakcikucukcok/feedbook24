  <title>Difference and Differential Equations with Applications in Queueing Theory - Aliakbar Montazer Haghighi, Dimitar P. Mishev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Useful Guide to the Interrelated Areas of Differential Equations, Difference Equations, and Queueing Models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difference and Differential Equations with Applications in Queueing Theory&lt;/i&gt; presents the unique connections between the methods and applications of differential equations, difference equations, and Markovian queues. Featuring a comprehensive collection of topics that are used in stochastic processes, particularly in queueing theory, the book thoroughly discusses the relationship to systems of linear differential difference equations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book demonstrates the applicability that queueing theory has in a variety of fields including telecommunications, traffic engineering, computing, and the design of factories, shops, offices, and hospitals. Along with the needed prerequisite fundamentals in probability, statistics, and Laplace transform, &lt;i&gt;Difference and Differential Equations with Applications in Queueing Theory&lt;/i&gt; provides:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A discussion on splitting, delayed-service, and delayed feedback for single-server, multiple-server, parallel, and series queue models&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Applications in queue models whose solutions require differential difference equations and generating function methods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Exercises at the end of each chapter along with select answers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is an excellent resource for researchers and practitioners in applied mathematics, operations research, engineering, and industrial engineering, as well as a useful text for upper-undergraduate and graduate-level courses in applied mathematics, differential and difference equations, queueing theory, probability, and stochastic processes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
