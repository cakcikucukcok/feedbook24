  <title>Impatient Optimist: Bill Gates in His Own Words - Lisa Rogak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Bill Gates, the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, has been a revered, and occasionally controversial, worldwide business icon for more than three decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Recognized by most as an ingenious visionary, and painted by some as a tyrannical, less-than-scrupulous empire builder, Gates has had an unignorable impact on the growth of digital technology in daily life over the past 30 years. Even his sharpest critics have to acknowledge the obvious: Gates helped spearhead one of the greatest revolutions in modern history by seizing on the importance of software to the rise of the personal computer, along the way turning an arcane, specialized technology into a commonplace tool for the office and home.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Gates has long been ranked as one of the world&amp;#8217;s wealthiest men--which gave him a name recognition far greater than that of most CEOs--and businesspeople of all stripes have looked to him as a role model, using his words and business strategies to help create, inspire, and grow their own companies. After he stopped running Microsoft&#39;s day-to-day operations in 2008 to devote himself full-time to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, a kinder, gentler Gates began to emerge. As a result, people actively involved in the philanthropic world, whether in professional, part-time, or personal capacities, began to develop a new appreciation for the man.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bill Gates&amp;#8217;s second act is no less compelling than his first. And whether you&amp;#8217;re interested in his personal life or looking for inspiration to drive you forward in your own business endeavors, &lt;I&gt;Impatient Optimist: Bill Gates in His Own Words&lt;/I&gt; has much to offer. As the tech giants who distinguished the turn of the 21st century shape public life in ways that outstrip the efforts of the previous century&#39;s titans of industry, we look to figures like Gates for inspiration as one of America&#39;s greatest business icons. This book will surely feed the world&#39;s curiosity about one of the most important leaders of the digital age.&lt;/div&gt;" />
