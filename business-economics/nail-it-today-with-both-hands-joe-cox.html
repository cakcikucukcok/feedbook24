  <title>Nail It Today with Both Hands - Joe Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Would you have enjoyed being a captive anthropoid in a zoo 100 years ago?  Today, modern zoological parks simulate the natural habitats of the species in their sanctuaries.  Gorillas and chimps thrive and reproduce. Many are released back into the wild. But in the corporate world management doesnt seem to know the normal conditions for Homo sapiens to perform at his best, and sadly dont care to learn.  Anthropology, biology, psychology and sociology each teach us what Homo sapiens need to flourish.  It is an enriched habitat that satisfies the needs and desires of hominids as they hunt and gather and compete for territory in the Corporate Zoo.  
Homo sapiens have two motivators that determine the effort they will put into work and how long they will continue doing it. Managers must sustain those motivations - with a two-handed approach that leaves no doubt that it produces profit.  At a minimum, readers will figure out what they need from their bosses to fly after their goals. Managers will learn what drives team members and that they are dufuses if they dont provide it.  Companies will rethink the order of their priorities if they want to be more profitable.  The tools included in Nail it Today seal the deal in this one-of-a-kind eye-opening revelation on business.  You wont put it down and you cant ignore it.  It hits too hard." />
