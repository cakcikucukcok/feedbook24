  <title>Soul Care - Carolyn J Sweers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Soul care, said Socrates, was the most important activity a human could do.&amp;nbsp; It was far more important than such common human concerns as the desire for money or honor (&amp;ldquo;likes&amp;rdquo; on Facebook?).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socrates demonstrated by example what he meant by soul care: 1) a realistic attitude about death, 2) the importance of an examined life, 3) recognition of the limits of human understanding, and 4) the responsibility of being a good citizen.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As this book tries to show, these Socratic themes are very similar to the three Lenten practices: fasting, almsgiving, and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lent begins on Ash Wednesday&amp;mdash;a stark reminder of mortality and the importance of focusing on things that really matter.&amp;nbsp; Fasting, though traditionally associated with food, has a broader meaning of refraining from any and all impediments to spiritual development.&amp;nbsp; Almsgiving is a practice made necessary by the interconnectedness of the human community.&amp;nbsp; Prayer is the practice of recognizing what I call the &amp;ldquo;framing Mystery&amp;rdquo; of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though nothing in the book is inconsistent with the Christian practices as I have understood and lived them, the intent of the book is to describe the essentials of soul care in such a way as to engage the reader.&amp;nbsp; It is hoped that this engagement will lead to the sort of examined life that Socrates said was so essential.&amp;nbsp; Come.&amp;nbsp; See for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;" />
