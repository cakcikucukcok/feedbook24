  <title>Out from the Shadows - Dr. Bill Effler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The beach has always been a safe place for me where the concerns of life all but disappear. One late afternoon I was walking directly into the sun. I barely noticed its final descent toward the horizon. As I glanced back, I caught my shadow. It seemed so big; my heart was imprisoned by an imperfect replica, an emotional stalkerseen only as I turned away from the suns radiance. It was then I realized when I walk facing the Light I will see no shadow. Only a life lived out from the shadow will experience the grandeur of God; the Accusers maligning voice will be stilled. That day I came to grasp that the shadow of a persons past is not how God sees any of His children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Effler writes with clarity, biblical expertise, personal counseling experience, and a passion for each minister to succeed in Christ. This book will change your life in a marvelous way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Care and Director, Church of God International Headquarters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out From the Shadows creates a therapeutic approach to the creation account found in Genesis. This material resonates with the substance abuse community by identifying possible areas of brokenness often overlooked. Boldly discussing sin rather than symptomology, Out From the Shadows cogently dissects root issues throughout the counseling process. Although primarily intended for pastoral counselors, this information can be utilized in a wide array of counseling venues.&lt;/p&gt;
