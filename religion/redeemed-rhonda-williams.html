  <title>Redeemed - Rhonda Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Much more than a great love story, the book of Ruth tells of redemption, sacrifice, and the price that was paid to buy freedom. In Redeemed, author Rhonda Williams offers a ten-week womens Bible study focusing on the book of Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study examines various aspects of the book of Ruth, the Bibles greatest heroine, and considers how her story applies to todays world. It depicts a picture of Jesus and how he chose you, loved you, and paid the ultimate price to purchase your freedom from sin and set you free. It paints a picture of the figures of Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz and their relationships, family issues, love, loyalty, bitterness, death, hunger, and more, recognizing the stark contrast between Naomi and Ruth, their responses to lifes trials and the ways those responses affect each of them and bring blessings. Finally, it invites you to dig deeper into the biblical text and your life through study questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the figures in the book of Ruth, Redeemed helps you visualize the pain of their trials and then experience the joy of being redeemed. Ruths story communicates that no matter who or where you are, you have hopeand that hope is in Jesus Christ, redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
