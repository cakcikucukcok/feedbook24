  <title>Talking God: Preaching to Contemporary Congregations - Albert R. Cutié</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today&#39;s church has a digital dilemma: We live in an age where &quot;new media&quot; is inescapable, yet many still perceive these new forms of communication as either an unmanageable challenge or at odds with the mission of the church. Clergy and lay leaders alike can be at a loss as to what methodologies, practices, and adjustments are necessary to engage today&#39;s congregations. How can we effectively meet the challenges of our present context?  In Talking God, Fr. Cutié, whose wide following spans both traditional and new media, starts where preaching the gospel has always started, with a preacher and an audience, and examines the challenges digital communications pose to all involved in the craft of preaching, including the way contemporary audiences receive and listen to the message preached. Is the 21st century church responding to this evolution by seeking to understand the present-day &quot;listening context&quot; and the often overwhelming &quot;media culture&quot; in which it is called to preach? Must preachers and teachers of the Word of God evolve in style and practice to continue being effective communicators of the gospel? Has the world changing around us changed our methodology or even our message?" />
