  <title>Do Angels Really Exist? - Dr. Sandra Carter Snyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some questions seem to never be answered. Sometimes if there are answers, people tend to keep asking these questions, because they find the answers hard to accept. One of those questions concerns the existence of angels. While many people consider their existence a given, others are doubters.&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Sandra Carter Snyders &lt;i&gt;Do Angels Really Exist?&lt;/i&gt; provides insight and answers to questions at the heart of many discussions about angels. People have reported encounters with angels in times of extreme despair and even during moments of serenity. Using scriptural references, Snyder helps you discover the truth about angels, including what angels are, why they were created, who fallen angels are, and whether one should worship angels. She shares real-life experiences with angels and explains how to detect the presence of angels in your life.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Do Angels Really Exist?&lt;/i&gt; will help you discover the angels around youand why they are there. As a result, you can have a spiritually enhanced life and show others what can happen when they embrace the angels in their lives." />
