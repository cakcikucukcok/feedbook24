  <title>Spirituality for Peace and Justice - Elizabeth Padillo Olesen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book on Christian Spirituality
This is a book of poems on Christian spirituality as response to personal crises in life, woes and struggles of women, natural calamities, violence and terror. This book expresses poetic sensitivity to some events in our history that reflect conflicts in culture, religion and ideologies. This is spirituality from the eyes of faith, attempting to read the signs of our time in the light of the source of love and life that has called us to be responsible stewards as we commit ourselves to acts of love, compassion, peace and justice.
These poems were written during my time as a student, teacher, pastor, ecumenical and community worker in the Philippines, as a missionary in Nepal, teacher, wife, mother, and as a cultural worker in Denmark, stretching a period of more than twenty years. I offer this book of poems to those who seek life, to those who despair, and to those who want to be inspired. Christian spirituality is in the human heart in its encounter with the wounded and resurrected Christ.
In celebrating beauty and human creativity, I have illustrated some poems with my own paintings done during my integration process as a foreigner in Denmark.  (EPO)" />
