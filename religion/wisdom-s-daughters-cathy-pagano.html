  <title>Wisdom’S Daughters - Cathy Pagano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wisdom is Womens Gift to the World. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In the many cultural stories that speak about the changing of the ages, it is always Feminine Spirit which brings about the transition to new life, for Feminine Spirit knows the rhythms of life, death, and rebirth and is the opener of the way. In times of cultural transformation, it is also our right-brain, feminine consciousness that is our best guide, for it opens us to the creative imagination, the realm of possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The return of the Goddess awakens the transformative energy that births the changing of the ages. In the western story of worldwide spiritual transformation, there is a powerful image of Cosmic Woman, an image of the archetypal Feminine Spirit who transforms and gives birth to this new age. And her archetypal image gives us instructions for opening to and incarnating wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image of the awakening Feminine Spirit is an image of the Conscious Woman: a woman, clothed with the sun, standing on the moon, crowned with stars, who is in labor, giving birth to a savior. In earlier times and different traditions, this archetypal image was understood as Lady Wisdom. Today I feel this Goddess image of conscious woman can be incarnated by women everywhere. This woman clothed with the sun is Lady Wisdom, who calls all women to become her daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Cathys insights into fairy tales, mythology, dreams, astrological energies, and archetypes. She makes sense of how our lives are impacted by these complex yet very beautiful elements, making them accessible and keeping them profound. Her wisdom can only enhance anyone lucky enough to have crossed her path.&lt;br /&gt;
