  <title>Above the Horizons - Rodney Neu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the act of writing this book I have found many consistencies in our lives that are relevant to Gods word. I owe my life to God.  What words we speak then that will become of ourselves. Of we expect mental breakdown, loss of our dreams; then that shall it be. We must wake up with an agenda. Have a course of action when arising from the bed. If you speak words that delay your success then that becomes a day of loss. How many of those can you handle? As long as your mind fulfills the capacity of not changing, staying in the same situation, not building a foundation, you will find yourself on the course of destruction. Let me tell you this right now you are more than what you think about yourself, you are more than what your relationships are, you are more than that house payment, you are more than what that car makes you think you are, in fact think of those times your life should have been over but you are still here. 
Keep getting up again and again till you get it right. You will have indications that will bring you to a greater purpose. Refuse to let the challenges of life bring you down. Never let the mastery of failure discourage your right to speak, to live and to bring existence to your honor so that others can learn.  Be challenged for the right reasons." />
