  <title>Table Matters: The Sacraments, Evangelism, and Social Justice - Felicia Howell LaBoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In many churches, the work of evangelism and social justice is relegated to clergy, staff, or special committees. Rarely do most members of the laity believe they should or even want to engage in the tasks of evangelism and social justice. In this volume, LaBoy contends that participation in baptism and Eucharist mandates for all Christians--and those who are Wesleyan in their orientation, in particular--that evangelism and social justice are not optional but in fact integral to their worship and witness. She argues that this understanding and practice of the integration of sacraments, evangelism, and social justice are what can help churches deal with contemporary issues of decline and church disenfranchisement by both congregants and those beyond church walls. LaBoy further argues that making the sacraments central to the worship life of congregations is what made early Methodists great evangelists and advocates for social justice." />
