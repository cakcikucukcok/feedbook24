  <title>Soundings in the Christian Mystical Tradition - Harvey D. Egan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called in a special way to listen to God&#39;s whispers, the mystics amplify not only what it means to be baptized into the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ &#39;and to having the Trinity living in them &#39;but also what is deepest in the human spirit. Mystics experience themselves as an infinite question to which only God is the answer; as an immense longing that only Love can quench; as a nothing in the face of the No-Thing. They are God&#39;s fools, troubadours &#39;the great artists and poets of the interior life whose learned ignorance&quot; articulates the art of loving God, neighbor, self, the Church, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Soundings in the Christian Mystical Tradition&lt;/i&gt; Harvey Egan draws on fifty years of reading and teaching the mystics to sketch the varieties and passion of the mystical life across more than two millennia. Through their stories and words Egan reveals that al were conscious of the paradox of human identity &#39;supremely and unsurpassably manifested in the God-Man &#39;that the genuinely human is disclosed only through surrender to God and that the search for God cannot bypass the genuinely human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harvey D. Egan, SJ, is the author of numerous works on Christian mysticism and the thought of Karl Rahner. He is currently professor of systematic and mystical theology at Boston College.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
