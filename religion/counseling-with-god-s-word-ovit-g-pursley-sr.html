  <title>Counseling with God’S Word - Ovit G. Pursley Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From marriage to divorce, and from adultery to the Word of God, author and pastor Ovit G. Pursley Sr. has compiled a comprehensive list of scripture messages to address a wide range of issues that affect todays Christians.
Geared toward pastors, ministers, deacons, and all church members, &lt;i&gt;Counseling with Gods Word&lt;/i&gt; provides Bible-based guidance. The first section addresses family-related issues, such as marriage, husbands, wives, parents, children and child training, youth, and divorce. The second section covers everything from A to W, including alcohol and drug use, anger, charity, faith, guilt, laziness, poverty, prayer, shame, sickness, tithing, and wisdom.
The messages delivered in &lt;i&gt;Counseling with Gods Word&lt;/i&gt; serve to save, teach, strengthen, and establish believers in the faith and are a guide for learning to live a Christian existence through the words of the Bible.
&lt;i&gt;Genesis 2:18, 24
And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&lt;/i&gt;" />
