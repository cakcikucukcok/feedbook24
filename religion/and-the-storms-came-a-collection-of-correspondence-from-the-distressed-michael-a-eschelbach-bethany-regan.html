  <title>And the Storms Came: A Collection of Correspondence from the Distressed - Michael A. Eschelbach, Bethany Regan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do I know what is true? Can we really be certain of what the Bible says? What will happen to me when I die?  In moments of honesty, has there been any person who hasn&#39;t entertained these questions? Moreover, when these thoughts plague the mind, it&#39;s tempting to believe that no one else considers these things; no one else experiences the same fears. This book--a collection of letters--bears witness that such distress is not new, and does not need to be borne alone. Each correspondence is real, and is based around a different person&#39;s struggle with the weighty issues--free will, doubts of salvation, the truth of the Bible, and finding peace. The contributors are nothing alike--different ages, education, backgrounds, and circumstances. Yet they are all hurting.  In response, they are each provided with answers. These answers aren&#39;t from a radical new approach. No innovative method of self-help is revealed. What is put forward is the simple truth that is found in God&#39;s Word, and in a comprehensive, real, and straightforward way. Misconceptions and fallacies are broken down, and biblical guidance is offered, addressing difficult issues that apply to both Christians and non-Christians alike." />
