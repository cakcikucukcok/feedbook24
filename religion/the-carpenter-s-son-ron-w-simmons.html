  <title>The Carpenter’S Son - Ron W. Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is humanitys ultimate destiny? Could there be life beyond the grave?  What is genuine spirituality? These questions and many more are answered by a carpenters son, Jesus, born in ancient Judaea two thousand years ago. He healed thousands, yet never received medical training. He taught in streets, homes, and temples, yet never achieved scholarly status. He demanded perfection, yet chose the imperfect to follow him. He spoke of the arrival of an eternal kingdom, yet he never ran for political office or led a nation. He spoke of peace and love, yet led the greatest counter-revolutionary effort in human history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despised by his critics and revered by societys lowest members, Jesus still speaks to our deficiencies as well as our weaknesses, and assures a redemption we could never achieve on our own. Out of an original rebellion, we all face a self-imposed defeat by pointlessly attempting to establish our own kingdoms despite confronting the same abysmal fate. Yet, God has achieved the greatest comeback in history by conquering death, and in doing so, has prepared for us a victory we could not possibly imagine, for to lose all is to gain all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
