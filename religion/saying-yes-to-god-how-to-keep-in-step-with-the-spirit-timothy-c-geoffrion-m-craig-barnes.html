  <title>Saying Yes to God: How to Keep in Step with the Spirit - Timothy C. Geoffrion, M. Craig Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Saying Yes to God is written to help maturing Christians better recognize the voice of God and the leading of the Holy Spirit. The book is a practical resource for those looking for fresh insight to break through barriers and personal limitations in their relationship with God. In effect, this book offers hope to all those who earnestly want to know God better and to live Christ-centered, Spirit-led lives. Readers will not feel judged or shamed, but will hear a gentle but firm and persistent call to believe that God truly is at work in their lives, calling and leading them. Not only can they learn to recognize the Spirit&#39;s voice better, but they can learn how to work with God in tremendously satisfying and fruitful ways. This book&#39;s particular contribution lies in its simple presentation of important spiritual concepts, use of illustrations drawn from the author&#39;s spiritual life coaching practice and global teaching ministry, and special emphasis on how to love others better as an outflow of one&#39;s faith and personal relationship with God." />
