  <title>Principles of a Fruitful Life - Stephen Ifekoya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Principles of a Fruitful Life is a book written in the midst of a revelation to urge every Christian to strive and become fruitful in life. It identifies that Fruitfulness is a subject that must be addressed by all and sundry who desire to fulfill purpose. And that the kingdom of God has accomplished so much in other areas of the business of the kingdom, but when we consider individuals fruitfulness, we are lagging behind. It suggests that more practical programs that will emphasize the principles involved in bearing fruit should be planned so that the vision of God for His kingdom can become a reality.
This book presents the following as the principles involved in living a fruitful life:
	Abiding in the Vine
	Cleansing through the Word of God
	Understanding the voice of the Master
	Walking in Gods commandment of love
 Walking in what God has ordained for your life
The principles outlined are secrets exposed to bless anyone who strives to be relevant in the program of God for His kingdom. If you have such a godly desire, this is a book you must read." />
