  <title>Being “In Christ” - Dr. Glen E. Clifton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Glen E. Clifton&lt;/b&gt; became pastor of his first church at age nineteen while attending Baylor University. He and his wife Dee have had four children. He has been pastor of Southern Baptist churches in Texas twice, Mississippi, and California twice, with three interim pastorates in Florida. He retired to the Treasure Coast of Florida, where he has been serving churches for the past eleven years. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A native Texan, Clifton is a graduate of Baylor University (BA), New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary (MRE), and Louisiana Baptist University (DMin). He has also taught in public schools in four states, as well as Seminary Extension of N.O.B.T.S. He has had the privilege of speaking and preaching revivals in almost twenty states. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifton has also served as a church planter in areas with no church. Most of the churches he pastored have led their association in baptisms, church growth, and mission giving in California, Mississippi, and Texas. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Cliftons second book. His first, &lt;i&gt;What All New Christians Should Know&lt;/i&gt;, is a quick-start book for new Christians. It is in its fourth printing. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although retired, Clifton fills the pulpit almost every Sunday somewhere on the southeast coast of Florida. &lt;p&gt;" />
