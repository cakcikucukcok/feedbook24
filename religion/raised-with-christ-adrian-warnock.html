  <title>Raised with Christ - Adrian Warnock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus truly is alive today. But compared to his atoning death, Jesus&#39; resurrection sparks relatively little discussion in the church. Inadvertently,we can become so focused on the good news that Christ died for our sins, that we almost forget he was &quot;raised for our justification&quot; (Romans 4:25).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Raised with Christ&lt;/em&gt;, author Adrian Warnock exhorts Christians not to neglect the resurrection in their teaching and experience. Warnock takes his cue from Acts, where every recorded sermon focuses on Jesus&#39; resurrection. He stresses that Christians who faithfully proclaim both the death &lt;span&gt;and the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and live out the implications of that message in vibrant,grace-filled churches, will be enabled to reach a world that lives in death&#39;s dark shadow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The power of the risen Christ is active in every true Christian, transforming our lives. &lt;em&gt;Raised with Christ&lt;/em&gt; will help you discover afresh the massive implications of the empty tomb. Jesus&#39; resurrection really has changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
