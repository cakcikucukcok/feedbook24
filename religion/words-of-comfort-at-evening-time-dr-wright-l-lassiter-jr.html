  <title>Words of Comfort at Evening Time - Dr. Wright L. Lassiter Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a loved one dies, it is often a challenging task to offer comfort to family members and friends while simultaneously celebrating a life now lifted into the heavens. In his collection of selected reflections about life, death, and everlasting love, Baptist minister and author Dr. Wright Lassiter Jr. shares words of comfort he has provided grieving families at past funeral services with the hope of providing encouragement to todays bereaved.
Lassiter has served as minister for several churches and relies on his experience interacting with other pastors and worshippers to share his inspirational wisdom and applicable scriptures in the second edition of &lt;i&gt;Words of Comfort at Evening Time.&lt;/i&gt; Included in Lassiters compilation are consoling messages delivered at two churches in Dallas, Texas; resolutions of comfort extended to family members; and additional funeral messages, including the one delivered at his own fathers memorial service.
Through his inspiring reflections, Lassiter helps the grieving to realize that a walk through the shadow of death is a celebration of a full life and provides encouragement to those left behind to live each day knowing that death is not the end, but the beginning of an eternity with God." />
