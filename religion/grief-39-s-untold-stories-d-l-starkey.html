  <title>Grief&#39;s Untold Stories - D. L. Starkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The journey of grief is not one that we would have chosen for ourselves.  No one understands the true pain of your sorrow but you.  Sometimes we feel alone in our grief.  Does anyone understand?  Is there any way to put a positive spin on our terrible loss?  Does God truly understand what we are going through?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has not abandoned you, even though at times it feels that way.  Where is God in our pain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is never more real than right now.  You will read stories of others who have faced deaths door and attained victory through Jesus Christ.  You will discover a God who not only cares but intervenes at the intersection of belief and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit will join you on this journey.  Allow him to minister to you as you walk through the pages of this book and witness Gods power to heal!&lt;/p&gt;" />
