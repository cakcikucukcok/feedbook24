  <title>The Preaching of Pope Francis: Missionary Discipleship and the Ministry of the Word - Gregory Heille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Since the beginning of his pontificate, Pope Francis has encouraged, inspired, and delighted those who have heard him preach. Especially fascinating have been his plain-spoken and insightful weekday morning Mass homilies. He has also offered the church a substantial contribution on the theory and practice of homiletics in a large section of his first major teaching document, &lt;I&gt;Evangelii Gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel)&lt;/I&gt;. In &lt;I&gt;The Preaching of Pope Francis&lt;/I&gt;, Gregory Heille, OP, introduces readers to the Pope&amp;rsquo;s preaching, his insights about the preaching vocation of the ordained, and his call to all the baptized to go to the margins as missionary disciples and evangelists of the Word.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Heille, a highly regarded professor of homiletics and preacher himself, offers an inspiring and practical resource for priests, deacons, and anyone involved in the ministry of preaching. He shares the Pope&amp;rsquo;s vision and example for the preparation and delivery of effective and engaging homilies and for laity invested in the Church&amp;rsquo;s ministry of the Word in a post-Vatican II pastoral context.&lt;/div&gt;" />
