  <title>NIGHTFALL : Descent of the Species - dhiraj gaurh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a compilation of simple philosophical essays. Most of them are radical, extremist and even revolutionary. The thread that binds the essays is nature and the present state of the environment. The purpose of these essays is to rend apart the fabric of society and cause a sea change in the behavior and thought processes of this civilization. They seek the hidden truths of today&#39;s modern world. The aim is not to make people happier with their current state in life. So come with me and seek God&#39;s purpose in our lives. There is a search for truth here and some answers and a silent appeal to save nature and God&#39;s creatures.    I believe that the time has come to take radical steps to protect nature, otherwise all is lost. The market is full of books which preach how to be successful and rich. This book is the anti-thesis to them all. This is the path of renunciation and happiness.     WARNING : This book might  make you feel sick.    The author was born in Jaipur, India and went to school there. He got his B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Delhi in 1996. He has always been an environmentalist and loves to read fiction and philosophy." />
