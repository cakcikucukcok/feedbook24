  <title>On Our Way - Dorothy Bass, Susan Briehl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early adulthood is a time of possibility, uncertainty, decision, and hope. During these years, individuals determine how they will approach life challenges and opportunities. In *On Our Way: Christian Practices for Living a Whole Life**, writers from a variety of backgrounds address topics of particular relevance to young adults. The essays are grouped in five sections that together express the whole: Living a whole life;
attentively; together; in the real world; with all; for the good of all; in
response to God.
*On Our Way** looks at common subjects in fresh, meaningful ways. It presents &quot;study,&quot; for example, as &quot;not synonymous with reading books or with academic reflection, though it may well include these.&quot; Instead, this essay explains study as &quot;a particular kind of attending to Christ and the world, a particular stance of curiosity, vigilance, and openness to learning—an openness that extends even to unlearning what we have previously learned to take for granted.&quot; Other chapters explore
such subjects as discerning God&#39;s call, friendship and intimacy, care for creation, knowing and loving our neighbors of other faiths, and doing justice.
As young adults move away from the confines of home, school, and church youth group, this book will serve as an excellent resource. While it speaks from a Christian perspective, its broad approach makes it appealing both to Christians and to those who consider themselves &quot;spiritual but not religious.&quot; Well-suited for individual
reading or group discussion, *On Our Way** is an excellent companion for young adults seeking their place in today&#39;s world." />
