  <title>His Promise . . . 20 Years Later - Candra Colla Niswanger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This author&#39;s story is compelling and heartfelt. She opens her book with an intriguing vision from God and then presents her background and testimony with honesty and enthusiasm. The author is candid about difficult experiences she has had, but she is also optimistic and contagiously excited about her life in Christ. This is a human story that readers will relate to easily, and it is written with inspiring wisdom and authority. The author&#39;s skillful use of narrative and her occasional interweaving of Bible verses make her book both moving and useful to read. 
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;&#39;Trust in Me&#39; - Track 4 on my CD Candra All4Him  was the inspiration for my book His Promise. . .  20 Years Later. I know this story will touch your life and encourage you. This song was the first song God placed on my heart of many  I have written, and one of the last to be recorded on my recent CD. My hope and prayer is that you will be encouraged and lifted up as you rest in a time of worship and feed your soul with His word and praises.&quot; - Candra
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The Lord has moved mountains in my life that seemed impossible. Today my son, Payton, is a kind, thoughtful, loving, and a beautiful servant of the Living God who seeks His face in everything he does on a daily basis. Payton has dedicated his life to furthering the Kingdom of God through his music, photography, street ministries, and heart for pastoring." />
