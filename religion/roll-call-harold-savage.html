  <title>Roll Call - Harold Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Harold Savage vividly remembers the last time he activated his blue lights during the final shift he worked as a police officer for the city of West Palm Beach, Florida. He spotted a Ford with New York tags which was being sought nationally in connection with a homicide. He radioed HQ his location and the tag number of the vehicle. All north end units were out of service. No backup! With his blue lights flashing, Harold pursued the black Ford. It slowed but did not stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you will never have the experience of serving as a police officer. So you, the reader, could ride along and be Harolds partner. You could learn from his mistakes as well as his successes. These thirteen powerful lessons contain wisdom for daily living, challenging each of us to live a daring, bold, and productive life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is your spiritual roll call. You have reported for duty, and you must be alert. In this roll call, God, through His Word, will conduct the briefing. Imaginethe highest-ranking supervisor in the universe will be providing you with vital information. The Maker and Sustainer of all things will give you what you need to not just survive but thrive during your tour of duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its time to report for roll call.&lt;/p&gt;" />
