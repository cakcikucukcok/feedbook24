  <title>I Am ‘Mind’ I Am ‘Consciousness’ - Titus Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I AM Mind, I AM Consciousness, delivers a dramatic spiritual development of the original metaphysical ideas disclosed in the authors previous work, entitled, Our Curious World of Mirror Images. I AM Mind, utilizes the same paradigm as a pair of corrective lens to take a whole new look at the vast universe, the omnipresent expanse of space and time, to reveal a new radical and enhanced, intelligent view of the Cosmos. This original perspective assimilates our ideas of the invisible GOD of Abraham, reconciling it with empirical science, to disclose GOD in the form of our magnificent transparent universe. 
With the introduction of this bold new concept of GOD, the author then revisits ancient sacred texts bringing them to light in whole new ways that open our eyes, to increase understanding; and, remind us again of GOD.  We are then able, by virtue of this meaningful new paradigm, to see GOD everywhere and in everything. GOD then becomes increasingly accessible to us to the extent that we experience GOD in our daily lives.  
When was the last time you read something entirely new and original that resonates in you as truth, is confirmed by science, and elicits a spiritual impulse by its nature? 
Do you seek higher thoughts and concepts to meditate on, to promote emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being?
Are you seeking to reconcile our ideas of GOD with reality, or perhaps, seeking meaning in life; then this is the book for you! 
Read On, I Promise You..." />
