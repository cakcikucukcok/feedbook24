  <title>God&#39;s Amazing Answer to Prayer - Jim Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author wrote this book because he felt an obligation to God to use the information he received from God in a responsible way to help others come to know more about God, and to give many non-believers more reasons to believe in God, by documenting God&#39;s interaction with him. This book starts with an introduction and a brief history of the author. The author had several incredible personal experiences with God, and this book is especially about one of those experiences. The author states that God gave him a verbal answer to his prayer that revealed more about God and His Kingdom than is currently thought to be true and accepted. The author then felt a need to share with Christians and non-Christians this Godly event and message. The book also gives a simple guide for non-believers to get on track with God. The book details some of the other signs and miracles that happened in the author&#39;s own life. This book also tells of God&#39;s revelation as to where Heaven is, AND where God is --- physically. The author explains that God helped him during several recent personal, medical and financial periods in his life. The book emphasizes that you should always put God #1 in your life, so that you may have access to eternal life as described in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
