  <title>The Conclusion to the Whole Matter - Paul Douglas Castle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the author of The Conclusion to the Whole Matter, I conclude its a risk of emotions to read this book. Because The Conclusion to the Whole Matter is a two-edged sword that cuts through myths, pagan practices, abominations, and the detestable traditions of men that are manifested in our society, and also in the churches of God. The Conclusion to the Whole Matter will stir up different emotions in all readers that read its contents, because The Conclusion to the Whole Matter will not let you see the world of Christianity as you once imagined it to be. The rose-colored glasses that most people view Christianity through may not seem so rosy after reading The Conclusion to the Whole Matter. But The Conclusion to the Whole Matter is the whole truth based on the word of God. In our society today men abhor the truththey twist and veil it in darkness and insincerity. The Conclusion to the Whole Matter unveils hidden things that professing Christians might wish would stay hidden from the light. The contents of this book are devoted to the feelings and emotions of God. The Bible consists of approximately 782,000 words. The Conclusion to the Whole Matter is summed up in six words. But its taken me approximately 190,000 words to put definition to The Conclusion to the Whole Matter. In the last days it will be 144,000 men of God and a flying angel who preach the last gospel on earth. The last gospel preached will be The Conclusion to the Whole Matter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
