  <title>Living in the Spirit - Ron Andrea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Building understanding and confidence in Gods plan, Living in the Spirit offers insights into the book of Romans and outlines the role of todays believers.&lt;br /&gt;Author Ron Andrea discusses the richness of Pauls message to help modern Christians grasp and apply it to their lives by considering how Paul and all Christians are called to respond to and represent the good news of Jesus; showing how modern Christians feel Gods wrath like those of Pauls day because of idolatry, hypocrisy, and pride; and outlining Gods loving provision of Jesus as the answer to sin. He also describes how God provides a righteousness to restore us to the relationship to God which Adam enjoyed before the fall and reveals why faith is basic in believing in God but also to relating to God. &lt;br /&gt;Including a helpful study guide, Living in the Sprit exhorts you to explore a closer relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for Living in the Spirit&lt;br /&gt;Many helpful (if sometimes uncomfortable) insights.&lt;br /&gt;Wallace Gray, PhD, Emeritus Kirk Chair of Philosophy, Southwestern College&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is prime reading for those who truly want to grow spiritually and desire to get closer to Jesus. The material is succinct, straightforward, and easy to read, yet filled with insights that will help fulfill Gods calling for your life to walk with him in the spirit.&lt;br /&gt;Gary Garner, senior pastor, &lt;br /&gt;Prevailing Word Ministries&lt;/p&gt;" />
