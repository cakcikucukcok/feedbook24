  <title>God Cannot Lower the Standard, Quality, and Perfection of His Law - Zolile Ntshona</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God Cannot Lower the Standard, Quality, and Perfection of His Law addresses divisions between Christians, particularly on the issues of the law of God and the grace of God. The tendency reflects what Paul corrected in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean is this, that each one of you [either] says, I belong to Paul, or I belong to Apollos, or I belong to Cephas (Peter), or I belong to Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Christ (the Messiah) divided into parts? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 1:1213 (AMPC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, You must not covet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 7:67 (NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul raised this question, knowing very well that people would conclude that being released from the law meant there is something wrong with the law of God. People might believe that the law of God, unlike the grace of God, is identical with sin or that it has shortfalls. The latter belief is incorrect. The verse emphasizes that the law of God is not identical with sin. Although we are aware of the requirements of God through His law, the challenge is its fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law of God is not identical with sin. The main problem is that, as people, we are unable to fulfill the laws requirements, because of its standard, quality, and perfection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
