  <title>Light of the Harvest - Angela Goonewardene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lord gave me a vision of a book; the name was Light of the Harvest. A page in the booklet was opened and I saw the face of Jesus, and facing that page were many families and people, and there were many more blank pages in the book. I had no clue at that time. Within a couple of months the Lord showed me in a dream to start the next page of the same book, with Jesus and me and I started writing my personal testimony. 
As I was thinking of the name Light of the Harvest the Lord revealed to me that Jesus was the Light and the People were the Harvest. 
Many times the Lord had spoken to me to Write the vision, and make it plain on tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry. (Habakkuk 2:2-3)
In obedience to the Lord I have completed another upgraded version of the Light of the Harvest book. I praise God for the leading and guiding of the Holy Spirit in enabling me to establish what He wants me to establish relating to His marvellous work in my life." />
