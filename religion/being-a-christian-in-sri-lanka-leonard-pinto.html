  <title>Being a Christian in Sri Lanka - Leonard Pinto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most people know something about their own religions. That knowledge is usually restricted to what is going on at the present time. When it comes to how their religions developed in their countries, their knowledge is on shakier grounds. As for religion in foreign lands, well, for many, that information is nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Leonard Pintos &lt;i&gt;Being a Christian in Sri Lanka: Historical, Political, Social, and Religious Considerations&lt;/i&gt; is a critique based on the observations and experience of a Sri Lankan Christian. Pinto shares the history and importance of religion in his native land. Youll learn about Portuguese, Dutch, and British rule in the country formerly known as Ceylon, and how each affected religion there. Pinto dispels popular views about how ruling countries dealt with Christianity and other religions, and with those who practiced them. Youll learn how religion is practiced today from someone who lives it firsthand. Pintos book goes beyond the boundaries of Sri Lanka in assessing the problems faced by Christianity from the corrosive effects of the Age of Enlightenment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Being a Christian in Sri Lanka: Historical, Political, Social, and Religious Considerations&lt;/i&gt;, Pinto comes to the conclusion Sri Lanka would benefit from a Sri Lankan national identity for all its citizens. Hegemony based on ethnicity and religion is dissuaded. Youll also find Pintos conclusions relevant to other countries. &lt;/p&gt;" />
