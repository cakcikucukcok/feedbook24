  <title>Daughter of a Preacher Man - Anna Picard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This reflection, though brutally honest, provides insight to the conflicts that face the children of ministers, pastors, religious clergy, deacons, and church leaders. It challenges fellow Christians, to nurture the lives of these children without punishing judgments. This work provokes congregants and leaders to nurture preachers kids, and provide heartfelt guidance and vigilant prayer. It encourages prayer-warriors, to guard over the hearts of preachers kids.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book leads the reader toward self-examination and self-correction. The author makes a noteworthy disclaimer; I do not have a license in counseling, a degree in psychology or theology. I am not an elder or deacon in any church, nor do I hold office as a board member on any religious organization. I am not a minister, pastor or evangelist. I am neither an acclaimed author nor an authority of any kind. Forgive me if I have misquoted scripture or taken verses out of context. However I hope the Bible verses I have quoted throughout this book would not seem preachy; but then again, I am a preachers daughter. I trust that, these scriptures will grab at your hearts and soothe your soul-wounds. I hope they will provide a new perspective and they would be as you have never heard them or thought of them before. The author writes from a unique perspective, that of a preachers kid. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I am the voice of a group that is easily misunderstood and even shunned. We are the group that, should know better. Just being born into the subculture of preachers kids we are automatically judged by all, (the righteous and the unrighteous alike). We are expected to... by default, be good, be upright, make no mistakes, be all things to all men all of the time. We are to be mature in all judgments from the moment of birth, and on and on it goes. Few can comprehend our journey toward our Father on a road less traveled. This journey will be enlightening and comforting to all who read it. It will bring hope to those who are confused and lost. The book although empathetic to all parties, makes all accountable for their behaviors toward others and to the Heavenly Father. It is with great love and sensitivity that the author leads the reader to finding relationship with Jesus. Just for a moment, the reader can walk in the shoes of preachers kids with understanding and empathy. It brings much-needed direction and guidance. The author attempts to bridge the gap between all of you and preachers kids. It also attempts to reconcile the disconnection between preachers kids and Jesus. This work is raw and honest. It is a reflection of a lost generation who need to know the true power of redemption and the priceless gift of grace and love. &lt;/p&gt;" />
