  <title>Christian Science in the Light of Holy Scripture - Isaac Massey Haldeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is Christian Science? Is it Christianity, or is it something different? The 2015 revised edition of this classic book provides an in-depth analysis of the teachings of Christian Science compared to Biblical Christianity, with updated references to current Christian Science source texts. Readers will learn how Christian Science and Christianity are utterly incompatible by contrasting their teachings on topics like: sin, evil, death, sickness, Jesus, prayer, God and marriage. Readers may be surprised to learn that Christian Science teaches that: - “Man is incapable of sin, sickness, and death.” - “Evil is but an illusion… Evil is a false belief” - “Man is never sick” - “There is no death. The body cannot die.” - “Man is… neither young nor old. He has neither birth nor death.” - “The danger from prayer is that it may lead us into temptation.” - “God is… not a person” - “The theory of three persons in one God (that is, a personal Trinity or Tri-unity) suggests polythe¬ism” - “The spiritual Christ was infallible; Jesus, as material manhood, was not Christ.” - “Matter is the unreal” - “Jesus came to seek and to save such as believe in the reality of the unreal; to save them from this false belief…” - “Christ never died” - “The material blood of Jesus was no more efficacious to cleanse from sin, when it was shed upon ‘the accursed tree’ than when it was flowing through His veins, as He went daily about His Father’s business.”" />
