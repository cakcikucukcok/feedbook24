&lt;p&gt;What convinces you that there is a God?&lt;br /&gt;Can God do anything?&lt;br /&gt;Whats the difference between blind faith and reasonable faith?&lt;br /&gt;Whats the point of praying?&lt;br /&gt;Can you explain Gods timing?&lt;br /&gt;How can someone who has been really hurt extend Gods grace?&lt;/p&gt;
