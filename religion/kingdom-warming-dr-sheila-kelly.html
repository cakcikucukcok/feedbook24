  <title>Kingdom Warming - Dr. Sheila Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An ecologist observes the behavior of the bluebirds, 
The geologist exams the distribution of fossils, 
A chemist observes the rate of chemical reactions at various temperatures and pressures, 
A biologist observes the reactions of tissue in the presence of various stimulants, 
The meteorologist is one that studies the atmosphere and focuses on weather.
The prediction of local, national or international weather helps us plan  activities from playing outdoor tennis, rescheduling the weekend beach party or whether to expect flight delays.  Knowing the daily weather around us can help us decide the best garments for the day or the proper equipment we may need such as an umbrella, boots or wool scarf.
It is amazing how we study other planets, solar systems, come to the aid of other countries and their wars, but no one seems to take an interest in the undisputed climate changes happening within the Kingdom of God.  Our entire earth as we know it today is experiencing what is called Global Warming.  Global Warming is occurring because of human behavior and their activities.  Let us now consider the behavior and activities surrounding Kingdom dwellers as they too may be the direct result of     Kingdom Warming." />
