  <title>Coffee on the Porch with Jesus - Beverly R. Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reading these life lessons brings tears, laughter and general delightafter reading one, you cant wait to read the next one. I believe this little book will become a favorite of many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Character, Ed. D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retired Educational Leader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beverly opens the windows of her heart with a transparency that is much needed in these times. Her words are a fresh breath for any reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Billy Newell, M. A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founder/Director of Gateway School of Ministry, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beverlys writings leave you with the feeling that youre talking to an old friend who cares about you and wants you to be blessed with knowledge and the security of knowing youre loved, only to find out that the old friend sitting next to you is the Lord Himself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Dean Myers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harbor of Hope Assembly of God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ has called us, wooed us, redeemed us for a personal and eternal relationship with himnot the cold, distant relationship of a marble cathedral, nor the stuffy, over-heated relationship of a tabernacle in the desert, but a comfortable, intimate connection, like having coffee on the porch with a best friend. The quiet times spent with him are some of our most teachable moments if we speak from the heart and then prayerfully anticipate his response. Coffee On the Porch with Jesus is a collection of devotions and meditations drawn from my quiet moments.&lt;/p&gt;" />
