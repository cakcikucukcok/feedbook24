  <title>God Paying Every Man His Due - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Francis Woodcock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Francis Woodcock, A.B. (1614-1649) was a faithful member of the Westminster Assembly, esteemed as a scholar and an excellent Reformed preacher.   How do you honor God? What does it mean to give God honor, or for that matter, to give him glory? Francis Woodcock explains this most important topic in that, whether God is honored, or dishonored, so God in turn, honors men or dishonors them in judgment. His main text is 1 Samuel 2:30, &quot;For them that honor me, I will honor; and them that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.&quot; He shows the benefits of honoring God, and detriments of dishonoring him. God will never, ever, give away his &quot;glory and honor.&quot;  Also added to this treatise is a second work called, &quot;Christ&#39;s Warning to His Church of His Coming,&quot; which is a powerful sermon on Rev. 16:15.  This work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions." />
