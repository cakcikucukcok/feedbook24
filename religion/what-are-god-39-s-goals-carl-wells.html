  <title>What Are God&#39;s Goals? - Carl Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does God Have Goals?
We human beings tend to be pretty self-absorbed.  We have goals, and we hope to meet those goals--whether they are wise or unwise.
We seldom stop to consider that perhaps God also has goals.  If He does, they are certain to be wise, and He has the power to reach those goals.  But what are they?
Does God intend that mankind help Him reach His goals?
Does our current model of Christianity truly reflect what the Bible teaches?  Is the model flawed or broken?
What would a biblical model of Christianity look like?
Does God torture most people in Hell for eternity?  Or have we misread Scripture on that topic?
These are some of the questions wrestled with in What Are Gods Goals?" />
