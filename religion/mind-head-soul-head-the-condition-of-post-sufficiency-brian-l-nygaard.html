  <title>Mind-Head Soul-Head: The Condition of Post-Sufficiency - Brian L. Nygaard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Large and successful organizations seem to emulate the trajectory of a skipping stone. First they slow, and then they sink. Why does this happen over and over again? Most organizations come to believe that their problems stem from doing the wrong things. They are unfortunately looking in the wrong place. The problem with the demise of large and successful organizations is not related to what they are doing. The problem is rather in what they have actually become. And they simply fail to see it. It is only in understanding who we are that the sinking trajectory of large and successful organizations can be reversed. Mind-Head Soul-Head addresses this insidious situation and provides a human prescription as the cure." />
