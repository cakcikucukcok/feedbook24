  <title>The Truth About Roman Catholicism - Steve Urick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Catholic popes and Vatican councils have pronounced many teachings which, they say, are necessary to believe, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is necessary for salvation to submit to the Roman Pontiff.&lt;br /&gt;Christians must keep the law and do good works to be saved.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who says they are certain they are saved and going to heaven is anathema (cursed, damned as a heretic).&lt;br /&gt;Mary was immaculately conceived, remained a virgin her whole life, never sinned, was taken up body and soul into heaven, and exalted as the Queen of Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;Only priests can forgive sins after one confesses to them.&lt;br /&gt;Christians must purge some of their sins in Purgatory.&lt;br /&gt;Some people in non-Christian religions will be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are these, and many other Catholic dogmas, biblical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Truth About Roman Catholicism examines several key doctrines of the Catholic Church (as stated in the official Catechism of the Catholic Church) in light of the Bible. The reader will be shown the difference between the gospel of Christ and the gospel of Rome, and the crucial choice that must be made to obtain eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
