  <title>Enter Ye in at the Strait Gate - Louis A. Kelsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written with the enthusiasm of missionary zeal and the goal to deter people from the wide gate, &lt;i&gt;Enter Ye in at the Strait Gate&lt;/i&gt; presents the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the Mormons. Author Louis A Kelsch, a lifetime member of the Mormon Church who has served in various callings and capacities in his faith, offers an easy-to-understand interpretation of his religion to facilitate better understanding and acceptance of the dogma of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explains that the LDS Church is organized exactly like the church the Lord Jesus Christ created in the meridian of time. As a completely restored church, it continues today with the same beliefs, practices, and organization experienced by those early-day saints as presented in the New Testament writings of the King James Version of the Holy Bible. In this discussion, Kelsch examines and explains the Godhead, the Great Apostasy, the Restoration, the Book of Mormon, the principles of the gospel and the Scriptures, and the plan of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geared toward the investigator, those less active in faith, and those struggling with testimony, &lt;i&gt;Enter Ye in at the Strait Gate&lt;/i&gt; provides an outline of the fruits one can expect from being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/p&gt;" />
