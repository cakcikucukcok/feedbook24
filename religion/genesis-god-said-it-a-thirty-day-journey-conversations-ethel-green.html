  <title>Genesis God Said It… a Thirty- Day Journey &amp; Conversations - Ethel Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The beginning of all beginnings is proclaimed in Genesis. God began by creating the physical world and people with spiritual qualities (soul and spirit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis becomes part of the discipline of Bible reading and study begun by many each new year. Why not start at the beginning? we ask.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With that desire in place, my husband and I picked The Daily Bible In Chronological Order 365 Daily Readings (TDB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent extra time searching out the words of God, which contributed part of the title for my book, GOD SAID IT The expanded title, by adding A THIRTY-DAY JOURNEY, became the impetus for an expanded devotional based on Gods words and topics selected from them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gods highest creation, manincluding womanspent their first day resting along with their creator. WOW! Wouldnt you have liked to hear the conversation between them? It was Creator to created, Father to child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONVERSATIONS are imaginary words of God as He and the people of Genesis interact. The journey of Gods children developed into historyHis story. It is also the story of those who would be called Gods chosen people--the Jews. Some conversations extolled characteristics of heroes of the faith mentioned in Hebrews eleven.&lt;/p&gt;" />
