  <title>A Pastor&#39;s Story - Pastor Dave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What makes an ordinary man, husband, coach, or restaurant owner suddenly wake up one morning and wonder about God. David Stevens was just a regular guy making a living and providing for his wife and family and who loved to spend his weekends with friends having drinks, dancing, and sleeping in on Sunday morning. Dave figured he had plenty of time left to get things right, until the night he had the dream that made him realize that his life could end at any moment before he got things right with God. Daves search brought him to the realization that his life was not about Dave, but it was about God. Dave discovered that God had not just a plan for him but a calling on Daves life to go and tell people about the saving grace of Jesus Christ. Dave went from just an ordinary man to an extraordinary man of God who preaches and teaches about the salvation we can all receive through Jesus Christ.
Through the incredible teachings of Christ in the Bible and the testimonies of other godly men, Daves life was transformed from a man centered on what the world said was acceptable to a man who desired on what God said was acceptable. He met men and women whose lives had been changed because of their interaction with Christ through dreams, through life experiences, or through the revelation of Christ. Pastor Dave, as he is now known, shares his journey of coming to Christ through his own experience of meeting the Savior. As he was mentored by other men of God, Pastor Dave began to see the urgent need to share the love, mercy, and grace of surrendering ones life to Christ and sharing that message with his friends and family and finally to others.
