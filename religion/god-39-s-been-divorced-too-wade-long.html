  <title>God&#39;s Been Divorced Too - Wade Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Divorce can make someone feel that their life can never be right again. Where is God? Could he possibly understand? Would he even want to lead me through this? And why has this happened to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods Been Divorced Too provides a Christian answer to those questions. The fact that God himself has been divorced is utilized to break the usually powerful stigma associated with divorce. God&#39;s personal divorce is also used to delve into the dynamics of infidelity, for the specific purpose of removing the disorientation that always seems to follow a betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A framework of Seven Spiritual Secrets is used to display timeless truths, to both understand the past and to build a new future. The seven secrets of freedom, peace, reciprocity, fallenness, integrity, trust, and fulfillment will take the reader on a specifically scriptural journey into restoration after divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, each secret challenges some traditional viewpoints, while revealing unique and hidden outlooks. For example: Does God really hate divorce? Is unconditional love even scriptural? Is a perfect life even achievable? Are there boundaries to sacrificial love? Is it true that we can&#39;t trust anything in this world? And was marriage intended to be our highest fulfillment on earth? (If not, what is?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people, from ancient times until today, have embraced the truth of these timeless secrets as they walked through the pathways of their lives. So come and join them! It&#39;s the scriptural journey of peace, restoration, and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
