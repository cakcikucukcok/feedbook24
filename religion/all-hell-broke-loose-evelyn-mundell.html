  <title>All Hell Broke Loose - Evelyn Mundell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ANCIENT SECRETS REVEALED
	The delivery of a grubby package to Doctor Etienne Naude, a theologian and computer programmer, set an amazing chain of events in motion  one that defied all imagination. 
	The ensuing rollercoaster ride draws together a most unlikely team of most unlikely heroes. As they strive to unravel the puzzles, they uncover the secrets of a ten thousand year-old malignant, unspeakable Evil  an Evil far beyond any human comprehension  one that has pervaded the very fabric of every facet of human society, and is well on its way to achieve its goal  Total Earth Domination. 
They discover that the realties of the Biblical Deluge are a far cry from the commonly accepted stories. The conventional accounts do not even come close. The poignant, eye-witness account of what really happened is in total harmony with the scientific and historical facts at our disposal. The team is faced with the raw realities of Gods awesome anger as well as His amazing mercy, providence and love.
	The convoluted roller-coaster ride continues to build up velocity and draws in the combined efforts of the Israeli MOSSAD, British SAS, and American and South African security forces." />
