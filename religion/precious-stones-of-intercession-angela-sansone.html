  <title>Precious Stones of Intercession - Angela Sansone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gods desire is that every one of his brides be ready for Him to use them for the saving of many lives (Genesis 50:20).  We can only be ready for the Master to use us for every good work (2 Timothy 2:2021) by personally and corporately being cleansed and by faithfully interceding.  He is more than able to bring our enemies and strongholds to their knees so they fall but we rise up and stand firm (Psalm 20:68).  
The more God develops you in your prayer life, the more Psalm 55:18 will become true of your life.  And with every victory and every defeat, you will increasingly see that He has only begun to show us His greatness and the strength of His hand (Deuteronomy 3:24).  
In Precious Stones of Intercession, you will find clarity of purpose and strength to endure with:
	Stories of churches, leaders, and individuals who have overcome spiritual strongholds with specific, persistent prayer
	Examples of how to specifically pray for and over others without ceasing
	Inspiration from Gods Word as it continually calls us to walk and talk with Him in prayer
	Action steps for churches, leaders, families, and missionaries to practice intercessory prayer." />
