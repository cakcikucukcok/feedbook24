  <title>The Trouble with Islam - Irshad Manji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have to be honest with you. Islam is on very thin ice with me....Through our screaming self-pity and our conspicuous silences, we Muslims are conspiring against ourselves.  We&#39;re in crisis and we&#39;re dragging the rest of the world with us.  If ever there was a moment for an Islamic reformation, it&#39;s now.  For the love of God, what are we doing about it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In blunt, provocative, and deeply personal terms, Irshad Manji unearths the troubling cornerstones of mainstream Islam today: tribal insularity, deep-seated anti-Semitism, and an uncritical acceptance of the Koran as the final, and therefore superior, manifesto of God. In this open letter to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, Manji asks arresting questions. &quot;Who is the real colonizer of Muslims - America or Arabia? Why are we all being held hostage by what&#39;s happening between the Palestinians and the Israelis?  Why are we squandering the talents of women, fully half of God&#39;s creation?  What&#39;s our excuse for reading the Koran literally when it&#39;s so contradictory and ambiguous?  Is that a heart attack you&#39;re having?  Make it fast.  Because if more of us don&#39;t speak out against the imperialists within Islam, these guys will walk away with the show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manji offers a practical vision of how the United States and its allies can help Muslims undertake a reformation that empowers women, promotes respect for religious minorities, and fosters a competition of ideas. Her vision revives Islam&#39;s lost tradition of independent thinking. This book will inspire struggling Muslims worldwide to revisit the foundations of their faith. It will also compel non-Muslims to start posing the important questions without fear of being deemed &quot;racists.&quot;  In more ways than one, &lt;i&gt;The Trouble with Islam&lt;/i&gt; is a clarion call for a fatwa-free future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
