  <title>Preparation for Eternity with God - Rick Streight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our time is short on this earth. Jesus will soon be returning to take His children home  but are we ready? There are preparations we can make. The book you are holding is a story about fighting the good fight of faith and conquering it with Christs help. Gods Word says, My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. (Hosea 4:6) The Bible also says, The truth shall make you free  ye shall be free indeed. (John 8:32,36) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Rick Streight speaks heartto-heart with the reader about the realities of the Christian journey and the reward that is waiting for us. He also speaks about the dangers that surround us, the temptations we often struggle with, and how to overcome sin through Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asks a major question: Why hasnt Jesus come yet ? This book answers that important question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you spiritually homesick? God has made a plan that we may have  boldness in the day of Judgment. (1 John 4:17) Jesus depended totally on His Father for wisdom and power. If we depend on Jesus, we can receive that same power to live the Christian life maturely, with no short cutsthats Gods way! This book also provides answers as to how we can hasten Jesuss second coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we all prepare ourselves for the day of the Lord through in-depth study of His Word with much prayer. Ask God, How do I apply these things I am learning to my life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
