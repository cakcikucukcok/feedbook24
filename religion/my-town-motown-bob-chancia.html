  <title>My Town: Motown! - Bob Chancia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of one mans burden for the city he lived in and loved. Detroit, once Americas leading industrial city, falls with political corruption, racial intolerance, and its auto industrys refusal to change. Bob spearheads the partnering of his New York City church with an inner-city Detroit church, trusting Gods power to take one small step in revitalizing Detroit. This book may challenge you to trust God to raise you from your own struggles. 
Bob Chancia has accurately and passionately communicated the issues facing Detroit as well as the hope for Detroitthe Gospel of Jesus Christ  because Jesus is the only hope for Detroit and all men. Bob, a native New Yorker, loves Detroit as much as we native Detroiters. I couldnt put this book down! A must read!

Here is the account of a miracle touching two great cities. New Yorks Calvary Baptist Church, by joining with Detroits Citadel of Faith Covenant Church, has displayed the power and presence of Christ in helping bring a once great city back to vibrant life. Bob Chancia has beautifully and forcefully recounted this miracle that touches two cities.
