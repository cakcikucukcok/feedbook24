  <title>God I Am Hurting and I Want to Be Made Whole Again - Martha M. Boyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I look around day after day at the body of Christ as a whole, many members but one body of Christ, my spirit is grieved. Pastor, teacher, preacher, Christian leaderour leaders are becoming weary, and they are no longer walking in the strong faith they once walked in. Day after day, I am face-to-face with yet another weary, wounded believer who is willing to quit and give up rather than get to the secret of the matter at hand. 
	I have found myself teaching, preaching to another with a wounded, broken heart while my heart was bleeding worse than the one whom I was helping. I found depressionwhatever pressed you could name, I was connected to it. Just down and out, I could not even get out of bed for weeks at a time. All I wanted to do was to help others become healed of their wounded issues while I was covering up, still in fragments myself. I see so many wounded leaders in charge of so many souls who are hurting and needing Gods help to make them wholethey are hurting and wounded themselves. 
	A question of our covered-up, wounded heart that my spiritual radar tuned into is, whom do we as spiritual leaders turn to when we are wounded and bleeding from our issues? I hear over and over from spiritual leaders: whom do we talk to when we find ourselves, as Paul puts it, in trouble on every side, case down, perplexed, and even persecuted who do we turn to? What step or tools does a leader who shepherds over many souls have to use to express in daily life how not to feel distressed, despair, forsaken or destroyed? How can you and I as leaders help a wounded Christian in the need to be made whole when we ourselves are still in fragments: uncompleted, fragile, easily broken, broken in many pieces, not all together ourselves?
