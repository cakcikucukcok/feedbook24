  <title>Live 120 Years in Good Health - Stan Yonker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was in the plumbing and heating wholesale business for twenty-five years before going into the ministry at age thirty-seven. I was always a very positive person, and when I went into the ministry, I was shocked and deeply disturbed by how people talked about sickness and disease and death.
	The longer I was in the ministry, the more I became aware of the great gulf there was between Gods people and God in this whole area. I began to see clearly from the Bible what Gods Will was for his people. I began to preach and teach about healing and life. I began to minister healing to my people. I would lay hands on the sick and anoint with oil. I began to ask God to heal people. It was in the Bible, and Jesus did it, and He told us to do it, so I did it.
	Several people were healed and converted and delivered from Satan. Lives were changed by God, and I got more and more excited. But not everyone got excited. In fact, I ran into much resistance. I found that most Christians just did not believe in the Bible. They didnt believe God would heal them, and they certainly didnt believe in long life. Everyone believed that God took them or He taught people a lesson through sickness or accidents or death.
	So I found that I had to resign from the denomination in which I was a pastor. So I started a church in Fort Lauderdale, and I have continued to be strong in my faith concerning healing and long life. So over the years, with all the experiences Ive had and with the negative resistance that I have run up against, I have gathered much information and decided to write a book.
	I emphasize how negative and unbelieving we are and how we have developed such deep ruts in our thinking. How we blame God. How we base everything on the wrong standard. How our everyday language is a language of death. How we have so much doubt in God. It has made me so concerned.
	Only by the love of God flowing through me have I been able to keep my faith and continue to practice what I preach. I know it is Gods Will that I help others to see the truth. The truth is Jesus. The truth is Gods Word. We know Jesus was the revelation of God, what God was like. He was a healer, the greatest healer of all time. The Bible is Gods Word, and it tells us that God wants us well. It also tells us who the enemy is. Satan is the taker, and God is the giver.
	Live 120 Years in Good Health is full of Bible quotes revealing these truths and tells us how to overcome our doubts and weaknesses. Watch what we say, Possess your vessel, Establish your priority, The choice is yours, The importance of love, Standing firm, etc.
	This book has many Bible quotations. Thats because the Bible is Gods Word, containing His promises, His instructions, His will, His direction, etc. From the Bible, we learn Gods way. But we must DO it. We must be doers of the Word, not just hearers or readers (James 1:2225). The way to healing, health, and long life is Gods way. He is the giver of lifeHis life!
	My vision is that God will use this book to inform and inspire people to seek His Kingdom first and to discover the truth of not just healing, but long life120 years in good health. There is so much sickness and death and sorrow and tragedy. We need a change of direction. We need Gods Way. We need Jesus, the healer. We need help.
	As you read this book, I pray that you see the truth and find the way. Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I pray you find Jesus and live a healthy, happy, holy life with Him.
	One last thing, Jesus is coming soon. According to 2 Peter 3:12, we can hasten the day of the coming of the Lord. I believe we will hasten that day by being healthy and living long lives as a witness to the love and power of God. Jesus is coming for a glorious church (Ephesians 5:27). I invite you to accept this challenge and LIVE FOR 120 YEARS IN GOOD HEALTH to the glory of God.
