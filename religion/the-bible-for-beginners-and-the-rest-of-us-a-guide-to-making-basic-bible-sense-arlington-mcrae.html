  <title>The Bible For Beginners And The Rest of Us: A Guide to Making Basic Bible Sense - Arlington McRae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Paradigm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this new series - &lt;strong&gt;BIBLE THREADS, &lt;em&gt;Keys to Understanding the Bible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - award-winning author Arlington McRae offers us a fresh new 21st century paradigm for how we approach the Bible and understand its essential message. Not a new message; but a new perspective of the Bible as a whole to significantly increase our understanding of it. This series is an invaluable resource to guide us on our journey to truly comprehending the Bible and its applicability to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bible For Beginners And the Rest of Us&lt;/strong&gt;, the first volume in the series, offers us a power packed, Jesus inspired, potentially life-changing resource as it presents the Bible to us in its simplest form. Starting at the beginning, the author walks us through a new &amp;quot;perspective&amp;quot; and a new &amp;quot;context&amp;quot; for how we understand and interpret what we read. It is designed for (a) those of us new to the Bible, and (b) those who never received a comprehensive overview of the Bible that makes sense to them, that fills in the blanks. Additionally, in this volume, the author lays out the structure and the over all story - the big picture - of the Bible, to give us a broader context for how we interpret and unify the various books and stories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its purpose is to equip you to &amp;quot;discover Bible truths for yourself&amp;quot;. Therefore, at the completion of this volume, you will be encouraged to read your Bible and to study it more intelligently, with much more confidence, and with a satisfying sense of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This volume is published in two versions: &lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Expanded&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; . The Expanded Version includes the content of the Standard Version plus it adds an additional chapter and connects you to an extended library of relevant online resources to extend your biblical depth and comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Bible For Beginners And the Rest of Us &lt;/strong&gt;is not just for beginners but also for those who never started at the beginning.What do I mean? Do you remember when you became a Christian? Did anyone guide you through the Bible story, in an orderly fashion, from the beginning to end? Do you have a systematic and logical understanding of the Bible&amp;#39;s message? If not, this book is for you. Read it. Digest it. Then apply it as you read your Bible from cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Remember to A.S.K. (Ask, Seek, Knock, Matthew 7:7-8) the Holy Spirit to teach you as you read. And please, do not forget togive Him thanks and praise daily for what He teaches you. And as always, all the glory belongs to God, the Father, and to His Son, Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;May you enjoy it as much as I have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Arlington McRae&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
