  <title>Backpacking Through the Anglican Communion: A Search for Unity - Jesse Zink</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• A fresh first-hand take on the Anglican Communion  • Of special interest to younger Episcopalians/Anglicans  Travel with Jesse Zink as he literally walks us through many of church&#39;s most representative provinces-Nigeria, front line of opposition to the American church; South Sudan, leading the way to a peaceful future; England, the mother church, facing an uncertain future; South Africa, once led by an iconic archbishop and now fighting a devastating AIDS epidemic; and the United States, divided and dwindling, but with hopeful signs of new growth.  The backpacking author has a story to tell that is far different from the one that dominates the headlines. He reveals that when debates about power, history, and sexuality are undertaken in a spirit of mutuality and trust, they can serve to strengthen, not weaken, the Communion. The result is a book that vividly presents slices of local Anglican life around the world, argues convincingly that unity is central to the Communion&#39;s mission, and presents a credible path to achieving global unity." />
