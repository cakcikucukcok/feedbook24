  <title>Praying for Miracles: Exploring the Rational and Biblical Basis for Believing in a Wonder-Working God - Courtney Daniel Dabney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miracles are woven into the fabric of Christianity. From Genesis to Revelation, they are threads that run throughout the entire tapestry of Scripture. It seems, however, that our society has waged an all-out assault on miracles and their relevance. Today, biblical miracles are brushed aside as mere superstition or myth, while God is dismissed as unnecessary. Is there really a wonder-working God?  Prayer is a powerful thing. It is a two-way conversation between a holy God and those He has chosen to redeem. Prayer is not powerful because of the words we choose, nor based upon the amount of faith that we possess, but because we serve an awesome God who is able to step into our natural world and work miracles on our behalf. So, the question is not whether there is a God, but rather how big is your God? Our faith is literally stitched together by God&#39;s miraculous power." />

    	<p>Miracles are woven into the fabric of Christianity. From Genesis to Revelation, they are threads that run throughout the entire tapestry of Scripture. It seems, however, that our society has waged an all-out assault on miracles and their relevance. Today, biblical miracles are brushed aside as mere superstition or myth, while God is dismissed as unnecessary. Is there really a wonder-working God? Prayer is a powerful thing. It is a two-way conversation between a holy God and those He has chosen to redeem. Prayer is not powerful because of the words we choose, nor based upon the amount of faith that we possess, but because we serve an awesome God who is able to step into our natural world and work miracles on our behalf. So, the question is not whether there is a God, but rather how big is your God? Our faith is literally stitched together by God's miraculous power.</p>
