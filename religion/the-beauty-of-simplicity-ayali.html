  <title>The Beauty of Simplicity - ayali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day one ceases to wait 
Is the day one actually begins to truly live.
Any reason is an excuse for him or her to keep waiting.
It is what it is; the truth is uncompromising.
Therefore, my advice to you is: stop waiting!
Stop waiting for your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your spouse, the right job, the proper friends, or anything else in order for your life to move forward in the direction you desire. 
You alone are here for yourself. 
There is no one else. 
There is a sense of safety among family, friends, and children; a real safety can only be found within oneself. 
In order to arrive, one must behave as though he or she is there
Meaning one must be the very same thing one aspires to be, thus turning into oneself. 
Any which way one chooses is always in accordance with and based on what he or she understood and learned during his or her life until this momentthe moment of reading these lines.
Therefore, as long as ones comprehension and development increase, they allow ones growth, and with it more options to act in ones own way. 
Much beyond the words one uses: Thats who I am, which cause the exact opposite from development.  
In the path of growth, at a certain point, one will realize that one can actually be almost anything one chooses, and hence should now select the path he or she truly desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who know, I have no words to say.
For those who dont know, I have the world to give.&lt;/p&gt;" />
