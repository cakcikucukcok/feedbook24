  <title>God Cares for You - Margaret Ann Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the age of eight I was sexually abused several times by a female baby sitter. At the age of 33 I asked GOD to forgive my abuser and save her if she was still living. I forgave her at that time, too. Subsequently, for the first time I told my sister about this experience. I grew up hating women until I forgave my abuser. I have never had a lesbian experience outside of being sexually abused. My life had many scars from being sexually abused and I thank GOD for healing those wounds. I can&#39;t say that I have been completely delivered from the effects of being sexually abused but I am a better person. I thank GOD also that my identity as a woman was not altered because of being abused.&lt;/p&gt;
