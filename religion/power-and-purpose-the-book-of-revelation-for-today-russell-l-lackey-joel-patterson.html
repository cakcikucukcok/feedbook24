  <title>Power and Purpose: The Book of Revelation for Today - Russell L. Lackey, Joel Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book of Revelation is confusing to read. Images of beasts, trumpets, plagues, and even dragons fill its pages. In his book, Power and Purpose, Russ Lackey guides readers on an adventure through the harrowing pages of Revelation in a clear and accessible way. Along the journey, issues such as economic and political injustice, ecology, evangelism, and synthesizing faith with everyday life are raised with the hope of Christ woven throughout. The main question of the book is not how does a person escape this world, rather, who is the Lord of this world? Christians who pick up Revelation with this question in mind do not try to escape society, rather, they work to reform it. Doing this they discover that true power and purpose comes from Christ, the Lamb who was slain. This is a must read for anyone desiring to better understand the book of Revelation." />
