  <title>We Are the Church … Let&#39;s Act Like It - Linda Tower Pevey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many people think the church has become a social club with little impact on the world. That is not God&#39;s plan for the church. &lt;em&gt;We Are the Church &amp;hellip; Let&#39;s Act Like It&lt;/em&gt; takes readers through the book of Acts, looking at what it means to be the church of Jesus Christ, the world-changing church that Jesus intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems in the church are nothing new. The book of Acts is full of them. In &lt;em&gt;We Are the Church &amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; Linda Tower Pevey offers the church practical and biblical ways to live out its mandate to be a church that positively impacts its community and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are the Church &amp;hellip; Let&#39;s Act Like It&lt;/em&gt; is a 7-week study that helps readers see the biblical vision for the church and a vision for what the church can be today. In it, Pevey offers encouragement that the church can truly be a transformative presence in the world, just as the early church was in the book of Acts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
