  <title>Little Johnny&#39;s Faith Adventures - Jacqui Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Little Johnnys Faith Adventures: Our Beginnings is the first in a series of books that teaches children foundational biblical principles using everyday life situations and interactive lessons. My goal is to help parents and bible study teachers teach Gods word to children ages seven and below in a fun and creative manner. This book contains four stories about the daily adventures of Little Johnny followed by five bible study lessons, which can be taught in a classroom setting. Parents or teachers have the option of simply reading the stories about Little Johnny or teaching the lessons that little Johnny has learned. However, the two may be combined to get the most out of the book. Proverbs 22:6 says, Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. As a parent or teacher, this is the best investment you can ever make in a childs life. So, join Little Johnny today as he learns about Gods Word. The stories and lessons in this book are based upon Genesis 1-4.
