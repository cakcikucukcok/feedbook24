  <title>Quest for Meaning Through an Intimate Walk with God - H. Baté Agbor-Baiyee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Quest for Meaning through an intimate walk with God is about divine empowerment and spiritual awakening through the incalculable possibilities of prayers and relationship with God. This book underscores the fact that nothing is too immense or trifling to be a theme or subject of prayer. Though prayer is central in vitalizing our existence, all too often, it is not understood, ignored, or avoided. In our deepest valley of despair and despondency, Jesus notices our tears and sufferings; He knows the full magnitude of our aches and has reassured us that He will not leave us to our own stratagem. All He asks of us is to invite Him to dwell in us, the temple of God. There is something simply prophetic and powerful about a heart which even in disillusionment is willing to look up to God in praise and worship as the case is for many despairing African and immigrant children. They struggle with doubt and wrestle with anxiety and discouragements, especially when their prayers go unanswered while lost in the gorge of the shadow. Yet, they have undertaken to categorically love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with your entire mind. This is a bare-knuckled collection of stimulating and liberating prayers that addresses a broad expanse of existential issues faced by fearless African children in their fragile stations in life. They are passionately praying like Paul asking Father-God the good Shepherd for direction and protection. Although the fear in their eyes and angst in their souls have transformed into futility, their hearts do not panic because they know no satanic weapon formed against them shall flourish. They are assured through prayers that they are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus the enthroned Creator. Quest for Meaning proffers assuring prayers that serve as tonic to cool-off the penury, effrontery and tormenting experiences of the afflicted. Be anxious of nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:6-7" />
