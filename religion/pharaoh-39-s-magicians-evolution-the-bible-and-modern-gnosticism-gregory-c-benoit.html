  <title>Pharaoh&#39;s Magicians: Evolution, the Bible, and Modern Gnosticism - Gregory C. Benoit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ancient heresy of Gnosticism has seeped into the church and is being taught in our most influential seminaries today. This can be seen most readily in the willingness-and even determination-of leading scholars and theologians to force the doctrines of evolution into the sacred text of the Scriptures. This book looks closely at the Bible to determine whether or not evolution can be endorsed by the Word of God. It then moves on to examine how today&#39;s theologians have played tricks with the text in order to seduce ordinary Christians into embracing Gnosticism. This book is a call to God&#39;s people to eradicate this heresy and return to an honest reading of the Bible. These &#39;higher critics&#39; have castrated Christianity; they themselves are spiritual eunuchs, incapable of producing any spiritual seed with which to grow the church in the coming generations. They hope to bring some reconciliation between the teachings of modern science and the traditional teachings of Scripture, but instead they only serve to instill doubt in the ordinary Christian-doubt that an ordinary believer can ever again trust his own uneducated reading of the Bible. It is sad to think that William Tyndale was martyred for bringing the Bible to the common man, while modern theologians are being praised for taking it away again." />
