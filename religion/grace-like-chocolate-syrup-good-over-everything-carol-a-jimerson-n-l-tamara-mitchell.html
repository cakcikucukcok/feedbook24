  <title>Grace Like Chocolate Syrup: Good over Everything - Carol A. Jimerson, N. L. Tamara Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyday lifewe all have one. We all are living our everyday life. But there is living your everyday life, and then there is living life every day knowing in your heart and soul that everything in your life is good, even the things that others may not think are good. Everyday life can be good when you are in trusting-God-fully mode. You trust him with all that your life is about. You trust him with everything that is in your life and in the lives around you. You trust in his sovereignty and that he knows and has his best for you, and you want it all the time, so you reach out and grasp it and grip it because you do not want to let go of it. You may think your life is good but deep, deep down there is something missing or lacking and you just cant seem to put your finger on it. There is only one way to find out and that is going all-in for Jesus. After all, he is all-in for you as he went all out for you on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;" />
