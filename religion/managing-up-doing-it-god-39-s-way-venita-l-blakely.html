  <title>Managing Up: Doing It God&#39;s Way - Venita L. Blakely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Managing Up: Doing It Gods Way came about as Venita was seeking ways to improve her work performance.  Not only did her research and private study time result in the writing of this book, it also brought out that her foundational Scripture for her work performance was already intertwined in this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing Up: Doing It Gods Way will not only benefit the office assistant but any person in the workforce, because it emphasizes how a personal relationship with Jesus Christ can and will influence your work performance.  The process is from the inside out, not the outside inward.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how an intimate relationship with Christ influences your work performance, every assistant and employee will gain an understanding of how promotion will always come during the course of their career and the fact that they can never be without employment.  They follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
