  <title>God Is Well Pleased with You - Teresa Goree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is God really like? When He looks at you, what do you think He sees? What does He really think about you? If youve ever asked yourself these questions, then this book will unfold the genuine heart of God towards you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God Is Well Pleased With You, Teresa Goree reveals Gods greatest purpose and intention is that you would truly know Him and His immense heart of love for you. Life was meant to be lived out of an intimate relationship with your creator in the certainty that He is passionately in love with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His personal view toward you is kind and gracious, regardless of what you have or have not done. You were created to be loved by your maker. It is the highest order of love a person can experience and it is the only love that will impart the highest sense of value and worth to your life. If your perception of God is unclear about how He truly sees you, your life experiences will be limited and far less than you were designed for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether youre a believer or nonbeliever, let this book uncover the true nature and heart of the one who knows you better than you know yourself and lift you to a place of honor, significance and purpose that far exceeds anything you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
