  <title>The Twin Towers Trilogy - Sal Umana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;    Sal Umana is a psychotherapist and minister who directed a counseling center in New York City for the past thirty years. After the attack on the World trade Center on 9/11/01, Sal imagines God coming to him and asking who was the God everyone was talking about? God is very upset because He is not the God of the Al Quaeda suicide bombers, nor is he the God of the President&#39;s &quot;Infinite Justice&quot; in whose name George Bush &quot;declares war on terrorism.&quot; (?!?)
    Sal, the therapist, spends four months in weekly therapy sessions in which it turns out that the God we all grew up with never really existed. Instead, God turns out to be the Eternal Spirit of Love, and not the Tribal Imperialist God of domination and vengeance of traditional religions. This became the first book of the trilogy, &quot;The Day God Died&quot;, and was published in 2002.
    Since God was no longer the Almighty Big Person with an Omnipotent Ego, what was Sal doing with an Ego? So he did another course of therapy/self-analysis, called &quot;The Day My Ego Died&quot;. Sal comes to the realization that we are not individual Egos, but part of the Oneness of Being, including God, ourselves, and all of reality. This is Zen, existential psychotherapy, Christian mysticism, and Buddhist Awakening all blended together.
Finally, for the tenth anniversary of 9/11/01, Sal completes his Trilogy with &quot;Back To Earth/ A Spirituality For the Age of Terrorism.&quot; In this third book, Sal teaches us the difference between &quot;I &quot; and &quot;we,&quot; Ego and Love, life and death, and time and eternity.
In these three volumes, Sal dispenses a lifetime of learning from psychotherapy, meditation, and ministry that can help the reader negotiate the anxiety of the age of terrorism.&quot;" />
