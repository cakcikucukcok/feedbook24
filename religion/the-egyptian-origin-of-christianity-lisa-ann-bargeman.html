  <title>The Egyptian Origin of Christianity - Lisa Ann Bargeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A breakthrough book affecting the scientific, religious and literary communities, &lt;b&gt;The Egyptian Origin of Christianity&lt;/b&gt; is a comprehensive look at the history of religion through the Literary Canon. As a culmination of years of research, this book fills the gaps between modern and ancient religious thought, providing us with the most valuable view of the Egyptian religion to date when compared with the The Bible and other classic literature. No other book has explored so well the origins of modern theology. This is done not only in terms of language, but also in terms of education, cosmology, physical symbolism and tradition. 
&lt;P&gt;As the first book to, in a scientific sound way, challenge the ecumenical system, &lt;b&gt;The Egyptian Origin of Christianity&lt;/b&gt; represents the fulfillment of strategy that calls for a comprehensive shift in the way religion is presently understood.

&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;I must admit that your ideas are very interesting, more fascinating [than I had anticipated.] I have read it with great interest. You illustrate your ideas [with] the Egyptian texts. &lt;B&gt;The Egyptian Origin of Christianity&lt;/B&gt; can fill &#39;the scientific hole&#39; in this problem.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Dr. Roman Szmurlo&lt;/B&gt; - PhD and Professor of Ancient Theology and Coptic Language at Warsaw University
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Lisa Ann Bargeman&#39;s &lt;B&gt;The Egyptian Origin Of Christianity&lt;/B&gt; offers an informative, iconoclastic analytical survey of those non-Biblical contributions to the concepts and ecumenical development of Christianity drawn from the Egyptian religious myths and rituals of antiquity. The juxtaposing of texts from the Bible and from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the comparison of similarities between the story of Osiris and the story of Jesus, the observations of cosmology, physical symbolism, and tradition, are all revealed in startling and unexpected ways that will give serious students of both Egyptian and Christian metaphysics a great deal of food for thought and reflection. Lisa Bargeman adheres to a very high standard of scholarship both in her presentation and in her interpretative commentary. The Egyptian Origin Of Christianity is a welcome and much appreciated contribution to Metaphysical Studies.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
