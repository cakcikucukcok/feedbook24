  <title>A Red Sea of Red Tape - Larry Vandeventer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Red Sea of Red Tape suggests how Bible events might have transpired differently in the 21st Century because of rules, laws, codes and the mindset that we have.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover how Moses is confronted by the Bureaucracy of the Red Sea Governmental Center for Travel, Tourism, Conventions and Hospitality.  They throw up road blocks as he struggles to justify trekking across the Red Sea from Egypt to Sinai to escape Pharaohs army. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join hands with Noah in his verbal and legal debate with the Planning Commission  as he tries to convince them of the need to build an ark.  The council counters his every argument with a law or code that thwarts him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how the ABC Beverage Commission shuts down the wedding feast of Cana because the wine produced and consumed there is not produced, packaged and taxed by the ABC.  And the children present preclude consuming on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vandeventer takes a thoughtful journey through Biblical events to demonstrate the difference in thinking from then to now.  Ride along and be amazed how we are different. &lt;/p&gt;" />
