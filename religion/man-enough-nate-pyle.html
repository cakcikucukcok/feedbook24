  <title>Man Enough - Nate Pyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man Enough&lt;/em&gt; challenges the idea that there is one way to be a man. The masculinity that pervades our church and culture often demands that men conform to a macho ideal, leaving many men feeling ashamed that they&amp;rsquo;re not living up to God&amp;rsquo;s plan for them. Nate uses his own story of not feeling &amp;ldquo;man enough&amp;rdquo;, as well as sociological and historical reflections, to help men see that manhood isn&amp;rsquo;t about what you do, but who you are. It&amp;rsquo;s not about the size of your paycheck, your athletic ability, or your competitive spirit. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to fit any masculine stereotype to be a real man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;In our culture and churches more thoughtful, quieter, or compassionate personalities, as well as stay-at-home dads, are often looked down upon; and sermons, conferences, and publications center on helping men become &amp;ldquo;real men&amp;rdquo;. This pressure to have one&amp;rsquo;s manhood validated is antithetical to Gospel living and negatively affects how men relate to each other, to women and children, and to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man Enough&lt;/em&gt; roots men in the Gospel, examines biblical examples of masculinity that challenge the idea of a singular type of man, and ultimately encourages men to conform to the image of Jesus&amp;mdash;freeing men up to be who they were created to be: a son of God who uniquely bears His image.&lt;/p&gt;" />
