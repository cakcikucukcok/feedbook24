  <title>The Story of the Book - Terence Copley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who wrote the Bible? Where did the titles of the separate books come from? How is the Bible used in modern society? Why are new translations still being made? What do young people think of the Bible? Who decided what was put into the Bible? These questions and more are answered in this easy-to-understand description of the Bible.
Wherever the Bible is used, questions arise about what it is and how it got there. The story of how a collection of scrolls written over many centuries came to make such an impact on the world provides a challenging subject for exploration. In his unique, refreshing style Terence Copley addresses over fifty of the most common questions asked about how the Bible came together, reached its users and is valued today. 
Essential reading for teachers and students of theology as well as anyone who uses the Bible in a church situation or is simply interested in the Bible. An easy to understand style that&#39;s simple to navigate, with questions for group discussion and personal investigation." />
