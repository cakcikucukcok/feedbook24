  <title>Was the Birth of Jesus According to Scripture? - Steve Moyise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each Christmas, the birth of Jesus is celebrated through carols, Bible readings, and nativity plays. The angelic announcements to Mary and Elizabeth, Jesus&#39; birth in a manger, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh are some of the best-known stories in the Bible. But did they really happen? And were they predicted by Israel&#39;s prophets, as the Bible claims? Steve Moyise suggests that the clue to answering these questions is to understand how Israel&#39;s Scriptures were being interpreted in Jesus&#39; day. Was Isaiah thinking of a virgin birth when he uttered his famous prophecy (Isa 7:14), or is that a later Christian interpretation? Was there a star that led the magi to Bethlehem or should the story be taken symbolically? These and other questions are fully explored and the results are sometimes surprising." />
