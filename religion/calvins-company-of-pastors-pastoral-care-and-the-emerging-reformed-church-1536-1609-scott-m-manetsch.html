  <title>Calvins Company of Pastors: Pastoral Care and the Emerging Reformed Church, 1536-1609 - Scott M. Manetsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Calvins Company of Pastors, Scott Manetsch examines the pastoral theology and practical ministry activities of Genevas reformed ministers from the time of Calvins arrival in Geneva until the beginning of the seventeenth century. During these seven decades, more than 130 men were enrolled in Genevas Venerable Company of Pastors (as it was called), including notable reformed leaders such as Pierre Viret, Theodore Beza, Simon Goulart, Lambert Daneau, and Jean Diodati. Aside from these better-known epigones, Genevas pastors from this period remain hidden from view, cloaked in Calvins long shadow, even though they played a strategic role in preserving and reshaping Calvins pastoral legacy.  Making extensive use of archival materials, published sermons, catechisms, prayer books, personal correspondence, and theological writings, Manetsch offers an engaging and vivid portrait of pastoral life in sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Geneva, exploring the manner in which Genevas ministers conceived of their pastoral office and performed their daily responsibilities of preaching, public worship, moral discipline, catechesis, administering the sacraments, and pastoral care. Manetsch demonstrates that Calvin and his colleagues were much more than ivory tower theologians or quasi-agents of the state, concerned primarily with dispensing theological information to their congregations or enforcing magisterial authority. Rather, they saw themselves as spiritual shepherds of Christs Church, and this self-understanding shaped to a significant degree their daily work as pastors and preachers." />
