  <title>The Vows - Mary Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Vows draws upon traditional Christian teachings on the holiness of the marriage promises between a man and a woman. It explains how they may pledge to one another their commitments to a permanent, trusting, and family-oriented relationship. Mary Robinson illustrates the challenges and joys of such vows with impressions drawn from her own life, insights gleaned from contemporary church leaders and authors, and inspiration drawn from the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning chapters of &lt;i&gt;The Vows&lt;/i&gt; address the spiritual realities embedded in the phrases of the traditional marriage vow, showing how they capture the ups and downs of married life and sketch out a faithful response to those times. Later chapters turn their attention to the challenges that traditional marriage faces in modern society. Throughout, the author offers encouragement and exhortation that focus on helping the married couple remain committed to one another in the bond they had made before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find the life-altering nature of marriage vows presents you with challenges and leads you to ask questions about Christian teachings. If so, then Robinsons book will guide you on a journey through the meaning of the vows, give you a treasury of support from Christian leaders, and present you with a compendium of the Scriptures encouragement. When you finish reading this book you will have gained a clear understanding of the Christian ideals and aspirations for married life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
