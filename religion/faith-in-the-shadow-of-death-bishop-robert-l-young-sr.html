  <title>Faith in the Shadow of Death - Bishop Robert L. Young Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith in the Shadow of Death is a  book about my divine experience as I lived through the painful diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, a terminal lung disease. The book consists of ten chapters describing some of the hardships that I encountered, along with the unscheduled changes in my life, many that turned me and my wifes lives upside down. 
The book discusses some of the losses I experienced and how those losses affected my life, along with the divine lessons I learned as I lived with this crippling lung disease. The book gives the reader a fresh look and understanding at the meaning of faith and how God develops faith in the believer during times of extraordinary adversity. It discusses the relationship between faith and affliction, Satans tactics to destroy faith during times of affliction, and how God sets the atmosphere for faith to be developed in the believer.
The book closes with how I decided to no longer take prescribed medication for my lung disease for several months, instead completely trusting God for my healing and allowing God to comfort me as I endure the affliction of only 43 percent of my lungs functioning on a daily basis." />
