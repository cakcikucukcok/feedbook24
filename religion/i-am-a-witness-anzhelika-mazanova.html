She was raised by her grandmother, a very religious woman, but Anzelika did not share her grandmas faith. Even so, when she became an adult, things started happening in her life that slowly turned her into a firm believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anzelika describes events from her life exactly as they happenedevents in which she witnessed Gods helping hand. Some were joyous, and some were very sad. She talks about her childhood, her first job, her struggle in Russia, her arrival to the States, and her beginnings in the new land without a family, without knowing the English language, and with only $300 in her pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anzelika believes God truly exists and invites you to read this story in hopes that you will find your own connection with God. She is convinced you will encounter many of His miracles once that connection is established.&lt;/p&gt;" />
