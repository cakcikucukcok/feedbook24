  <title>The Eucharist in the New Testament and the Early Church - Eugene  LaVerdiere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As presented in the New Testament, the Eucharist is a source of both inspiration and guidance today. In &lt;i&gt;The Eucharist in the New Testament and the Ealy Church&lt;/i&gt;, Father LaVerdiere examines what the New Testament tells us about the Eucharist and how the Eucharist provides an important experiential and theological resource for thegospel stories of Jesus&#39; life, ministry, passion and resurrection, as well as for the life and development of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father LaVerdiere illustrates how the origins of the Eucharist coincide with the origins of the Church. The development of the Eucharist reflects the development of the ealy Church, as well as its creative theological and pastoral reflection. Through the lens of the New Testament it views the beginnings of both Church and Eucharist when the risen Lord appeared to the disciples at meals soon after Jesus&#39; passion, death and resurrection. He also looks beyond the New Testament and explores theongoing development of Eucharistic theology and practice up to the mid-second century, ending with Justin Martyr, the first to describe the Eucharist to people who had no personal experience of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father LaVerdiere focuses on the Eucharist in relation to ecclesiology, Christology, and liturgy. He begins by reflecting on how Christians referred to the Eucharist before it had a name, how names for the Eucharist came to be and their importance, how the Eucharist was celebrated at the very beginning, how liturgical formulas came to be, how these formulas brought out the riches of the Eucharist, and how the Eucharist related to different pastoral situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of triunity&quot; the assembly, the Eucharist, and the Church guides this study. The Eucharist is the sacrament of the assembly, the sacrament of the Church&#39;s life in the world. From the very beginning, there was no separating the three, nor are there separating references to the Eucharist from the letters, gospels, or other work in which the three appear. Here, FatherLaVerdiere stresses that in order to know the Eucharist in the New Testament and the ealy Church, one has only tolook at the composition and actual life of the Church. Thus, to know the Church, one has only to look at the way it celebrates the Eucharist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since most of today&#39;s chalenges concerning the Eucharist are similar to those experienced by the ealy Church, &lt;i&gt;The Eucharist in the New Testament and the Ealy Church&lt;/i&gt; will be of greathelp to pastors, students, catechists and those inministry, who want the celebration of the Eucharist to make a difference on the rest of Christian life in the Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eugene LaVerdiere, SSS, is the senior editor of &lt;/i&gt;Emmanuel &lt;i&gt;magazine and an adjunct professor of New Testament studies at Catholic Theological Union and Mundelein Seminary in Chicago. He is author of &lt;/i&gt; Fundamentalism: A Pastoral Concern, A Church for al Peoples: Missionary Issues in a World Church,&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;Luke from the New Testament Message &lt;i&gt; seriespublished by The Liturgical Press.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
