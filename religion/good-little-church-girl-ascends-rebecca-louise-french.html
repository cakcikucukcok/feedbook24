  <title>Good Little Church Girl Ascends - Rebecca Louise French</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rebecca has been a good little church girl for most of her life, since her mother brought her into the church at age five. Being socially awkward and somewhat of a misfit within society, she found refuge in the church and a place where she thought people accepted her for who she was- a place she could be &amp;ldquo;herself&amp;rdquo;. However, as the years passed, something deep inside her didn&amp;rsquo;t feel quite right. The quiet unrest she felt churning within her stomach became harder to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Searching for answers to the questions within was not always easy and with suicidal thoughts and being sexually assaulted, at times it was it was quite harrowing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However there always seemed to be an angel beside Rebecca gently guiding her, lighting the way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Join Rebecca as she shares her incredible life story of how she made the gradual and life changing decision to move from religion to spirituality. Learn how this one woman was able to find joy, love, peace, self-acceptance and most importantly, the truth within.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note, this book is not about condemning or judging organized religion or the people therein.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those who are unsure, confused or bitter about the religion you are a part of or were once a part of, this book is most certainly for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been a part of a religious body and you are simply searching for answers on your own life journey, this book is also for you as you discover your truth within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Author&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rebecca Louise French is an Intuitive Healer, Coach and Author. She assists clients around the world not only to heal, but to connect with their own inner knowing. With a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Psychology and a Diploma of Education, she combines her unique blend of scientific background and over 10 years as a classroom teacher with her expertise in Reiki, crystal and energy healing, angel communication, metaphysics and life coaching. Gentle compassion and a grounded calmness characterize her work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She has appeared in international telesummits and continues to participate in speaking engagements in both personal development and spiritual fields.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those who seek assistance from Rebecca thank her for the acuity of her insight, her detailed suggestions for moving forward, and the peace, clarity and lightness of heart they feel after a session with her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rebecca assists people of all ages and backgrounds and is especially passionate about helping women and those who have left organized religion. She has expertise in supporting women who, like herself, have experienced abuse and/or depression. She is also committed to empowering anyone who has made the decision to move away from religion and is looking for support in finding who they really are when the confines of the church fall away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the creator of the life changing &amp;ldquo;A Year of Healing- Year 1 and 2&amp;rdquo; channeled meditation e-courses and the &amp;ldquo;Finding the Truth Within&amp;rdquo; religious recovery e-course, Rebecca welcomes you to delve deeper at www.rebeccalfrench.com&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Born in Canada, Rebecca has oscillated between living in Canada, England and Australia for most of her life. She has now, hopefully, settled in Canada once and for all. She resides just off the west coast of Canada, enjoying the island lifestyle with her Aussie husband and two awesome sons. They hope to add to the family soon, in the form of a furry family member.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
