  <title>The God Dilemma - V.C. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Todays modern technology and scientific knowledge contradicts all religious dogma created in ancient times by ignorant and superstitious people who had just learned to write. Modern science can test the strength of ones faith and it can make him a skeptic, causing him to discard the religious beliefs of his family for generations past. Deep religious experiences (or self-induced delusions) can be explained by physical, psychological, biological and medical sciences today. Evil or Sin is the result of social and mental conditions and can be corrected with education and medication today and without the help of an imaginary God.  To quote Mark Twain Faith is to believe in what you know for sure is not true. 
The GOD Dilemma is an unscientific investigation to justify believing in religion today and in particular the Christian faith. It argues that scientific and logical discussions about religion and the existence of God are futile; however, we cannot stop thinking about it.  Humans are (maybe) born with a faith in Gods existence and with a conscience that tells them which is morally and ethically right and which is not.  Author Thomas used to believe in religion, God, and Christianity through his teenage years, but even if he learned to ignore it during his 50 adult years, he never consciously discarded his Christian faith. He now shares his investigations and attempts to believe in Jesus Christ once again, despite todays knowledge of the universe and evolution and by ignoring the sanctimonious behavior of fundamentalist US Christians.
In the international scene, Thomas believes that the US wars since WWII cannot be justified by the life and the teachings of Jesus Christ. There is an underlying moral claim by fundamentalist Christian Americans that its actions are justified by Jesus and Christianity. The new phenomenon called Christian Zionism which requires the removal of Palestinians from their homeland to create and expand Israel to enable the second coming of Christ, categorically contradicts the teachings of Jesus in the four Gospels. Zionism is based on the Old Testament Bible (OTB) and Revelations in the New Testament both of which are scientifically ridiculous. The OTB is also historically questionable (about a God interacting with his only chosen people in Middle East) and morally criminal (God sponsored and assisted armed robbery and genocide to create Israel  ancient and modern) by todays legal and ethical standards.
Why has the life and teachings of Jesus Christ not produced universal love and non-violence among Christians? Why are American Christians the most active supporters of (or not speaking out against) the wars, bombing and destruction by the USA since WWII?  Are Ashkenazi European Jews really the descendants of Semitic slaves from Egypt?  What were the reasons for anti-Semitism and the Holocaust in Christian Europe of the past?  Why is the European Union and the US punishing the Palestinians for the Holocaust crimes in Europe?  Can Gods orders in the Bible be legally used by the United Nations to recreate Israel again in the 20th century after 3000 years by getting rid of Palestinians?   
The book seeks to inform and provoke critical thinking of the readers through this investigation into religion and God and, in particular, the violent, intolerant and self-righteous behavior of Christians for centuries past and even in todays enlightened age using the source of the Christian religion  the Bible." />
