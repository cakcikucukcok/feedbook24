  <title>Choosing End of Life Nursing - Susan Bardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;SPAN STYLE= &quot;&quot; &gt;&amp;lsquo;Death is inevitable&amp;mdash;none of us will escape it. Ending life with a terminal illness is a slow and rather lonely process. I am interested in the question of why some nurses choose to work in the field of palliative care. I am one who willingly stepped into the role of being with patients at their most vulnerable time &amp;mdash;when death became inevitable.&lt;BR&gt; My nursing history has spanned fifty years, of which the last twenty were in palliative care of terminally ill and dying patients. What was it that influenced me to move from a curing model to comfort caring only?&lt;BR&gt; My work is an account of how I discovered palliative care nursing after thirty years in the acute-care setting. I migrated to Australia at the age of seventeen after the violence of World War II and the death of my father in a refugee camp. It seemed that taking on nursing was the best way to settle into a new life. I was happy with general nursing but had a feeling that there was more I could contribute to my patient care. My mother&amp;rsquo;s unexpected death with cancer was responsible for showing the way. She died in the hospice unit of the hospital where I was employed. Sitting by her side showed me another aspect of nursing that attracted me to a career change. I transferred to the Hospice after mother died and remained there for twenty years. Naturally I wondered why this change of direction happened.&amp;rsquo; - Susan Bardy&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
