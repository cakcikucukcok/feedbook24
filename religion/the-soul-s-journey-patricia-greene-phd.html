  <title>The Soul’S Journey - Patricia Greene PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Souls Journey&lt;/i&gt; is a desirable book for the soul journeyer who has begun his or her spiritual quest. It was written with respect of &lt;i&gt;The Interior Castle&lt;/i&gt;, the monumental work written by Teresa of Avila, whose writing is the wellspring that has quenched the thirst of many. It is the foundation from which all other sources have flowedtranslations, meditations, and now this brief book that offers insight from seven reflections.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reflections and landmarks are made by the author on the mansions of &lt;i&gt;The Interior Castle&lt;/i&gt; for those who seek to engage in the transformational process of their spiritual pilgrimages. Glimpses are thus caught of the souls journey throughout the interior mansions. Facets of the journey are reflected to engage within the wisdom of Teresas writing that can never be replicated.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The intention is for the soul journeyer to grow in the wholeness of mind, body, and soul, as well as in ones own humanness as he or she engages with the rawness of the soul to refine that rawness, to become authentic, and to realize his or her full potential in that search for the divine one within.&lt;/P&gt;" />
