  <title>Blessed Adventure - Dean Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Beatitudes from Jesuss Sermon on the Mount are the basis of living Gods way. In fact, they are a fundamental part of being and becoming a Christian; when followed, they can create a closer walk with Jesus Christ.
&lt;i&gt;Blessed Adventure&lt;/i&gt; is author Dean Duncans refreshing perspective on how the Beatitudes play a significant role in our Christian life. Found in the book of Matthew, the Beatitudes offer a pathway to spiritual development and contain nine blessings for Christians. These blessings are not archaic, but pertain to the here and now and are beneficial for all followers of Christ.
Duncan examines each beatitude and shows how they can be achieved only through Jesus himselfnot on our own volition. He shows the unique relationship between the Gospel message and the Beatitudes, pointing out how they support each other and intertwine in such a way as to enrich the understanding of each. In addition, Duncans thoughtful interpretation encourages believers to dig deeper into Scripture and forge an unbreakable bond with the Lord.
