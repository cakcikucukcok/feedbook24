  <title>Consider the Stars - John Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Consider the Stars will not only be a delight to read, it will be a valued experience to be shared over and over again. Whether you make reading the seasonal stories a tradition or use its lessons to supplement your Bible study, church service or simply entertain your youth group, Consider the Stars will be an active tool in your library.
In addition to the sketches and correlating lesson plans that make up the majority of the book, a short study of acting is included at the end of the book with its focus bent toward the Christian actor by understanding that everything a person chooses to do or not to do is based on a belief system.
Why is drama important in presenting moral principles? Its often difficult to repeat what was preached even a moment ago, much less apply it, yet we can all recall a song or story that we heard even decades ago. Likewise, whether you believe he is who he says he is or not, Jesus is remembered mainly because he didnt tell us which way to gohe showed us through the stories he told and the life he lived." />
