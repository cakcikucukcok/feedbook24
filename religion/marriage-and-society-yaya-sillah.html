  <title>Marriage and Society - Yaya Sillah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I thank God (Allah) for giving me well-being and the courage to complete this seven-chapter book. And it has also fulfilled my long-time desire, which is always to share my opinion with different people in different communities. However, human beings are not complete creatures, neither perfect, I am not an exception. You might disagree with some of my opinions, which is very much understandable, because no two people will always agree on the same thing all the time. However, I recommend you and every single reader of this and other books to carefully read every single subject, topic very well, before making any conclusion to agree or disagree. 
Majority of topics and subjects in this book are based on own personal experience and research. And no part of this book is a copy from any other text. However, I get some of my evidence and reference from the holy Quran and the tradition of Prophet Muhammad. You might read a book with an open mind, but the real-life events that took place and I highlighted some of them are always better to act on something you learn before it could happen to you or you might experience it before and you dont want it to happen to you again. I recommend for every reader to follow the best examples which I highlighted, majority of which will surely help you. 
Finally, if I said something that offended you, that is not my intention; my real and true intention is to help people in different level of society in regards to issues facing them. And sometimes it is almost impossible to make your point without using a reference and example that might sound offensive to someone; however, that is not the intention of most authors to offend the readers.
I wish may God (Allah) make it easy for us to accept the truth and follow the right part to him. May Allah keep peace and his blessing hand on the soul of my mother and father who passed away, with the rest of Islamic community who passed away too.	
May Allah increase his peace and tranquillity on the legacy of Prophet Muhammad, his followers, and the rest of Islamic community and individuals.
I end with the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful." />
