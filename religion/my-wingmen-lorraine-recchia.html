  <title>My Wingmen - Lorraine Recchia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My Wingmen is a true account of my journey with angels. They entered my world during a period of inner reflection as I researched personal growth during a challenging life transition. The books I was drawn to came alive as I read about alternate realities and spiritual concepts. I witnessed these realities as my home became a stomping ground for angels and spirit guides, where I enjoyed their appearances and intervention. They showed me how to interpret and discern the lighter side of the earth realm, and they gave me examples of what clear expanded believing could accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I began to openly talk about prayer, my psychic senses began to blossom. I was embraced by two angels, and they offered me healing along with their companionship. They have become my teachers, and they have helped me connect with truths beyond my wildest dreams. It was in expanded thought that I was able to grasp a world that is clearer to me now, as this present-day drama fades to black. I have opened my arms to an enlightened world, because where there is love, there is no room for fear. Meet my wingmen, Archangel Michael and Archangel Raphael.&lt;/p&gt;" />
