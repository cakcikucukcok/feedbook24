  <title>The Church&#39;s One Foundation - Handel Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Handel Lloyd Andrews was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, the eldest of three children of Lloyd Joseph Augustus Andrews and Ruth Maude Andrews. He started following Jesus from an early age and was a roadside preacher in his early teens. He is a devout, bible-believing Christian and a keen student
of bible history and Christian theology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a student of Logic, Ancient philosophy and Ethics, he recognizes that his faith in God cannot be verified, since faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Like Lord Tennyson, he cries,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Strong Son of God, immortal Love,&lt;br&gt;
Whom we, that have not seen thy face,&lt;br&gt;
By faith, and faith alone, embrace,&lt;br&gt;
Believing where we cannot prove;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He ministers the word at every opportunity and remembers the advice of 1 Pater 3:15, Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. This book is a testimony of his faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mr. Andrews holds a B.A. (Honours) in History and an M.A. in English from York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For 9 years, he wrote a religious column, with the pseudonym Bro. Libird,for a prestigious New York newspaper. His last literary endeavour was Guyanas Turbulent Journey to Independence and Beyond, a politi cal and social history of his native land." />
