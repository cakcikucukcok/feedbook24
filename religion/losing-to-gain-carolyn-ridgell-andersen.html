  <title>Losing to Gain - Carolyn Ridgell Andersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 16:2426 (KJV) says Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Our life is more fulfilled and meaningful when we surrender our will to God. Life definitely will hand you surprises, unexpected losses or disappointments but follow Jesus. Allow God to take control, to lead and guide you in everything concerning your life. Only God can take less and do more; take nothing and make something out of it. And God receives the glory. What we consider to be a loss will be a great gain when we are in a relationship with Jesus Christ. It is all about accepting his love, walking in it, living a life that displays it. In a relationship with him, we learn true humility; we develop a prayer life and learn what should have destroyed us only made us stronger. You are uniquely gifted and have an assignment to fulfill in the body of Christ. As stated by the Apostle Paul in Romans 12:1(KJV) that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, and then you will be on a journey destined for greatness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
