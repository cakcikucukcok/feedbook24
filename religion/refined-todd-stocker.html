  <title>Refined - Todd Stocker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life hurts when it is experienced&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;through the flames of tragedy,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;but there is hope.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are answers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is a purpose for it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd had the perfect life: a thriving ministry, a happy and healthy family, and a bright future. All of it was interrupted when his oldest daughter, Makenzie, was killed in a traffic accident. Needing to heal, Todd took a leave of absence from ministry and went to work for a friends company that refines gold and silver. As a refiner, Todd realized that the process of refining metal paralleled the grief and healing that he and his family were experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book,&lt;i&gt; Refined&lt;/i&gt;, Todd examines principles that help answer the questions that surface when pain and tragedy poke their noses into our lives. Whether you have experienced the tragic loss of a loved one or struggle with the daily frustrations of life, Refined will help you understand what God may be up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter includes discussion topics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
