  <title>The Prayers of the New Missal: A Homiletic and Catechetical Companion - Anscar J. Chupungco, Jan Michael Joncas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the publication of &lt;i&gt;The Roman Missal, Third Edition&lt;/i&gt;, much attention was given to the catechesis of the clergy and the faithful on the Order of Mass, which contains the chief theological and spiritual elements of the eucharistic celebration. In &lt;i&gt;The Prayers of the New Missal&lt;/i&gt;, Anscar J. Chupungco expands the reader&#39;s focus to the other parts of the Mass--namely, the orations or the Collect, Prayer over the Offerings, Prayer after Communion, and Prayer over the People. He demonstrates that these elements, too, are a rich source of doctrine and spirituality waiting to be shared with others through homily and catechesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preachers and catechists will especially appreciate Father Chupungco&#39;s recommendations for approaching the difficult and sometimes vexing structure and vocabulary of the new Missal. He offers helpful exercises for analyzing the Latin texts, comparing the original and the English versions, and crafting provisional literal translations that will aid in easier comprehension. Finally, he concludes with an ample sampling of homiletic and catechetical notes that will serve as a rich source of nourishment for preaching and catechesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anscar J. Chupungco, OSB, who passed away in 2013, was a member of the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat in the Philippines. He was president of the Pontifical Liturgical Institute in Rome and is currently director of Paul VI Institute of Liturgy in the Philippines. In 2011, the Federation of Diocesan Liturgical Commissions presented to him the Frederick R. McManus Award for his contribution to pastoral liturgy. He authored many books, including &lt;/i&gt;What, Then, Is Liturgy? Musings and Memoir&lt;i&gt; (Liturgical Press, 2010).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
