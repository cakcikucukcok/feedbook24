  <title>The Chronological Bible Workbook - Linda J. Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This workbook is designed to lead you on a journey through Gods Word as events occurred in time. Your trip begins at Gods creation of the world and ends with His revelation to John. Links to photos and maps are provided to help you navigate your trip with God as He creates the world and establishes His relationship with mankind. Experience the ups and downs of His relationship with the Israelite nation culminating in her division, fall and exile. See how God restores Israel and extends His covenant to all people through the birth, death and resurrection of His Son, Jesus. Learn how early Christians and Christs apostles were persecuted, but still successfully spread the gospel message. Travel with Paul on his missionary journeys and study his letters to churches and individuals exhorting and encouraging them to keep the faith. Share in the messages of other letters written by James, Jude, Peter, the Hebrew writer and John, one of Jesus brothers. Finish your journey with Gods revelation about Christs return and discover what will happen when time comes to an end. From creation to Christs second coming, this study will allow God to reveal His Word to your open heart and mind in a way like no other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
