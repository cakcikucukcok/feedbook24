  <title>Common Wisdom to Proper Understanding - Pastor Stephen Kyeyune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A life lived apart from God ends in disaster. God did not throw us into the troubled waters, in the pool of this world, without giving us the life jacket (blueprint) to help us to swim ashore. In this book, I have summed up everything you need. It consists the recommendable best epigrams from religion, literature, poetry, philosophy, sports, politics, economics, and science. This book unveils nuggets of wisdom strategically one must stake if he or she is seeking success. Above all, it is my pleasure to introduce to you inspiring Christ-like characters. Those of you who are already in the sheepfold of the Chief Shepherd, you will be strengthened, and those thinking about entering, you will be motivated and encouraged. If you are discouraged and thinking about retreating, I give you a reason to reconsider, to think again, and to return to the sheepfold because that is where the future belongs. We have seen what happens to those who walk outside the sheepfold of Christ. My posted mini messages of wisdom are worth your time. You will read them to your satisfaction." />
