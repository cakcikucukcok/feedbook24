  <title>Ceasefire! Religions and the Way to God Controversy - Amelikeh C. E. N.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There has been much speculation and interreligious debates with regards to the number of possible ways that may lead a person to God and what the ways are. Most of the debates have been between Christians and Muslims, and between those people who think there is possibly more than one way to God, and those people who think that only one way is possible by which a human being may get to God, the creator for eternal life. How many ways are truly there to God, one or many? Any of these answers are easy to give but are different depending on ones school of thought or religious affiliation. The truth, or at least the honest evidence, is the only solution to the whole controversy so that peace may prevail for unity to be possible on the issue of the way to God. In this book, the honest evidence of truth of the number and identity of the possible ways to God is discovered by treading the path of neutrality for truth. It is high time we settled the controversy among the religions concerning the way to God." />
