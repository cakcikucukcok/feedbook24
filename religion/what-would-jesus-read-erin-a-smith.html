  <title>What Would Jesus Read? - Erin A. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the late nineteenth century, religiously themed books in America have been commercially popular yet scorned by critics. Working at the intersection of literary history, lived religion, and consumer culture, Erin A. Smith considers the largely unexplored world of popular religious books, examining the apparent tension between economic and religious imperatives for authors, publishers, and readers. Smith argues that this literature served as a form of extra-ecclesiastical ministry and credits the popularity and longevity of religious books to their day-to-day usefulness rather than their theological correctness or aesthetic quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on publishers&#39; records, letters by readers to authors, promotional materials, and interviews with contemporary religious-reading groups, Smith offers a comprehensive study that finds surprising overlap across the religious spectrum--Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, liberal and conservative. Smith tells the story of how authors, publishers, and readers reconciled these books&#39; dual function as best-selling consumer goods and spiritually edifying literature. &lt;i&gt;What Would Jesus Read?&lt;/i&gt; will be of interest to literary and cultural historians, students in the field of print culture, and scholars of religious studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />

Smith's What Would Jesus Read? is the most comprehensive account of popular religious fiction to date. Smith's incisive analysis interrogates the idea of middlebrow reading by including forgotten readers of religious literature along with the books they turned to for solace, entertainment, and pleasure.<br /><b><i>What Would Jesus Read?: Popular Religious Books and ...</i></b> | A. I am fascinated by reading and why people do it. B. Erin A. Smith is my brilliant cousin. So I was motivated to read Ms. Smith's (I usually just call her Erin) book, although its intended audience is academic. I'm really glad I did because Erin's writing is so lucid and her thinking is so creative.<br /><b><i>What Would Jesus Read?: Popular Religious Books and ...</i></b> | Simultaneously sympathetic (What Would Jesus Read? is dedicated to the UUs) and critical (Smith candidly observes that she was made uncomfortable by the proclivity of UUs to see themselves “as the chosen few”), Smith reports the discussion of these books related to “the new Gnosticism” that allowed the UUs “to create religious identity narratives” in which they are “an embattled intellectual aristocracy in an evangelical wasteland” (297).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>What Would Jesus Read? - Erin A.
