  <title>Wash Your Windshield - Richard Paul Weddle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written because God told me I want you to put on paper what Ive been showing you. These words bring life, not condemnation; truth, not deception; hope, not despair. They are words from the Tree of Life, giving us hope, value, identity, and purpose. Many of the counterfeit religious thoughts, misconceptions, faulty human reasoning, and lies that may be embraced are exposed. These things prevent us from seeing ourselves as God sees us and from seeing the vision God has for us. Much of the church has adopted a worldly mindset, leading us to irrelevancy. As each member in the body of Christ focuses their mind on Jesus, hearts and minds are renewed, and vision is restored. We must be like-minded, united in spirit and purpose, so we ultimately finish what Jesus started.&lt;/p&gt;" />
