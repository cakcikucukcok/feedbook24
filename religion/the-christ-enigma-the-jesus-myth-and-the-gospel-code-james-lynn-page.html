  <title>The Christ Enigma - The Jesus Myth and the Gospel Code - James Lynn Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For years now, scholars have known that much of the Christian Bible is the stuff of myth. In short, everything you thought you knew about the Jesus story is wrong!   The Christ Enigma examines the work of scholars and archaeologists to show we&#39;ve taken too much for granted. There never was any Mary and Joseph, birth in Bethlehem, Sermon on the Mount, or Last Supper. And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. What if Jesus himself never existed?   The Christ Enigma also reveals the existence of the Gospel Code, known to scholars of the ancient world. For the gospels are much more than the life-story of the Man from Galilee - they are carefully contrived &#39;codes&#39; that would have been known to the spiritually enlightened of Jesus&#39; day.  But these secret teachings are a secret no longer, and in this fascinating study you&#39;ll discover the real truth about the Da Vinci Code, the Turin Shroud, the Twelve Disciples, Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail ... and Jesus himself." />
