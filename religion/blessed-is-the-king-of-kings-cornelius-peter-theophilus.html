  <title>Blessed Is the King of Kings - Cornelius Peter Theophilus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author inspired by faith and a love for knowledge and prompted by love, has decided to publish this book to open a wide window of ideas on a multitude of issues. &lt;p&gt;
The world has changed and is constantly changing in many ways. But when you look at humanity today, one has to pause and reflect what is really going on in the world. In all aspects of life, you are seeing unprecedented occurrences, whether they are natural and man-made. This book takes a look at those issues in a very objective prism and perspective, analyzing, pointing, correcting issues that have never been touched before, such as religion, science, the use of technology, evolution, architecture, the law and its morality and the judicial system in general, the Bible, God and more. &lt;p&gt;
Whether you are a student or a professional in any field or any branch of study, this book will make you ponder." />
