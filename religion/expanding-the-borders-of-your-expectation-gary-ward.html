  <title>Expanding the Borders of Your Expectation - Gary Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gary Ward taught high school biology for eighteen years and was a seasonal ranger-naturalist for the National Park Service during the summers for most of those years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he received a call into full-time ministry and was pastor of the Living Word Church in Manhattan, Kansas, for thirty-four years. During that time, he wrote several books and booklets as follows:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Books:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Living Free from the Shackles that Bind&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Faith that Moves Mountains: Developing Unwavering Faith &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the Call&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Booklets&lt;/p&gt;: 
&lt;p&gt;Victory over Rulers of Darkness&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Signs and Wonders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gifts of the Holy Spirit&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Victory over Stress and Disease&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Healing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary has become known for the clear and simple way he preaches the Word of God. He always encourages people to apply the Word to their lives and see it manifested as they apply their faith to what God has said. In doing so, many signs and wonders have accompanied the ministry to which Gary was called. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, he passed the baton as pastor of the church he loved and cared for, and he now has a passion for helping other churches expand the borders of their expectation. He is fully convinced that no matter how many great experiences you have had with the Lord, He has much more for all of us.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is designed with that very purpose: to encourage both individual Christ followers and their churches to press on and to keep earnestly desiring and pursuing all God has for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His prayer for the reader of this book is that you will be encouraged to seek the Lord in His fullness and be more and more able to participate in His wondrous works. He has so much more for all of us, and it will all be for His glory!&lt;/p&gt;" />
