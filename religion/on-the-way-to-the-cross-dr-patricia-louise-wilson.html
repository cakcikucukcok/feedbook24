  <title>On the Way to the Cross - Dr. Patricia Louise Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wilson has covered many examples of Christs love to mankind as recorded in the Holy Bible.  She has covered every aspect necessary to change our walk with Jesus Christ from the crucifixion, resurrection, and to sending the Holy Spirit (our Comforter) to be our daily companion.  She shares many personal life experiences where she depended on Christs love during tragic and difficult situations.  When I started reading On the Way to the Cross, I didnt want to put it down.  This book will surely enlighten and enrich your walk with Christ.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenda Johnson, CPM&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wilsons book inspired me to think about what the cross meant to me.  The first word that came to mind is hope!  Hope for mankind!  She portrays this hope through her own experiences, through other authors thoughts, and the precious infallible Word of God.  This nuggets of gold book will build your faith and stir you to reflect upon the cross and Gods love for you.  I found this book to be down to earth, solid, life-changing, faith-building, and easy to read.  The message of the cross is powerful  it will stir your spirit.&lt;p&gt;
