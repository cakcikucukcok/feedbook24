  <title>From the Lowest River Valley to the Highest Mountain Peak - D Malberg, Rabbi Hector, Evelyn Gomez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the Lowest River Valley to the Highest Mountain Peak shows how the Mohler (Malberg) family walks out the Torah, Gods Teaching and Instruction. From an auto accident to a fall at a vacation cottage to pneumonia, Adonai brought Susan and Taavi from tragedies to victories. Along the way, the Mohlers were strengthened spiritually and physically. Yeshua provided all the income and financial blessings that the family needed along the way. All of these adventures started in June of 2013 when the Mohlers joined Relationship Enrichment Center, Beit Tikkun, House of Restoration. Rabbi/Pastor Hector and Evelyn Gomez, Sarah and Jeremy Gomez and other parishioners accepted the Mohler family with open arms. Rachel Mohler first attended R.E.C. The focus of R.E.C. congregation and Rabbi Hector and Evelyn Gomez ministry is finding the Hebrew Roots of the Christian Faith. From the Statement of Faith (Rabbi Gomez): The congregation believes that Yeshua is the Son of God, the Messiah. He is the Word Who became flesh and dwelt among us. [John 1: 1-14] Rabbi Hector and Pastor Evelyn were excited at the Betrothal of their daughter Sarah and Alex McCarthy. The ceremony took place at R.E.C. on Pastor Evelyns birthday in 2014. Also, the betrothal took place on the Feast of Tabernacles eve. Another celebration took place later in the month of June: Eric, the eldest Gomez son, married Katrina in a Messianic Marriage Ceremony at R.E.C. Rabbi Hector presided over the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;" />
