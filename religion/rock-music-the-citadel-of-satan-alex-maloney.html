  <title>Rock Music: the Citadel of Satan - Alex Maloney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="..Let me assure you, the reader, that I am not some slick author who will astound you with a myriad of words and descriptions beyond your understanding, but rather this book is written by an ordinary working man who has spent most of his life away from God, but having been saved by the Grace of God, and having accepted The Lord Jesus Christ into my life, I am now compelled by His Holy Spirit to battle for Him in this area which Satan has made his own. Because this book is written under the influence of the Holy Spirit, not only in content but also in direction, I urge you to read it under the influence of that self same Spirit. The aim of this book is to bring knowledge to Christians and non-Christians alike.&lt;br?
&lt;br?
.Parents and older people, who are reading this book in the hope that you will be able to brow beat the youngsters over their music, first check your own musical tastes. We are dealing with a subject that came to birth in the 1950&#39;s. This means a span of some 40 years. Allowing for someone being a teenager at the   time, we are talking to people aged up to 55 years and possibly slightly over. Yes, it is surprising that rock and roll should affect such a huge portion of our population&lt;br?
&lt;br?
Take any 40 year old junkie who now lives day by day, from one fix to the next, constantly craving for another experience, although that first flood of experiences don&#39;t come now, all that happens is that it takes the pain away for a little while and then it comes back. A social cripple who cannot work because of his dependency, who cannot give of himself to his family because his whole motivation is just to get through the day with as little pain as possible, and whose mind is tormented with fear. Fear that the next fix won&#39;t be there! Fear that the pain might become to much! Fear that they will be caught stealing or prostituting themselves, because this is the type of activity that they have to resort to  just to feed the demon that is inside them. They have to enter other peoples homes to take from them to obtain huge amounts of money inorder to buy from those who control the drugs. They have to submit themselves to sexual degradation and sexual practises that would make many of us sick just to think about. Young and old, boys and girls having to sexually satisfy perverted men who prey on these people, all to feed the demon within, the demon called fear, they are driven by fear. And now the biggest fear of all has come to terrorise them for the rest of their miserable lives, the fear of AIDS !!..... All in the name of Rock Music!" />
