  <title>The Way of Jacob - C R Kuhns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jacob was afraid. He had just seen the God of all creation. The God of all creation, whose Word is holy and trustworthy, had just spoken to him. God had promised to always bless him and never leave him, but could he really trust God? Could he simply believe in the promise of God, or should he try to do something in response? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How was Jacob going to respond? He had heard about his grandfather Abrahams walk down a path in life that was simple and faith-filled. Jacob had watched his brother Esau choose a path that despised the promise of God. Was there a response Jacob could provide that would impress and please God? Possibly if he vowed to tithe, promised God a temple, and promised to make God his Lord, God would be pleased with him. Jacob decided to try this response to God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If his response is typical of our human nature, will we also walk the same pathway that Jacob chose? Is this path of action what God desires of us and does this path truly honor Him? What does the Bible say about the path we are to choose when presented with the promise of blessing that comes through Jesus Christ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Way of Jacob&lt;/i&gt; takes a look at the Word of God to see what response He requires of us. In doing so, we will explore what the Word has to say about human performance in areas such as tithing and other religious works. &lt;/p&gt;" />
