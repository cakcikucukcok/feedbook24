  <title>Stories of the Second Swordsman - Heard Lowry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stories of the Second Swordsman is a collection of allegorical stories written from the viewpoint of a man who was a follower of Christ while He was here on earth. They illustrate spiritual insights in a way that is intended to stimulate thought about the Kingdom of God, and draw in references to occurrences and lessons from the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tales are presented in a first-person narrative of a follower who journeyed through the land on a mission to present the Good News. They portray what life might have been like during the unfolding of the Greatest Story Ever Told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection is organized into four parts to consider aspects of the mission, the creative nature of our response, struggles that are encountered along the way, and how our spiritual ideas can be reshaped. The stories are meant to be thought-provoking and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
