  <title>Shaping the Society Christianity and Culture - Pastor Stephen Kyeyune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;African theology involves theology that reflects the original thinking of African people. Many African have expressed a need for the theology that reflects the original thinking of African peoples. Some theologians have recklessly labeled every aspect of African culture to be evil whereas others  have expressed contempt regarding Christianity wrapped in Europeans culture.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having stayed away from my culture for more than twenty years, I have encountered several cultural shocks. My personal experience has induced me to invest time into intensive researching on the issue of culture and Christianity in anticipation to help somebody puzzled and drowned in confusion. I mean somebody who will not draw a diving line between the two aspects of lives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within every cultural background setting, there is a godly culture that is not in conflict with Christianity. The culture of man apart from God equals to corruption. God created culture and He sent His Son to restore and to preserve the moral values of the cultures. The godly culture of man should therefore not be in conflict with the culture of the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic has been produced in a series of teachings in different volumes of books for deeper clarification. I advise you to read all of the series available for your spiritual growth. &lt;/p&gt;
