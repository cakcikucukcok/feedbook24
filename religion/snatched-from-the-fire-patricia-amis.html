  <title>Snatched from the Fire - Patricia Amis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amis, portraying herself as Sabrina Matheson, was living a relatively normal, happy life when a break-up, and well-intentioned recovery trip kicked off a chain of events that would leave the life she once knew in shambles. She realizes that her step-grandmother, who influenced the spiritual aspect of ex-serial killer David Berkowitz&#39;s life also influenced her spiritual life, but in an adverse way. To help cope with a difficult break-up, Amis&#39; father sends her on a vacation in Jamaica with her best friend. It is there that she almost instantly becomes &quot;consumed into the fire&quot; when she is introduced to a man named Gary and the other worlds of witchcraft. She quickly found herself in the middle of a domestic violence situation, and it became increasingly difficult to be a mother of her two children. The memories of the materialistic life that her father, Mr. Barnes, introduced her to when she was a teenager did not alleviate any of the drama.   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Patricia Amis holds a Bachelor&#39;s degree from Wagner College in Staten Island, New York. She has also attended The New York University Graduate School of Social Work. Patricia is the Host, Founder, and Executive Producer of Elderview Talkshow, which airs on Time Warner Cable and Verizon Fios." />
