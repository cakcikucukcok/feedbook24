  <title>Assault on Marriage - Thomas D. Logie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marriage is under assault in most of the world.  In the Western world the idea of God as Creator is largely scorned and rejected in intellectual circles.  It is then logical for these intellectuals to attack marriage as well because marriage was the first institution that God created.  It precedes any form of human government.  Now we see some of the results of the assault on marriage.  Children suffer.  The cohesion of many marriages breaks down, whether there is a formal divorce or not.  That means emotional stresses that human beings were not designed to handle.  The very foundation of marriage, the attraction of one man to one woman, is under challenge.  All of this is based on the assumption that either there is no Creator or that the Creator does not care what we do with His Creation.  
	But what if both of these assumptions are wrong?  What if the Creator pushes back at human challenge and disobedience?  Is there a way back to joy and harmony between the Creator and humanity?  There are then two alternatives: either we human beings repent and return to what the Creator instructed in the Bible, or devastating judgment from the Creator will follow.  The Bible warns only too clearly that the judgment will in fact fall and that Jesus Christ will impose Gods rule with a rod of iron (Revelation 2:27, 19:15), although it gives no precise timetable.  But judgment has not yet fallen in full, and there may be time for individuals, families and even nations to repent and join Gods family before all hope is gone.  This book is intended to address practical issues and forgotten Scriptures in maintaining lifetime marriages and to help churches start to help marriages between men and women to stick together.  It is designed either for individual or group study and discussion for teenagers and adults." />
