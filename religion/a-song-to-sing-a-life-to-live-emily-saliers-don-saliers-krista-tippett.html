  <title>A Song to Sing, a Life to Live - Emily Saliers, Don Saliers, Krista Tippett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celebrating the spirit of song&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Song to Sing, a Life to Live&lt;/i&gt;, Don and Emily Saliers help readers see the connections between Saturday night music and Sunday morning music by exploring the spiritual dimensions of music itself. They tell the stories of their own lives in music, and they share what they have learned and observed about the power of music in human life. They help us appreciate the joy of music and also how music carries us into places of sorrow, where we must go if we are to live with honesty about ourselves and compassion for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for churchgoers and spiritual seekers alike. Music is described in terms of spiritual practice; it has the power to embrace those who are deeply immersed in the life of Christian faith and speak to those who are spiritual but may question formal religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book explores a wide variety of musical traditions and offers an invitation to embrace a broader and deeper vision of the power of music and the spiritual dimensions of attentive listening. &quot;This is a beautiful expression of music as many things--healer, gift, symbol of freedom and community, and agent of change&quot; (Mary Chapin Carpenter).&lt;/p&gt;" />
