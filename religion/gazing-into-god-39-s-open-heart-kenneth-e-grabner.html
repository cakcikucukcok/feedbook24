God in his love has opened his heart through the message and actions of Jesus, and Jesus has revealedGod&#39;s loving planto us. This gift of intimacy is meant to enrich us and to be the cause of our joy. Joy is Jesus intention for all, for he says that he has spoken to us so that our joy may be full (John &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:time Minute=&quot;11&quot; Hour=&quot;15&quot;&gt;15:11&lt;/st1:time&gt;). This &lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;book invites us to gaze into Gods open heart, and prayerfully reflect on the joy that comes fromwelcoming all thatJesus has revealed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;Not only the words of Jesus, but all the words of Scripture reveal what is in Gods heart. We can find a multitude of ways to joy through the personal application of the message of the Bible to our lives. This book uses the term 101 ways to joy to emphasize this idea. If we pay attention to our lives in the light of what Scripture tells us, we come to notice an overflowing sense of peaceful delight growing within ourselves. The 101 ways to joy are embedded in Jesus life, words and actions, and in the words and actions of the Bible as a whole. Joy is Gods gift to those who seek to understand these words and actions, and to live by them. &lt;/P&gt;

This allows time for reflection that enables readers to make the ideas a part of their lives.
