  <title>Encounter with Destiny - Pastor Victoria Rollins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, Encounter with Destiny, tells you the truth. It may be that you dont have an answer to lifes issues, but God does. You may not have the strength, but God does. You may have neglected God, but he has not abandoned you. He has already released good things into your future destiny.
Drawing from my experience and those around me, Encounter with Destiny offers messages of hope, faith, and strength to help you rise above any circumstance so you can fulfill Gods best plan for your life. There are nuggets and prayer points and practical tools for moving toward your destiny. Remember, Encounter with Destiny is an encounter with God. Jeremiah 1:5 states that even before you were born, God already knew you. It is your time to seek for Gods guidance and to give Him control of your life so you can find fulfillment in in his plans for you (Jer. 29:11)." />
