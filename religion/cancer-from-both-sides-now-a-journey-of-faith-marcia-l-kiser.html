  <title>Cancer from Both Sides Now … a Journey of Faith - Marcia L. Kiser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a spiritual and clinical guide from a faith perspective. It is designed to encourage anyone enduring cancer treatments and its debilitating side effectsor anyone with a terminal illnessto always maintain their faith in Gods healing powers and know that there is always faith, hope, and love if we simply are patient, look upward, and seek Gods divine guidance. Mrs. Kiser describes her rollercoaster ride as she experiences her cancer and radiation therapy. Although she has her world torn inside out and upside down by fear and doubt, she witnesses the healing power and strength that comes from slowing down in life, taking one day at a time, and listening to God as He speaks to us in many different ways to help us cope with our illness and find a road to recovery through a journey of faith. Mrs. Kisers background in psychology, counseling, and courses in death and dying can inspire anyone to face the stages of dying as a normal human process and still find courage and victory in living each day to the fullest. Mrs. Kiser is more than qualified to offer this guidance because she is not only an oncology nurse with many years of experience, but she is also a cancer patient herself who shares her own life experiences in the hope of inspiring others to a better and fuller quality of lifedespite the odds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
