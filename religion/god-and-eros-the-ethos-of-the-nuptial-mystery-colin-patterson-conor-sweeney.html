  <title>God and Eros: The Ethos of the Nuptial Mystery - Colin Patterson, Conor Sweeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What can God and eros have to do with each other? Against Nietzsche&#39;s claim that Christianity poisoned eros, God and Eros rereads the mystery of human love as an ecstatic sharing in the mystery of the triune God who is Love. Body, sex, and affectivity, far from being locked in a lower order called &quot;nature,&quot; instead belong to a sacramental order that is permeated by the call to love. In presentations designed to appeal to a general audience, the faculty of the John Paul II Institute for Marriage and Family, Melbourne, approach this mystery through the lens of St. John Paul II&#39;s &quot;theology of the body,&quot; with the goal to both introduce and more clearly illumine its major features. In particular, emphasis is placed on how a theology of the body is not just about &quot;sex.&quot; Rather, it is above all about how each and every person--no matter what her state of life--is stamped by the watermark of being-from and being-for. Working within this broader perspective, God and Eros offers the reader a lively, engaging, and at times challenging tour of the full &quot;ethos of the nuptial mystery.&quot;" />
