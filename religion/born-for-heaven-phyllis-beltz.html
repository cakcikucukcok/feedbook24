  <title>Born for Heaven - Phyllis Beltz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three deaths of family members in four years, including my husband, did not prepare me for the words I was hearing from the police chief. Christopher has been killed by a school bus. Death did not come quietly that cold February morning but crashed into my life like a destroying tornado. The tragic death of my tenyear- old grandson, whom I was raising, set me on a deep, dark journey into grief. This was a frightening journey I had never traveled before, and I didnt want to be on this path of despair. I was not alone, for a gracious, loving, sovereign God journeyed with me through this strange, unknown valley and brought me through to victory. Someday there will be a final victory over death, as we see in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation 21:4: And He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there shall no longer be any death; there shall no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain the first things have passed away.&lt;br /&gt;
