Well, no one has the right not to be offended - especially when his or her alleged moral code is itself offensive.   It is the duty of the nonreligious to confront theobabble head-on. This book debunks religious malarkey one fantasy at a time: that a god created the universe and actively interacts with it; that Jesus walked and preached on this earth; that people of all religions can &quot;coexist&quot;; that atheists are inherently evil. This book further shows that those who follow the dictates of their faith most fervently pose the greatest menace to society." />
