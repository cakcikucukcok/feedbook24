  <title>Where Faith Abounds - Frances M Chioma Ebisike-Eboh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a warehouse of stories of many deaths around me and my family and how I coped with them. It deals with lifes vicissitudes and unshakable faith which will encourage readers to effectively cope with loss. Readers will understand Gods unfailing love and develop faith that will help them persevere in the face of adversity. They will also understand Gods grace which is the cornerstone of success in any human endeavor. Salvation is another important component of this book, and I have joyfully related and reiterated its necessity for eternity. An important and interesting part of this book deals with my encounter with a known atheist, and what happened afterward will surprise readers. Moreover, this book was prayerfully written and will remain a glorious and anointed masterpiece for ages to come. It can also serve an academic purpose, especially for those in the arts and social sciences with particular focus on the subject of bereavement. I have no doubt that it will make a big and positive impact on those who read, and more importantly, meditate on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frances Ebisike-Eboh writes with a raw emotion giving you a pick into the lab of real life experiences with life and death. Her personal experiences through the peaks and valleys of life are inspiring, and her honesty about struggles with faith in the dark seasons of life is refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Russell Hodgins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What incredible stories that will be sure to encourage you and open your eyes to the many ways God might be working in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor David VanDonge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
