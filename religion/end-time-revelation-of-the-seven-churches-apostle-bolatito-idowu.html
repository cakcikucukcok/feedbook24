  <title>End Time Revelation of the Seven Churches - Apostle Bolatito Idowu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an assignment from heaven when I had and outer body experience to heaven. I was given few assignments for the end times. One of them was to write two books, and this is one of the books. End time Revelation of the seven churches. The book simple and explicit for everyone to understand regardless of your race, age, nationality or level of education. 
Every Christian on earth fits into one of the seven churches described in the book of Revelations in the bible. It is very important for every Christian to know which church he or she fits into and make necessary corrections, and repent in order to avoid the judgments of God. For if we would Judge ourselves, we should not be judged (1cor.11:31).
We are blessed to have the opportunity (the Grace) from heaven to call our attention regarding the coming of the lord which is also known as The First Resurrection (rev 20:6).Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on such the second death hath no power. According to the revelation that I have from heaven, we are the last generation. Therefore, Individuals should take this message seriously if we really care for our souls. People should not play church nor have any motives other than pleasing God, and seeking for his will in all things. In other words walk in the spirit that you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. Our God loves us more then what we can imagine and more than anyone or anything in this world. We should seek Him with all our hearts and do not fall into deception, because no one can deceive him. My advice is for individuals to pray and be very sincere to examine themselves to see which church they really fit into, so that adequate corrections can be made, and let God be glorified. If it is difficult to examine yourself, ask the Holy Spirit to reveal yourself to you. I am sure the Holy Spirit will do it, he may reveal through the words, prophecy, dreams, visions, words of knowledge, words of wisdom or through any other means of revelation. Whatever it takes to be right with him it is what we do. Enough of the deception on earth. We have the words of God to guide us and the Seven Churches as the examples of how God judges the church (Christians). This book is not mans doctrine of religion but the truth of the word, and the truth shall set us free, Amen." />
