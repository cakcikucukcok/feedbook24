  <title>In Life—In Death—He Leads - Bruce Blair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bruce Blair was born into a South Dakota farming family experiencing the Dust Bowl, the Great Depression, locust plagues, and storms that stole the harvests on which the family depended. After marriage and the loss of a newborn son, another son, Larry, was found to have a life-threatening heart defect. Out of this dark time came a searching for lifes meaning and spiritual rebirth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From then till now, miracles followed Bruce and his family. God spared Larrys life from drowning and later provided a bumper harvest to pay for an expensive operation. God protected him financially when his loaned, uninsured farm truck collided with a car. Bruce himself was buried alive when a pipe ditch collapsed. God directed the rescue of a friend from financial ruin leading him to a life of ministry. His story of a barren cow and a foreign mission is an amazing proof that God exists. In his eighties a serious fall down a flight of stairs brought an unexpected and miraculous outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lifein DeathHe Leads reveals the unsearchable riches of Christ that are available on ones journey through life. Biblical references, mostly from the King James Version of the Bible, and Christian living principles are cited.&lt;/p&gt;" />
