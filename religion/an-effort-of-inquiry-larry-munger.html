  <title>An Effort of Inquiry - Larry Munger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work digs into many questions with no firm answers. Simply reviewing the table of contents will show the many different questions that are looked into. In addition, there is additional history involved that may not be common knowledge to everybody. People have said I just love Joseph Smith and yet why? Did he break the law repeatedly, as is shown in this work? Was he morally correct? Did he engage in sexual unions with women who were married to other men at the same time? Did he simply copy other men in his area who claimed to have revelations from God? Why is his story of God appearing to him very similar to other mens claims that were already published in his own hometown? Did he really translate gold plates? Why did he deny he practiced polygamy while he was actually living in polygamy at the time?" />
