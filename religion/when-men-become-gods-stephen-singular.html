  <title>When Men Become Gods - Stephen Singular</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;When Men Become Gods, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Stephen Singular casts a light on a dark corner of religious extremism. He reveals a group of fundamentalists operating in the present-day United States, where teenage girls are kept in virtual bondage in the name of upholding the &quot;sacred principle&quot; of polygamy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the leader and self-proclaimed prophet of the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, a sect of Mormonism based in isolated southern Utah, Warren Jeffs held sway over thousands of followers for nearly a decade. His rule was utterly tyrannical. In addition to coercing young girls into polygamous marriages with older men, Jeffs reputedly took scores of wives, many of whom were his father&#39;s widows. Television, radio, and newspapers were shunned, creating a hidden community where polygamy was prized above all else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2007, after a two-year manhunt that landed him on the FBI&#39;s Ten Most Wanted List, Jeffs&#39;s reign was forcefully ended. He was convicted of rape as an accomplice for his role in arranging a marriage between a fourteen-year-old girl and her nineteen-year-old first cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;When Men Become Gods, &lt;/i&gt;Edgar Award nominee Stephen Singular traces Jeffs&#39;s rise to power and the concerted effort that led to his downfall. It was a movement championed by law enforcement, private investigators, the Feds, and perhaps most vocal of all, a group of former polygamous wives seeking to liberate young women from the arranged marriages they&#39;d once endured. The book offers new revelations into a nearly impenetrable enclave---a place of nineteenth-century attire, inbreeding, and eerie seclusion---providing readers with a rare glimpse into a tradition that&#39;s almost a century old, but that has only now been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
