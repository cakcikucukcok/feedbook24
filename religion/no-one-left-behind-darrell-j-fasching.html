  <title>No One Left Behind - Darrell J. Fasching</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1. You have heard it said that on the day of judgment only Christians will be saved and all others will be consigned to eternal damnation, but I say to you that the gospel proclaims salvation for the whole human race.
2. You have heard it said that non-Christians are strangers who will not enter the Kingdom of God, but I say to you that God enters our lives through the very presence of the stranger.
3. You have heard it said that heretics and sinners will have no place in the Kingdom of God, but I say to you that to reject even the least of these is to reject God and Gods messiah.
4. You have heard it said that human beings can be saved in no other name than that of Jesus, but I say to you that the name Jesus means we are saved in the name of a God who cannot be named or imaged.
5. You have heard it said that only a chosen remnant can be saved, but I say to you that a saving remnant saves not itself but the whole human race of which it is a part.
6. You have heard it said that in the final judgment many will be consigned to the eternal fires, but I say to you, Gods judgment is a refining fire which transforms and saves rather than destroys. The final truth is that our God is the savior of the whole human race and especially all believers (1Timothy 4:10)." />
