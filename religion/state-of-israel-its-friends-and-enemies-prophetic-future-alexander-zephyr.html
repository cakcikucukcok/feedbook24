  <title>State of Israel. Its Friends and Enemies. Prophetic Future - Alexander Zephyr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;The State of Israel; Its Friends and Enemies. Prophetic Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an indispensable work telling us all we need to know on several matters. Discusses various issues succinctly summarizing different schools of thought with their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the Wars of Gog and Magog? What will cause them? Which forces will be involved? Who and what is the Messiah and the Messianic Age? Will there be a physical Resurrection of the Dead? How old is the earth? Were there humanoid-type beings before us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish and non-Jewish scholarship on all issues is quoted and compared. The author then brings his own opinion and the reasons for it. Whether you are a full-time researcher in this field or just an interested layman you will find in this work information and points of interest of great value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr is not afraid to face controversy. He brings sources and argues well with passion, eloquence, and conviction.  He has carried out a work of serious scholarship with nerve and passion. The writers interest and thirst for knowledge concerning his theme comes bursting through on every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most of the World unjustly goes against the Jews.  Anti - Semitism, hatred and racism have reached unprecedented levels. The very survival of the Jewish state of Israel is at stake. All people of good will, who believe in the Bible as the Sacred Word of the Almighty, should make a choice and stand firmly on the side of Israel. That is what God wants them to do. In turn, they will save themselves and help God to advance His Divine Plan for the World-to-Come, which would be absolutely impossible if Israel did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you (i.e. Israel) shall all families of the earth be blessed (Genesis 12:3).&lt;/p&gt;" />
