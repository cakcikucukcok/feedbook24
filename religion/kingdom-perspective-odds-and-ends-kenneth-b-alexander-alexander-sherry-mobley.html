If nothing else it should be interesting as there are some off the wall topics included, as well as some of my attempts at poetry. But if you look at the Table of Contents you might find something interesting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For instance &amp;quot;Was America Founded As a Christian Nation&amp;quot;? Or the history of Babylon or the history of the Nephilim? How about &amp;quot;God and Science&amp;quot;? How about the paganism attached to the Roman Church, who ruled Rome for 1000 years? There are some more familiar topics, always involved with Walking with God In the spirit. Also &amp;quot;Will There Ever Be world Peace&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Role of Faith In Politics&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve even included a peace on &amp;quot;Christian Astrology&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Biblical Numerology&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here&amp;#39;s hoping you enjoy it and learn a thing or two." />
