  <title>Pillars of Greatness - Joshua Owolabi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pillars of Greatness is a piece that considers life pursuits from the perspective of purposefulness and sustainable fulfillment. It emphasizes the need to live life purposefully. While most of us are basically in constant pursuit of success, there is more to fulfillment than these discrete achievements that are called successes. Greatness is rather the ultimate- linking purpose and destiny to fulfillment. Greatness comes when successes are sustainable by principles and consistent with purpose. 
There are four pillars to greatness: vision, passion, actions and principles. The book illustrates the processes involved in quality envisioning, mechanisms of building burning and driving passion, strategies of effecting potent actions, and principles of sustaining greatness. Its a piece like no other on this subject. The uniqueness of the authors approach and the inspiring and compelling approach to teaching fundamental life principles becomes irresistibly impactful and inspiring. The reader is spontaneously ignited into motion towards greatness upon assimilating the content of this book! 
There is greatness in you, but you will choose whether to express it through your use of the pillars to build your tower of greatness. Will you be great? Its your choice!" />
