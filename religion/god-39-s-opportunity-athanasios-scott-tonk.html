  <title>God&#39;s Opportunity - Athanasios Scott Tonk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We human beings have messed up so badly. We have atomized the Body of Christ so that only a miracle can heal the wounds of the Body again. But God is already acting to heal the Body of His Son, as you will see in part 1 of the book.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book does not deal in generalities when it comes to Christians. It views the Body of Christ as one big family complete with a mother; our heavenly Father; His Son, who is the head of the Body; and children, kissin&#39; cousins, aunts, uncles, and so forth. Oh, yes, we have had our fights, but they have all been family fights. Now this book issues a challenge to all of the members of the family: Appreciate one another&#39;s heritage and bring it to the table of the Lord.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is also a call to greater evangelism and mission, but it by and large recognizes that the churches are going all out to bring the world to Christ.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Gods Time  Its Kingdom Time  
Its the Fullness of Time  Its Gods Opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;" />
