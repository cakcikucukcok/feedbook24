  <title>The Third Testament Part I - Daniel McTaggart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After several years of biblical study, I concluded that the truth, the Word of God, was essential and that no other religion is with that mode.
After a tentative beginning in 1987, it is a ready-for-the-world, mature religion now.
The religion is mercifully short, borrowing key components from the Old and New Testaments.
It presents what I consider the best of Jesus, but I am fully aware that much more could have been included in the category of best. Short of breaking down all of Jesuss sayings, I opted for what I considered the most important for daily life. Im sure some readers will find glaring omissions.
The Sermon on the Mount speaks of being blessed, as most Bibles state. I prefer being happy or having happiness, as substituted in The Jerusalem Bible.
When I speak of being happy, what comes to mind are components that did not exist during the time Jesus lived: many genres of music and the wide availability of marijuana.
Jesus said to visit the sick and the imprisoned. I hope to make this life better by even allowing alcohol and several for those incarcerated.
I am an optimist (see Ecclesiastes 3:18).
Jesus never charged a penny for teaching. The God of Daniel is God the Father.
1) Jesus, 2) Beatitudes, 3) marijuana, and 4) time and a season to every purpose under the heaven." />
