  <title>Called to Freedom: Why You Can Be Christian and Libertarian - Elise Daniel, Norman Horn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Conservatism, Republican politics, and traditional Christianity are thought by some to go together like baseball and apple pie. Yet, for a growing number of people, libertarian political thought provides an alternative to the traditional Christian right. That number includes the six young authors of this book who explore and expound the case that one can be both a Christian and a libertarian.   Called to Freedom explores the major points of tension between the Christian faith and political liberty to demonstrate why the two can coexist in harmony. Through their own personal experiences, and from six different perspectives, the authors offer both thoughtful arguments and encouragement to anyone navigating the space between Christianity and libertarianism. It is in that space that the authors have found a home, one that prioritizes the kingship of Jesus Christ and the inherent dignity of the people created in his image.    If you are a Christian exploring libertarian thought, or if you feel caught between your Christian beliefs and libertarian political instincts, this book is written for you.  Contributors: Jacqueline Isaacs is the inaugural Fellow in Strategic Communication at the American Studies Program in Washington, DC. She earned her MBA in marketing at Johns Hopkins University and her BS in government at Oral Roberts University.  Jason Hughey is a certified personal trainer and group fitness instructor. He earned his BA in government from Regent University in 2012 and worked for several liberty-advancing nonprofits before switching to the fit- ness industry full-time.  Taylor Barkley lives in Washington, DC with his wife and works at a public policy organization and part-time with Search Ministries. He graduated from Taylor University with a degree in history and political science.  Leah Hughey is a graduate of Regent University, where she studied government and history. She works at a Christian ministry focused on fostering collaboration between charities and churches to solve social problems in the cities they serve. Leah has been happily married to coauthor Jason since 2013.  Philip Luca is an award-winning marketing strategist working with tech companies and startups in the DC area. He currently serves on the board of the American Marketing Association, DC as the VP of Social Media. He holds two graduate degrees from Liberty University in digital media and theology." />
