      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Vargas has been writing music for years, bringing inspiration and encouragement to her listeners. Now Carolyn has written a companion book to her latest album release, &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Seasons&lt;/em&gt;. Through the pages of this book, Carolyn takes us on a journey through the many seasons of life, sharing her own life experiences, as well as the inspiration and events that gave birth to the songs she has written for her newly released album. Carolyn writes with great candor, baring her soul, exposing her own vulnerabilities, and sharing from her heart the joys and the sorrows that brought her to this place in life. From the miracle of having a child, to the devastation of a broken marriage, Carolyn reminds us that Christ Jesus is our redeemer, and there is no situation and no circumstance that He cannot redeem. From the first breath of life until the very last, God is faithful and has a wonderful plan for each person as they journey through the seasons of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
