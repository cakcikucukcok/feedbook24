  <title>The End of Secularism - Hunter Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This ambitious work offers one of the most comprehensive attacks on secularism yet attempted. Hunter Baker argues that advocates of secularism misunderstand the borders between science, religion, and politics and cannot solve the problem of religious difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; University scholars have spent decades subjecting religion to critical scrutiny. But what would happen if they turned their focus on secularism? Hunter Baker seeks the answer to that question by putting secularism under the microscope and carefully examining its origins, its context, its claims, and the viability of those claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The result of Baker&#39;s analysis is &lt;em&gt;The End of Secularism&lt;/em&gt;. He reveals that secularism fails as an instrument designed to create superior social harmony and political rationality to that which is available with theistic alternatives. Baker also demonstrates that secularism is far from the best or only way to enjoy modernity&#39;s fruits of religious liberty, free speech, and democracy. &lt;em&gt;The End of Secularism&lt;/em&gt; declares the demise of secularism as a useful social construct and upholds the value of a public square that welcomes all comers, religious and otherwise, into the discussion. The message of &lt;em&gt;The End of Secularism&lt;/em&gt; is that the marketplace of ideas depends on open and honest discussion  rather than on religious content or the lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;" />
