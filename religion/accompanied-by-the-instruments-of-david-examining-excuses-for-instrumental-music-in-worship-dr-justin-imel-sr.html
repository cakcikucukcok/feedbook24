  <title>Accompanied By the Instruments of David: Examining Excuses for Instrumental Music In Worship - Dr. Justin Imel, Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Instrumental music is once more rearing its ugly head among churches of Christ. Congregations are adding instrumental music to worship because they &quot;can&#39;t see anything wrong with it.&quot; Maybe the instrument is added to draw more people into the assembly. Perhaps some advocate instrumental music, for, like L. L. Pinkerton, the singing is abysmal. Dr. Justin Imel, Sr., comes from a family where instrumental music was considered acceptable; therefore, he has heard nearly every argument under the sun to justify its use in worship. In this work, Dr. Imel examines arguments in favor of instrumental music and finds them wanting. Accompanied by the Instruments of David lays out a forceful argument for a cappella singing in worship." />
