  <title>A Merry Heart Doeth Good Like a Medicine - Steven, Kimberly Merry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;These poems have been written for the souls of the people that are looking to ask if God is alive. Read this book and ask your self this question, &quot;Where is my soul going to spend eternity.&quot; If you say that you do not have a soul, then you are deceiving yourself. If you deceive yourself and people follow, you then you will be leading them astray. All I am trying to say is that this poem book will help lift the soul, maybe bring a little hope or a smile to the heart that is hurting. When the body does not feel good, we ask for some type of medicine.  When the soul is not feeling well, it needs to be lifted up. We need to start with prayer and read the word of God first.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;That is the true food of our being, poetry is from the heart. I have found everybody has something to say to everybody!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This book is what I have to say about Jesus (GOD) in my life. Back to the question: &quot;Were is your soul going to spend eternity, with God or without God?&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus from the dead and you will be saved. God Bless! Amen!  &lt;/P&gt;" />
