  <title>Soul Chants - Adrian T McGrath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Soul Chants&#39; is a diverse selection of discourses of esotericisms, which covers life from the soul, as it travels through the garden of lifes thorns, from the seed to the pod. Spiritual and philosophical, these discourses capture profoundness with soul searching topics that every soul should feel, and relate to, as it passes through the waterfall of its own awakening, from birth to death. 
This Northern Irish prophetic medium, Adrian mc Grath utilizes his metaphysical awareness to enwrap himself, within these discourses, as they touch the basis of the soul, &quot;especially the question and answer session&quot; due to the form and depth of conveyance. As the dictation of structure touches your inner essence, you become enveloped within the flow, as a new world of inner vision opens up, and it leads you on a path of inner connection. As you become wrapped within these words of ancient, thought provoking discourses, where the beauty of the spirit is actually felt, allowing one to look within. As the soul finds it&#39;s rose, alongside the thorns of life, as petals unfold to the beauty of you." />
