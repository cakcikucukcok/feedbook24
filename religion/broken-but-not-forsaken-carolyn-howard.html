  <title>Broken but Not Forsaken - Carolyn Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a must-read! We all have testimonies, but this testimony will keep you on your toes wondering what happens to her next. It&#39;s an awesome testimony of how God Can and His Glory. When life takes a crash, this book will help you go through and persevere in hard, tough times. When everyone seems to be gone, turn their backs, their spouse walks out the door and you lose everything you own; even down to the place in which you live. It&#39;s like a glass that falls to the ground and shatters and you don&#39;t know where you begin to pick up first. This book is for Pastors, Pastor&#39;s wives, men and women alike. Don&#39;t give up! Keep pushing and if you have fallen, get back up! Don&#39;t allow the enemy to keep you down. GOD IS A RESTORER. HALLELUJAH!&lt;p&gt;" />
