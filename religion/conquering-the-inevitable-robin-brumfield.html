  <title>Conquering the Inevitable - Robin Brumfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a book about change, not only what change is, but also how change affects us, our responses to change, and finally, a biblical model for overcoming change. You may ask, Why a book about change? The reason is that we live in a world of change. Change occurs in our lives on a daily basis. Change is the only thing that is constant. Look around you. Change is everywhere and occurs interpersonally, relationally, constantly (organizations either getting smaller or larger), technologically (increases are at an astronomical rate). Even the focus of the church changes as culture changes (sacred old hymns to contemporary music, and single pastor to multi-ministerial staffs), and on it goes. Change definitely is constant, and change is everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robin Brumfield takes us by the hand with a Bible in the other hand, and walks along some Bible trails where change took place and helps us to see a reflection of our own existence in some of these experiences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Futral&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Executive Director  Treasurer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
