  <title>This Is My Story, This Is My Song - Sheila Turrentine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I felt a shift in my grieving as it went from earthly bound to heavenly bound; I could smile at just the thought of the day when I would see her face to face. I no longer cried because I wanted her back in my world, but I looked forward to the day that I would join her in her, new world. My heart-cry was gone and replaced with the peace of knowing that this earthly life is just a vapor of our existence.
This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all day long! This line was continuously going through my thoughts as I began this book about the unexpected loss of Emilie, my 18-year-old daughter, in a tragic accident.
I lay open my heart and share the good, bad, and ugly of the whole emotional process. I cannot even fathom where or who I would be right now if I had no faith in God and his heart-healing power. Most of all, I want people to know that with Jesus they are not alone in their grief." />
