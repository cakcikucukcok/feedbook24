  <title>Beauty by Divine Design - Myrline R. Belzince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you beautiful? Are you trying every day, tirelessly, to be beautiful, but still feel as though you fall short? Beauty runs deeper than your skin complexion, the size of your jeans, or the length of your hair. In Beauty by Divine Design, Dr. Belzince takes you down to the molecular level and brings you all the way up to your present-day lifestyle. With inspiration from Psalm 139 as a mirror, she shows you that you were born beautiful. You were beautiful even before you were born, because God had plans for you even then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you see on the outside is but a glimpse of your true and deep beauty both spiritual and physical. You will find, packaged just for you, tips to enhance your inner and outer beauty while staying true to yourself and honoring God with your divine gifts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will discover&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; that God created you beautiful and He knows you from the inside out, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; that your soul and body matter to God,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; how to cultivate your inner beauty,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; how to enhance your outer beauty,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; how to have an attitude of beauty, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
