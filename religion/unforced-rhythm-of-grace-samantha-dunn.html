  <title>Unforced Rhythm of Grace - Samantha Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How much pain, abuse, and abandonment in a lifetime can one person endure and still come out whole? Unforced Rhythm Of Grace describes the length, the width, the height and the depth of God&#39;s love and grace extended to Samantha. A life from childhood full of tragedies and triumph, death to life, and messes to miracles. The story she reveals is every kind of deception known to mankind. In this destroyer labyrinth of loss, disillusionment, abuse and grief, Father God kept showing her His love providing ways of escape and mercy. Father God was lavish in His pursuit and never ending His desire to reveal His love for her. It wasn&#39;t until 2004-2005 that she finally awaken to a God who so wanted to reveal Himself to her as a Father and Husband she never had. This is a real life journey of astonishing redemption, grace, mercy, restoration and a dawning of the great and genuine love of her Father God. Who graciously gave her the desires of her heart, a genuine godly husband. This journey is truly shocking of the amount of abandonment one person endured and came out with a clear mind and whole heart, who is able to help others today to get free from their labyrinth of deception. This would not have been possible, except for the hot pursuit of a loving Savior.&lt;/p&gt;" />
