  <title>Beauty Defiled, Beauty Revealed - Mark Scholten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; What happens when you have God&#39;s blessing nailed down, and then without warning an evil intruder rips everything apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a corner on the good life. Driven by my material appetite, strategically balanced by religion, I desperately played both sides. Comfortable in a good marriage, with two kids, and a home situated on a small horse farm, I was truly blessed.&lt;br/&lt;br/&gt; Everything changed in an instant with the discovery of a lump, but some things changed in ways I could never have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;By probing the joy and heartache of the past in the redemptive light of precious promises kept, this narrative paints a picture of beauty defiled unfolding to startling beauty revealed. You&#39;re invited on a journey of discovery that may change the way you think about blessing.&lt;br /&gt;A story of praise and healing, though not in the popular sense; it&#39;s a drama of marital love and faithfulness that prevails against great odds.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Sherwin (Chic) Broersma, D. Min., Retired RCA Pastor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Mark&#39;s journey into death leads you beyond the struggle to a hallowed place of surrender. You will be both encouraged and equipped through this book.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Schieber, singer, songwriter, author, speaker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Find hope in the midst of deep grief and loss.
