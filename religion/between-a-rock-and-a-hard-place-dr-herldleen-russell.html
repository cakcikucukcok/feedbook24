  <title>Between a Rock and a Hard Place - Dr. Herldleen Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During a particular period in my life, I felt as if I was between the proverbial rock and hard place. It was as when the children of Israel in the book of Exodus on their journey to the Promised Land came to a place where Pharaohs army was behind and the Red Seas was in front. I could not go forward and had no plans to go backward, and the Red Sea would not open up to go forward. The frustration of being in that place was terrible, and I was at my wits end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as an airplane arriving at its destination and preparing to land is told that it will not be able to do so because of some unforeseen circumstances is placed in a holding pattern, so was I. Come, journey with me and see and learn what the Lord taught me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life happens to our best-laid plans, but God orders our steps even when we seemingly are not moving. I was not between a rock and a hard place; I was in Gods holding pattern.&lt;/p&gt;" />
