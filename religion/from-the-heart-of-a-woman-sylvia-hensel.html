  <title>From the Heart of a Woman - Sylvia Hensel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;So many times when author Sylvia Hensel in prayer, she finds herself transported to another place. She feels herself being lifted up on arms of love to a realm of oneness with her Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She feels as though she is the bride in the Song of Solomon. He comes to her in the midnight hours and calls her to Himself. Every nerve of her spiritual being is in tune with Him as He whispers words of love in her ear. He takes her in His arms, and they dance across the heavens while He sings over her. She is enraptured by His exquisite love for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those moments they share their intimate thoughts with one another. It is when His presence is lifted that she finds she has written much of what was said, and she is awestruck at the beauty that had transpired during the time they shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are her personal love letters to Jesus. For many years He would not allow her to share them, but He has let her know this is the time. It is His desire that you too experience this intimacy with Him. Jesus would have us claim Him as our spiritual husband and intends that our desire should be toward Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants to lavish His love on us as the bridegroom for the bride and have it returned with the fullness of passion. He wants us to love Him to the point of abandonment, resulting in a consummated love. He wants our spiritual womb to be forever fertile, producing beautiful fruit of wondrous delight for the world to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. (Genesis 4:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
