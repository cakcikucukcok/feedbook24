  <title>The Warrior - Charles J. Pettitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Endorsement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warrior brought back many memories of the past in my life and some current day battles I still face. As a former UFC and Pride fighter I faced many of the same ridicule and resistance from the Religious community and personal friends.  People would ask me daily how I could be a Christian yet get into a cage and battle. The sport then still banned on Network television and the political resistance of it becoming a mainstream sport made acceptance difficult.  This book helps explain how God uses his followers in all areas and aspects of life not just in Church. I have always thought I was used to spread the glory of Jesus and had a captive audience every time I fought. It was an opportunity to spread the Love of Christ in what could be a dark place. A chance to give God the glory for my victorys when the microphone was handed to me, and quote a scripture verse pointing my finger at Jesus and not myself.   Physical Sports such as MMA are no different than going to school as a teacher. Its an opportunity to give God the glory, and profess your love for an awesome God.  The Warrior is one more way we as believers can help others have the piece that we all need. I highly recommend this book to all!&lt;/p&gt;
