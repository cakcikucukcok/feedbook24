  <title>Prophetic Zone of War - Kervin Dieudonne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book, by the grace of God and through the revelation of the Holy Spirit, God will reveal to you Satans identity. You cannot fight what you cannot see; you must know how to fight your enemy. First we are going to study the history of Satan and why he was cast out of heaven. Then we will study the different elements we battle against found in the book of Ephesians. Lastly, we will encounter the different battle styles or techniques to engage into battle according to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read this book I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that deliverance will begin to enter your house, your life and your family; that the fire of God will come upon you. In addition, I pray that God will begin to move in your life in a fresh way. In John 8:32 Jesus says And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free (KJV).&lt;/p&gt;" />
