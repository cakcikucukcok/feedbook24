  <title>Life by Design - Ashaunti-Ra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Designing your life is completely up to you. However, structured belief systems take us away from our soul intentions. Some of us feel that we are pawns in some elaborate chess game being played by deities of choice. We are designed to be the masters of our Universe! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our belief systems determine our experiences; when we actively change those beliefs, we change our experiences! As simple and straightforward as this is it can prove to be difficult for us to orchestrate when we try to implement life changes. We are beautifully complex beings and all areas must be interwoven in order to effect lasting life changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to create an atmosphere of heart-knowing, where our teacher within can connect and work with us. Once connected, we will then have the ability to design and re-design our life, world and affairs  at will and in trust, love and joy.To begin the journey into &quot;heart-knowing&quot;, I have divided this book into three major sections that address core issues or stumbling blocks as it were to our heart-knowing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin your journey into self-actualization you must recognize that you are the co-creator and the deciding factor in your reality and the life you are currently expressing and then you must begin to recognize and then neutralize the emotional blackmailers in your life and finally you are ready to begin a relationship with the Creator of All Things -- a relationship built upon choosing and then anchoring in the Light of the Creator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these steps is foundational on your path to becoming self-actualized and I have provided examples, and affirmations to assist you in re-designing your current belief-systems and self-talk thought processes. As simple and as straight-forward as it is to &quot;choose this day whom you will serve&quot;, our psychological, theological, and sociological &quot;automatic&quot; programming makes the journey interesting to put it mildly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life by Design is about taking back your power in joy, love, compassion and more importantly non-judgmentally. It is a blueprint, a foundation as it were for orchestrating your own life expression. &lt;/p&gt;" />
