  <title>On Rock or Sand? - John Sentamu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The aim of this book is nothing less than to assess and reset the terms of the debate about the kind of nation we want to be. It asks: What are the essential values we need for building a just, sustainable and compassionate society in which all can participate? Chapters by expert economic, political, religious and social thinkers, including contributions by Lord Adonis, Sir Philip Mawer, Oliver O&#39;Donovan, Andrew Sentance, Julia Unwin and Archbishop Justin Welby Addresses crucial questions about the moral principles that undergird the way Britain is governed Written for people of any or no religious background who are concerned about the values that influence our political attitudes and decisions Faced with a period of change as great as that of the 1930s, the continued cohesion of our society is at risk as expectations of ever-rising prosperity are challenged and many struggle to make ends meet. It is within this context that the contributors to this book examine some fundamental questions. How can we draw upon the wellsprings of social solidarity today? What would a new social contract - a new understanding about the respective rights and obligations of the individual citizen and the state - look like today? At a time when budgets and other resources are being reduced, what are the principles we should adopt to distribute them? In short, what values can the Christian faith bring to the table to help address the problems we face today? These and other core questions about the kind of society we seek lie at the heart of this book." />
