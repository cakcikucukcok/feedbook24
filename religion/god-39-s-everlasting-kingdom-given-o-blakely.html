  <title>God&#39;s Everlasting Kingdom - Given O. Blakely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
An in-depth exposition of the person of GOD as viewed through the revelation of His eternal purpose in the Holy Scriptures.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;SUMMARY OF THE BOOK&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
GODs Everlasting Kingdom sets the jewel of redemption with its facets of faith, the Word of God, the Savior, the church, and the knowledge of GOD in the context of GODs person, will, and eternal purpose. The whole of Truth is put into focus and made more understandable. Men of faith are brought into a fellowship of reason with their Maker, which is essential, to our pilgrimage in this world and obtaining our inheritance in the world to come. The believer, as with all things, is of, by, and to GOD.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This is not a book primarily about man and how GOD can be given participation in our lives to make things better for us now. Rather, it is about GOD, who is ruling and reigning according to the councils of His own will, and how we can be adopted into that glorious and eternal purpose to everlasting life and joy.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;THE CENTRAL TOPIC OF THE BOOK&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Who GOD is, what He is doing, and how man relates to it.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;WHAT QUALIFIED BROTHER BLAKELY TO WRITE THIS BOOK?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Faith. Extensive knowledge of the scriptures. Devotion to and exhaustive study in the Word of God for more than fifty-five years. Neither reliance upon nor ignorance of the works of other men of GOD (long deceased and living).
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THE BOOK?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Most books on the topic of Scripture deal with a particular aspect of it, or is confined to specific accounts, personalities, or times. This work looks upon the whole of GODs revelation in reference to Him from the foundation of the world, through the present, into the new heavens and new earth. It explains the realities governing this present world, and shows the reasonableness of making things which are temporal secondary to things eternal. It validates the believer in his assurance of faith and confidence in God.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;FIVE SINGLE WORDS DESCRIBING THIS BOOK&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Fresh, non-sectarian, discerning, intelligent, foundational.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;WHY SHOULD YOU OBTAIN THIS BOOK?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
1. No other book like it (in content and perspective) of which I am aware.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
2. It is written to communicate profound truths in an understandable manner.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;THE PRIORITIES OF THE BOOK&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
1. God Himself. &lt;BR&gt;
2. The eternal purpose of God. &lt;BR&gt;
3. The relationship of Jesus Christ to that purpose. &lt;BR&gt;
4. The relationship of the Word of God to that purpose. &lt;BR&gt;
5. The relationship of man to that purpose.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;WHO WILL PROFIT FROM THIS BOOK?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Theologians, Preachers, Teachers, believers, anyone with a genuine interest in the Holy Bible.

&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS BOOK&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The objective that dictated both the subject and the content of this
volume is the glory of God. His kingdom, like Himself, is great and thus
is apt to be perceived less clearly than is possible. Because the kingdom
of God involves His deliberate dealings with men, it is of particular
importance to them. To neglect the kingdom is to neglect God Himself
while to seek fi rst the kingdom of God is to seek Him primarily.
We cannot think properly about God in separation from His kingdom.
It is related to His objectives, His will, and His person. The law of God,
the grace of God, the salvation of God  all are resident in, and associated
with, the kingdom of God. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

thoughts or that mystifi es Gods person and work contribute" />
