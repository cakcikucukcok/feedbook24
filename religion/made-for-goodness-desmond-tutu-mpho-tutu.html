  <title>Made for Goodness - Desmond Tutu, Mpho Tutu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We know all too well the cruelties, hurts, and hatreds that poison life on our planet. But my daughter and I have come together to write this book because we know that the catalogue of injuries that we can and do inflict on one another is not the whole story of humanity, not by a long measure. We are indeed made for something more. We are made for goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8212;from &lt;em&gt;Made for Goodness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years the same questions get asked of Desmond Tutu, the archbishop, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and veteran of the moral movement that ended apartheid in South Africa: &amp;#34;How can you be so hopeful after witnessing so much evil?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Why are you so sure goodness will triumph in the end?&amp;#34; This book is his answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, more than any other time in history, our world needs this message: that we are made for goodness and it is up to us to live up to our destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognize Archbishop Tutu from the headlines as an inspirational figure who has witnessed some of the world&amp;#39;s most sinister moments and chosen to be an ambassador of reconciliation amid political, diplomatic, and natural disasters. Now, we get a glimpse into his personal spirituality&amp;#8212;and a better understanding of the man behind a lifetime of good works. In this intimate and personal sharing of his heart, written with his daughter, Episcopal priest Mpho Tutu, Tutu engages his reader with touching stories from his own life, as well as grisly memories from his work in the darkest corners of the world. There, amid the darkness, he calls us to hope, to joy, and to claim the goodness that we were made for. Tutu invites us to take on the disciplines of goodness, the practices that are key to finding fulfillment, meaning, and happiness for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
