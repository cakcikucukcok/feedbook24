  <title>Radical Restoration in the Church - Jay R. Leach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ONE GENERATION FROM EXTINCTION! 
There is a drastic shift in the national culture and churches today; which if not countered can make Christ extinct in one generation! In the midst of this shift many Christians have become confused and are blurring their kingdom mission, biblical worldview and life of godliness. Meanwhile, recent research reflects some 2 billion people in the world who have never heard the saving gospel of Jesus Christ; and billions more caught up in false religions. In the shift many Christians individually and corporately are failing in their responsibility to pass on the faith, wisdom, and godly example to the next generation. Failure to do so in one generation will remove Christ and Christianity from the next generation (s). To meet this challenge we must radically restore the faith (see Jude 3) for the final hour: 
Restore [agape] love for God and others in the Church 
Restore and teach a true biblical worldview in the Church 
Restore biblical salvation and a daily walk with Christ in the Church 
Restore total dependence upon the Holy Spirit in the Church 
The secular worldview secures more Christian casualties daily. But by His divine power, God has given us all things that pertain to a life of godliness ..... (see 2 Peter 1:3)." />
