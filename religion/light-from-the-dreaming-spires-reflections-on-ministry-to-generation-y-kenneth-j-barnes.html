  <title>Light from the Dreaming Spires: Reflections on Ministry to Generation Y - Kenneth J. Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just as &quot;generals are always fighting the last war&quot; my experience as a chaplain at Oxford University has taught me that the church often &quot;speaks to the last generation.&quot;  The statistics provided by the Pew Research Center say it all. The people of Generation Y are less likely to go to church, believe in God, or identify themselves as &quot;religious&quot; than any previous generation, yet they still have a deep and abiding interest in &quot;spiritual&quot; things. If the church is going to reach this group of &quot;seekers&quot; with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, it will have to do it on their terms, speak their language, and understand their concerns. If we try to &quot;fight the last war&quot; with Generation Y, we will lose it.   Instead, church leaders must seriously examine how we relate (or not) to Generation Y and change our tactics accordingly. This book is a reflection on my personal experience of ministry to Generation Y, combining pastoral care, mentoring, and &quot;postmodern apologetics&quot; in ways that are equally applicable to parochial, academic, and/or secular settings." />
