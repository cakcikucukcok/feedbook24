  <title>Preaching Romans - Frank J. Matera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Paul&#39;s letter to the Romans is the most theologically charged writing of the New Testament, it is rarely preached from Catholic pulpits. Perhaps some of the Pauline themes? Redemption and sanctification, justification and reconciliation, resurrection and parousia? seem too daunting for homiletic purposes. Not so, insists Frank Matera, who has learned to preach in a Pauline key&quot; that has invigorated the whole of his preaching. Homilists who heretofore have avoided Romans will appreciate Matera&#39;s insights on this text that open innovative and important ways of proclaiming the gospel. This slender volume is a gift to homilists who wish to preach from Romans with greater confidence? And to proclaim Paul&#39;s theologically rich and assuring message of God&#39;s saving grace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Frank J. Matera is the Andrews-Kelly-Ryan Professor of Biblical Studies at the Catholic University of America. A former president of the Catholic Biblical Association of America, he has published commentaries on Romans, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians, and has written books on New Testament Theology, New Testament Christology, and New Testament Ethics. Matera&#39;s previous works published by Liturgical Press include &lt;/i&gt;Galatians&lt;i&gt; in the Sacra Pagina series and &lt;/i&gt;Strategies for Preaching Paul.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
