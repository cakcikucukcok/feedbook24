  <title>The Gospel for the Visual Learner - Leslie C. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Are you a visual learner? Do you more readily understand and remember concepts when they have been graphically illustrated for you? If the answers to these questions are &quot;yes,&quot; then this book is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Gospel for the Visual Learner&lt;/b&gt; vividly illustrates that Christianity exists in an entirely different realm than religion. In addition, the Fork Illustration provides a framework upon which you can visualize not only how you gain entrance into a life of grace, but also how you are called to continually appropriate grace for daily living. In every moment of your life, you are functionally living in one of the three positions represented on the Fork. Understanding what these positions are and how movement is made from one to another is foundational for vital spiritual living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are a non-believer who is unsure of the claims of Biblical Christianity, be encouraged you to read and see if you can locate your position on the Fork. Perhaps you have viewed Christianity as something far different from what Scripture asserts it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are a Christian, be challenged to read and evaluate your functional living in light of these three possible options. It could be that you are self sufficiently living like an adult who needs no help. Perhaps you are defiantly running from your Father. In either case, as you read, ask the Spirit to remind you of your position as God&#39;s dearly loved child.&lt;/p&gt;
