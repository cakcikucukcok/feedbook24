  <title>Wow, Look What God Can Do! - Sharon Dalhouse Carlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These stories are short testimonies of interesting
things that God has done in the lives of various
individuals.Sometimes, these mighty acts seems as strange and
unbelievable as fiction, but it is nothing short of awesome and
amazing when God works mightily through and for us, sometimes
in mysterious ways, other times in plain, easy to understand way,
especially for those who trust him and believe in him.
As you will soon read in the pages coming up, God is a very
present help in trouble.He promises us that he will never leave
us nor forsake us. The devil would have us believe otherwise,
that God doesnt care about us and our lives and he doesnt care
what happens to us, but hes a liar. God is always true to his
words and he will never fail you. If you place your entire trust
in him, it is no secret what God can do, what he done for others
hell do for you and for others around you.
The aim of this book is to help you grow in your faith and
to help you experience a closer, personal relationship with God.
You can never go so far out of his reach that his love cannot
reach you, pick you up and save you.Remember, when you walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, you shall fear no evil,
for Thou art with you, his rod and his staff comforts you. We
hope youll enjoy these amazing testimonies and be blessed." />
