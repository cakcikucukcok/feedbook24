  <title>The Realizationist View of Eschatology - Philip Mark Ames</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the most wicked member of a tribe becomes its ruler, and the most worthless member of a community becomes its leader, and a man is respected through fear of the evil he may do, and leadership is given to people who are unworthy of it, expect the Day of Judgment.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
 The Prophet Muhammad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is based entirely on the Holy Bible and is not a study of Islamic teaching. However, the above quotation seems timely and is not far from what the Bible itself says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This books title has two words unfamiliar to many: Realizationist and Eschatology. The latter is derived from two Greek words, eschatos meaning last things; and logos meaning word, concept, or understanding. So, eschatology is the understanding of last things; the study of endtimes prophecies found in the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Realizationist approaches such a study with a divine assurance that those prophecies were written for the times in which we live, a realization that the last days are unfolding right now in our own generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unique understanding began to be revealed to only a few some 45 years ago. It is now being made available to all who dare to preview the realities of the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
