  <title>So God, Here&#39;s My Plan - Melinda Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why can&#39;t God do things the way we plan?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you walk through some of the toughest challenges that life seems to throw at you, do you find yourself on one emotional rollercoaster ride after another? Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute to think on these statements and see if you identify with any of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Why do things always seem to happen to me?
It really is all about meisn&#39;t it?
I&#39;m not judging you; I just think you&#39;re wrong!
I just can&#39;t ever deal with that because it hurts too much.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these words seem like your own, you are in good company, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join a regular woman who shares her many faults and failures to find out why God must be in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to fight the enemy who sets out daily to destroy your peace and joy. Most of all breathe a huge sigh of relief that you are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is amazing grace to living life every day, safely in the arms of a loving God who really does have a good plan for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read these writings and sometimes they would arrive with comfort, sometimes with a sting, and sometimes humor. But one thing is certain, they always touched my heart. Joan Neal&lt;/p&gt;" />
