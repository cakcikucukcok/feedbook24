  <title>The True Story of Jesus - Gino Paolino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The True Story of Jesus is that his great uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men on the planet, orchestrated the plan to have Jesus crucified and, thereby, fake his death in order to save his life. 
When Jesus was thirteen years old, Joseph of Arimathea took him to Glastonbury, England, to introduce Jesus to the Druids and, thereafter, Joseph of Arimathea arranged for his education in the ancient temples and monasteries of India from age fourteen to twenty-eight. At twenty-nine, Jesus then travelled to Athens, Greece, to study the Eleusinian Mysteries and, thereafter, he journeyed to Glastonbury, England, to complete his studies in the Mysteries of the Druids.
At the age of thirty, Jesus had his final initiation in the Great Pyramid of Giza from which he emerged a Christed Onean enlightened master fully capable of exercising all of his miraculous powers to heal the sick, to cure the blind, to walk on water, to calm the storms, and to manifest out of the ethers. 
After his ritual baptism by his cousin, John, in the Jordan River, Jesus, a royal prince, was then betrothed to Mary Magdalene, a royal princess. Jesus then commenced his ministry and continued to teach and preach and heal and perform his miracles for the next three years until he incurred the wrath of the Temple High Priest. 
When it appeared as though Jesus would be stoned to death for blasphemyhe calls himself the Son of God and, therefore, equal to GodJoseph of Arimathea orchestrated the plan to have Jesus crucified, and he did, indeed, succeed in his plan to fake his death in order to save his life. 
After Jesus survived the Crucifixion, he returned to the temples of India where he had grown up as a youth. Mary Magdalene travelled to France, and then to Glastonbury in England, and then to Wales where she gave birth to their daughter, Sarah, and established a home where Jesus often visited her.
Jesus would continue to teach and preach and heal and perform his miracles throughout Persia, India, Nepal, Tibet, and Kashmir  where he was known as St. Issa and revered as a holy man, a prophet, and a saintuntil he transcended to the heavenly realms at the age of 83, and his body was buried in Srinagar in India." />
