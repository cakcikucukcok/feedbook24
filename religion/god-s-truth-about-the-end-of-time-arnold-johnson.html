  <title>God’S Truth About the End of Time - Arnold Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arnold makes no claim to be anyone special, but just an avid bible student. When it comes to bible prophecy, he doesnt believe anyone is more qualified than another. Arnold has a passion for Bible prophecy, and he knows he is not alone. His studies began when he first read the Book of Revelation over 35 years ago, and has been studying it ever since.
His book, Gods Truth About the End of Time, is different from anything you have read before, and a must read for anyone interested in this time period. Most people know about the destruction that takes place, but it is so much more. This book shows us that this time period is Gods design, and must take place in its proper order.
Arnold has divided this book into three parts. The first part is a detailed explanation of the Book of Revelation. Once you finish this part, you will be able to read through the Book of Revelation, and understand it.
The second part gives the reader the timeline for the events that take place. Some of the events included in this part, is the return of Jesus, what Satan will do when he is cast out of heaven, how the rapture takes place, and of course the destruction and wars.
The third part of this book is a paraphrased unsealed version of the Book of Daniel. Inside this part you will understand the continuous timeline prophecy from Ancient Babylon to the end of time as we know it. This book also gives us some specific dates, such as when Jesus is to return, the nuclear war, and when the end of the world takes place.
Arnold currently resides in Lincoln, Nebraska with his wife, son, and two cats. While working on this book, he work at his job during the day, but during his evenings and weekends he would study end time prophecy, which is his hobby and passion. He wrote this book to share with others what he has discovered in his 35 years of study." />
