  <title>Love: Expressed - Tristan Sherwin, Jonathan Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You may be looking at the back of this book, watching as someone else is reading ita book entitled: Love: Expressed. And youre thinking, They must have issues. So to help them out for a moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isnt another one of those self-help manuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isnt a book about romance and sex, or feelings and cuddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isnt a guidebook offering relationship advice, giving tips on how to find love and look after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those senses, this isnt even a book about love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a book about lifeevery part of it. About how it should be lived, how it should be explored, how it should be expressed. This is a book about meaning, about lifes trajectories. Its about God. Its about you. Its about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, this is all about love. But if I could capture here what I mean by love in that sense, I wouldnt have needed to write a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tristan Sherwin has written a smart and beautiful book showing us that Jesus Christ is the love of God expressed as a human life. This is the life we are called to imitate; this life of love is what we are made for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Zahnd; Author of A Farewell To Mars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshing, authentic, inspiring, and yet practicalTristan is a breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Lucas; Author, Speaker, Broadcaster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love: Expressed is a work of dirt-under-your-fingers spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Martin; Author of Prototype&lt;/p&gt;" />
