  <title>Letters to the Lord from the Soul of Jermaine Reaves - Jermaine Reaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We never know where life will take us, and sometimes we must spend time in the darkness before God shows us the light. For Jermaine Reaves, a ten-year prison sentence would become a time of deep revelation and anointing by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Letters to the Lord from the Soul of Jermaine Reaves, author Jermaine Reaves shares his personal letters to God, which he wrote while coming to terms with his time in prison and his newfound Christian journey. Jermaine realized that God was using this time for him to be led by the Holy Spirit and find healingboth for himself and for those around him. And whether he was facing struggles in prison or with his family, Jermaine would learn how to endure and rely on the blessings of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian journey can have obstacles and challenges along the way, but God always shows us direction and offers us guidancewe have to only listen and watch for his signs and his revelations. Join Jermaine on his unique and difficult walk to find the guidance and salvation that only God and Christ can provide, and be inspired by the miraculous and compassionate ways of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
