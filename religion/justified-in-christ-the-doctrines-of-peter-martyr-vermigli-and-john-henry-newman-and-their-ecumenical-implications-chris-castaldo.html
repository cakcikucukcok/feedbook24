  <title>Justified in Christ: The Doctrines of Peter Martyr Vermigli and John Henry Newman and Their Ecumenical Implications - Chris Castaldo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Analyzing and comparing the doctrines of justification held by a legendary nineteenth-century Catholic, John Henry Newman, and an Italian hero of the Reformation, Peter Martyr Vermigli, this book uncovers abiding opportunities, as well as obstacles at the Catholic-Protestant divide. These earnest scholars of the faith were both converts, moving in opposite directions across that divide, and, as a result, speak to us with an extraordinary degree of credibility and insight.  In addition to advancing scholarship on several issues associated with Newman&#39;s and Vermigli&#39;s doctrines, and illuminating reasons and attendant circumstances for conversion across the Tiber, the overall conclusions of this study offer a broader range of soteriological possibilities to ecumenical dialogue among Roman Catholics and Reformed Protestants by clarifying the common ground to which both traditions may lay claim." />
