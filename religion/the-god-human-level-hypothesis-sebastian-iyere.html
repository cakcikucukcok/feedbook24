  <title>The God-Human Level Hypothesis - Sebastian Iyere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE GOD-HUMAN LEVEL HYPOTHESIS, an illuminating book by IYERE Sebastian, attempts to share a simple and uncomplicated understanding of the Bible and life in general, using a simple model. 
The book presents the human being living simultaneously in two worlds (seen and unseen), with consciousness trapped in this seen world. It explains that there is something out there that controls us all from the unseen world. It submits that the five-dimensional human nature (HEART being thread-like (Ecc.12:6) connecting the SPIRIT and the SOUL; SOUL attached to the FLESH with another thread-like MIGHT) is disconnected and disjointed. Whereas a full understanding will be gained at the end of time or after death (when consciousness is liberated), there is a need today to consider reconnecting to God and recombining the five-dimensions. The connector or plug is Jesus Christ.  
This literary piece reinforces the authenticity and infallibility of Gods word. A coalescence of science, geography and history. While poignantly projecting the Sovereignty of God, the book depicts as sheer insanity, any attempt for anyone to think he/she is in control of anything in this world. The book touches every aspect of life (physical, spiritual, psychological, emotional, and so forth) in a microscopic dimension." />
