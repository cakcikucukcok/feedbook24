  <title>Plain Truth - Todd D. Utley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Plain Truth
For many generations modern Christians have sat in church week after week while ministers pound the pulpits telling them what horrible sinners they are. In many cases doctrines have been handed down from parents to children, professor to student, and pastor to assistant, with little or no study of the scriptures on a personal basis. It should come as no surprise that we are missing some important pieces.
If you are ready for real growth then you should read the Bible for yourself and fi nd out what it says to you fi rst hand. Reading this book you have in your hand is a good place to start. In this book we will explore provocative truths that you may not have heard of before. We will look at topics the average minister will rarely if ever speak of. We will discuss things that the protestant church simply cannot accept in spite of it being right in front of them in black and white and even in red and white. We will also look at a few scientifi c discoveries that support the word and spark our imaginations.
Christ came to set us free from the bondage of the old law, yet many churches today are riddled with legalism, bickering, envy, hate, all the things that contradict what Christ came to promote, that being love and forgiveness. Christ himself said that he came into the world not to condemn it but instead to save it and to give each person eternal life.
Plain Truth is a fresh look at some of the most interesting scriptures on the most controversial topics. I have shared it with the world in an effort to promote the Kingdom of God along with peace and personal growth for those that seek it.
I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I have enjoyed creating it. It may not be inspirational on every point to every reader, but if it helps each reader discover even one small truth for them, then my mission is accomplished.
