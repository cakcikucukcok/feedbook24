  <title>Pilgrim People - Clifford M. Yeary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean today to be part of a people whose very identity is rooted in the belief that they belong to God and that their lives are a pilgrimage of faith?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pilgrim People&lt;/i&gt; is a journey through Scripture that examines how the call of God has led the faithful in both Old and New Testaments to regard themselves as pilgrims. God&#39;s call sometimes leads and sometimes sends, and the destinations can be new and wondrous or even dark and dangerous. But it is not the destination that transforms biblical journeys into pilgrimages. Instead, just as it was for people of Scripture, our footsteps are set in the right direction when we discover that God is our companion on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers will encounter major landmarks of salvation history, al examined with insightful research and sprinkled with lively reflections on the contemporary call to every Christian to follow God as a faithful pilgrim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Clifford M. Yeary is the associate director of Little Rock Scripture Study, for which he writes and revises study materials and presents wrap-up lectures. He holds a master&#39;s in pastoral studies and a BA in Old Testament literature. He is also associate editor of &lt;/i&gt;A Year of Sundays&lt;i&gt; and has contributed to &lt;/i&gt;The Bible Today, &lt;i&gt;both published by Liturgical Press.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littlerockscripture.org/en/Detal.aspx?
