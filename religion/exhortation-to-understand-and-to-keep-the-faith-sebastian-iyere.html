  <title>Exhortation to Understand and to Keep the Faith - Sebastian Iyere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The section on DEVELOPING THE RIGHT PERSONALITY FOR A LASTING RELATIONSHIP looks at the role of personality in finding a partner and in living with one. It discusses who is ready in spirit before marriage and living together after marriage. The questions below are answered, amongst many others:
How should we decide whom to marry?
Do we have enough moral strength to treat everyone equally, including our subordinates and the less privileged?
Are we ready for marriage? If not, should we wait until we are ready?
How do we treat ideas and suggestions from other people,regardless of our pride?
Do we still think that we can get all we need by power and might?
Are we ready for the chores and skills involved in keeping a home?
As wives, are we ready to submit to authority?
As husbands, can we love selflessly?
Have we kept long-time or childhood friendships?
The section on QUESTIONS ABOUT MONEY IN THE CHURCH attempts to answer one question at a time from our set of questions:What is a tithe?
Who pays a tithe?
To whom is a tithe paid?
When do we pay a tithe?
What is the content of a tithe?
What is the role of the one who receives a tithe?
The final section, WILL HE FIND FAITH ON THE EARTH WHEN HE RETURNS, sums up the role of Christians in society. It attempts to shed light on how we are meant to live in this world as we wait for His coming. 
Why are we as Christians not taken away to heaven straight away? 
Why are we exposed to the daily struggles of life when we can go to bliss? 
Why will he not bring us into the many mansions in the Fathers house?" />
