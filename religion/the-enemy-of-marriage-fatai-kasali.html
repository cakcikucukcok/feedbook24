  <title>The Enemy of Marriage - Fatai Kasali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?&amp;rdquo; Genesis 3:1. Genesis 3 shows that the first satanic attack recorded in the Bible was against marriage. Luring Eve into disobedience to God would have split a sinful Eve from a sinless Adam. As it turned out, both fell. Since then, Satan has been working against the success of marriage by exploiting the weaknesses of the partners to cause crises in their marriage. If you have a marital crisis, you will need to identify where Satan has become involved. For your marriage to stand, you will need to be conscious of the devil&amp;rsquo;s schemes. Satan is the real enemy of marriage; it is not your spouse, or any other human being. But the weaknesses in your spouse or yourself might have given him the opportunity to mess with the affairs of your home. This book will educate you about Satan&amp;rsquo;s warfare against marriage and how to deal with it. May God bless your marriage abundantly as you read this book in Jesus name.&lt;/p&gt;" />
