  <title>Overcoming Obstacles in Your Walk with God - Cynthia Ousley-Garey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Obstacles stand between you and God, and they are imperfections that can weaken your mind, body, soul, and spirit. So how do we avoid or overcome these obstacles when they are trying to destroy the very temple that God wants to build up? How do we stay true to the path of divine purpose while not being discouraged by the many obstacles in all their shapes, forms, and sizes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming Obstacles in Your Walk with God is designed to help you grow mentally, physically, and spiritually by teaching you how to let God take total control over your life. Whether there are obstacles in your relationships, in your career, or even in your faith, Christ assured us the power and the strength to overcome any obstacle. But we must turn to the Word and let God see us through if we want to know how to endure the storms of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting God take total control starts with you, and once you believe his Word and start applying it to your life, then you will see how God helps you overcome the obstacles on his ordained path. So dont get discouraged along the way, and even through betrayal, mistreatment, and failures, knowing who you are in Christ will lead you on a road of success, positivity, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
