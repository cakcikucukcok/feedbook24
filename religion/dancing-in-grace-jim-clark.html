  <title>Dancing in Grace - Jim Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Experience the Lord of the dance!
Lets be real: while life in Christ is filled with riches for the soul, there are also many challenges as we walk through this broken world toward our heavenly home:
		Coping with unanswered prayer
		Being wounded by loved ones
		Feeling no longer needed
		Longing for freedom from legalism
During thirty years of ministry, Jim Clark has encountered stories of Christ-followers who faced innumerable challenges and yet found joy, freedom, and a deep purpose as they put their lives in the hands of Jesus. Jim takes you on a journey of these fellow pilgrims during which youll witness the intersection of tough obstacles with a powerful, yet tender Savior. Youll learn of the wife who forgave deeply from the heart, the addict who became a pastor to those seeking recovery, the elderly who found purpose through service, and the man who preached a sermon at his own funeral. 
Its a journey that can inspire you to face your own obstacles and challenges with faith, hope, and joy in the Holy Spirit. You just might find yourself dancing as you experience more of Gods amazing grace.
Real stories about real people  living, struggling and growing in their faith in Jesus Christ. This is what Jim Clark brings to life. Its a must-read for anyone interested in a timeless treasure of encouraging stories of faith. 
-Merlin Mann, Professor of Journalism,
Arkansas Tech University
This is a great book about an even greater hope. Its a profound call to embrace Gods incredible capacity to heal, forgive and love.
