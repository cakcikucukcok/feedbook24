  <title>Memoirs of a Sojourner - Rog Gryder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;ver the span of fi fty fi ve years, beginning at age eight, I have
investigated many religions. I have read Islams Quran cover-tocover,
as well as the Catholic apocrypha, in which the book of
Susanna touches my heart dearly. I have read the Book of Mormon coverto-
cover and it, too, touched my heart. I have been lured by the grace of
Hindus and Buddhists to ponder their beliefs. Yet, I do not consider these to
be a part of the preserved Word of God. Only the Biblical teachings of Jesus
Christ explain to me where my spirit came from. It tells me what I did to fall
from Gods grace, why I am on this planet, and why I need pardon greater
than I can obtain myself. Jesus Christ has provided the Way and no other
book explains it as does the Holy Bible. Th e Bible gives me healthy hope to
carry on with gusto. As of the year 2010, I have read the King James Holy
Bible cover-to-cover more than twenty fi ve times. Th is ongoing reading, of
the preserved Word of God, is the only credential I claim and stand fi rmly
upon. Biblical faith is not blind, but anchored securely in observable science.
I am a nuts-and-bolts, up to my elbows in grease, kind of gear head. I want to
know what makes it tick! Th e Authorized Holy Bible is the repair manual
for life, for dummies! It explains the mysteries of Gods kingdom in detail to
those who read it all very carefully. I have not arrived. My sojourn in this
far country called earth is still in motion. However, we are at the threshold
of major global events, as never before seen by man. Th ese events are all
foretold in Gods preserved written Word. Hence, my reading of Th e Holy
Bible is my only credential, and I have a passion for sharing what I have
found! May you be blessed eternally as you journey with me the corridors
of life that are not limited by time and space. May the Lord add His blessing
to the reading of His entire Word. Amen. Rog" />
