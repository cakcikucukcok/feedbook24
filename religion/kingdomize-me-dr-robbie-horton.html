  <title>Kingdomize Me! - Dr. Robbie Horton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kingdomize Me reveals kingdom living  that God, through Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit is establishing Kingdomization of Gods Kingdom on Earth. This book will establish or strengthen an understanding of processing, perfecting, transitioning and tranforming Gods people to be kingdomized. The aim of kingdomization is for new birth, heirship and sonship. As citizens of Gods eternal kingdom here on earth, we will be kingdomized before He returns for His people. From civilization to kingdomization includes kingdomizing a people for spiritual subjection for specified service, duties, actions and deeds. The processing and perfecting is for accountability to God.
A kingdomized life is a life of priorities where daily kingdom living with righteousness are the procedures and developing for a press for a persevering relationship with God and His word. As believers of great responsibility, accountability and credibility to a precious knowledge of Christ, God and the Holy Spirit and the kingdom of God, and as workmen, of workmanship of the Holy Spirit and of the kingdom of God, every transition is a setup for Gods transaction and for kingdomizing us. 
The purpose of this book is to crack the code of the mysteries of God. Its contents include God and His kingdom, to show us what word level we are on; the power of God vs. the powers that be; won over to win; and the mystery of kingdomization." />
