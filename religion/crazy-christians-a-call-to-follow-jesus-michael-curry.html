  <title>Crazy Christians: A Call to Follow Jesus - Michael Curry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;We need some Christians who are as crazy as the Lord. Crazy enough to love like Jesus, to give like Jesus, to forgive like Jesus, to do justice, love mercy, walk humbly with God- like Jesus. Crazy enough to dare to change the world from the nightmare it often is into something close to the dream that God dreams for it. And for those who would follow him, those who would be his disciples, those who would live as and be the people of the Way? It might come as a shock, but they are called to craziness.&quot; -from Bishop Curry&#39;s &quot;Crazy Christians&quot; address to the 2012 General Convention of the Episcopal Church in Indianapolis" />
