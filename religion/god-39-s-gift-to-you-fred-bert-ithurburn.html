  <title>God&#39;s Gift to You - Fred Bert Ithurburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 
The book contains copies of over 150 letters that the Catholic lay author wrote to Pope Benedict XVI expressing his constructive criticism of his Church&#39;s Eucharist, a contention that it overlooks Jonah&#39;s sign to carry the message of Jesus to the unmindful world; and, due to the non-response of his spiritual leaders has forced the author to express the good-news concerning this retained Gift of God directly to all members of the Church of Christ, made up of all people created, to whom it is given. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The contention being made was also that of the Catholic New Testament scholars after the Second Vatican Council who claimed the Catholic Church&#39;s Eucharist cannot be conditioned upon anything, neither baptism nor serious sinfulness, since everyone in the world is invited by Jesus Christ to the banquet. However, based on the 1968 opinion of Fr. Joseph Ratzinger, who felt it contradicted his biblical findings, the Church&#39;s Eucharist continues to be maintained, as it had traditionally been distributed pre-Vatican II, to exclude most every human being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following Jesus&#39; sign of Jonah, God&#39;s good news concerning the Catholic Church&#39;s Eucharist is hereby going global (see Luke 11:30-32 - reluctant Jonah was forced to save outsiders) to inform everyone of their invitation by God to consume of God&#39;s lifesaving heavenly meal. The author&#39;s dispute having been unresolved by his spiritual shepherds, and members of his church, has caused the author to take the issue in contention to everyone on earth as members of the body of the Church of Christ. Thus, informed, anyone created who wishes to accept their gift from God is free to share our Eucharist and gain its mysteriously divine benefits.
