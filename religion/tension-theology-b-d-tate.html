  <title>Tension Theology - B.D.Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about the tension revealed in scripture. Our efforts to systematically understand spiritual truth have often meant removing the tensions found in the Bible. We sometimes ignore passages we dont like or understand in order to make things fit together. We practice, to our harm, the either/or response to most of these conflicting biblical issues. When we remove the tensions present in scripture, well find ourselves to the right or the left, instead of being on the straight and narrow road that leads us to life in His grace.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we remove the tension found in scripture (and there is a lot of it), we end up creating more tension between each other.  As we embrace both sides of the spiritual revelations regarding any subject, the answers will come. The tension provides safety, balance, protection, and keeps us in a place to receive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I address the problem, present the theology of tension, and begin to apply it to many familiar, but often controversial, doctrines. Amazing answers are revealed not by choosing sides, but by affirming both, even when our natural minds cannot discern them. In essence, we short circuit the purpose provided by these tensions when we dismiss them. The tension is in the scriptures: we need to live in it and remain in grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
