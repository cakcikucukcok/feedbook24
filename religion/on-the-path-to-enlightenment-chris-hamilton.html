  <title>On the Path to Enlightenment - Chris Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the Path to Enlightenment: A Hope for Humanity seeks to provide insight into the purpose of life. Author Chris Hamilton explains that it is the lessons we are learning in our everyday lives that define our lifes purpose. These lessons give us hope to move forward into the light through love, releasing fear and judgment as we find peace and listen to our inner voice. We also realise that we do have help in our daily life through the guidance we are each given on a daily basis. We were born to experience life in all its many facetsto find love and to live that love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From personal tragedy in Chriss life comes a warm story of understanding our spiritual side through this guidance and ultimately finding peace and forgiveness. She has received what she believes to be divine guidance over a period of time, some of which was channelled to uplift her in times of sadness, doubt, or frustration. She feels it has been given, not for her alone, but for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our planet moves towards a higher dimension, we, mankind, must move forward with it if we are to remain on the earth in our physical forms. On the Path to Enlightenment seeks to help us make that move. Profound and uplifting, this book by Chris Hamilton has grown from a long study of esoteric knowledge, channelled guidance, and personal tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
