  <title>God Is Always There: Psalms for Every Moment - Kathleen Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every moment of life if a gift from God-yet, as humans we experience love, loss, grief, gain, joy, sadness, anger, fear, excitement and other such emotions. God is Always There: Psalms for Every Moment reminds the reader that the presence of God is everywhere, and our encounter with the Lord is most concretely experienced in our ordinary daily lives.  In Scripture, the prayer of the Psalmist embraces the human experiences of suffering, ecstasy and everything in between. Atkinson writes &quot;it&#39;s not that life is made of distinct times of sorrow and times of joy; it&#39;s that life simultaneously holds both sorrow and joy in a creative tension that can only find description in symbolic expression: in art, music, poetry, and dance.&quot;  In this book, the author invites you to experience the Psalms, viewing them through the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. Experience anew these ancient hymns of lament and praise, and remind yourself that God truly is always there." />
