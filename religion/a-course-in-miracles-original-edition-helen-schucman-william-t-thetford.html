  <title>A Course In Miracles (Original Edition) - Helen Schucman, William T. Thetford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The great classic work, A Course in Miracles, is devoted to  teachings about who we are, our relationships to God and with each other, and  the actually mental nature of our bodies and the world. There are three  constituent parts to the Course: The Text, a Workbook for Students, and the  Manual for Teachers. The Text lays out the theoretical foundation for the  metaphysical system of the Course. The Workbook contains a series of 365  Lessons to be practiced daily for the purpose of retraining the mind and  healing our perception. Finally, the Manual contains information for and about  advanced teachers of God. A Course in Miracles is also about miracles, which  students understand to be, in part, a shift in perception to healed vision.  But miracles are more than a shift in perception, because the shift has  consequences in the world as we see it. The conversational tone of this  Original Edition invites the novice student into conversation with the Author,  and even advanced students of A Course in Miracles have found a new clarity  and a deeper understanding from their study of the Original Edition of the  Course. The restoration of the previously lost material and presentation of  the text in its original sequence enlivens the conversation with the Author  and gives him a presence that some feel is lacking in the later editions. When  encountering Schucman and ThetfordÃ¢â?¬â?¢s original edition, students  frequently find fresh clarity as they read its wording or new understanding.  Surely study of the Original Edition is essential to your curriculum.  " />
