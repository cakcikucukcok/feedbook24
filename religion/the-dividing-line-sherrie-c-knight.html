  <title>The Dividing Line - Sherrie C. Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Solomon states in Proverbs 23:23, Buy the truth, and do not sell it. Also wisdom and instruction and understanding
Proverbs 19:8 says, He who gets wisdom loves his soul; He who keeps understanding will find good.
In The Dividing Line; The difference between Discernment and Deception,  it is my desire to give everyone an understanding of the importance of discernment, and deception. Discernment is very critical to the way we make choices. As soon as we get up in the morning, we are making decisions; it is important to make these decisions wisely.
We can choose to start our day by seeking the Lord or take the day for granted and chance the consequences. This is the same with the other areas of our lives and those we have to make decisions for. Why not be more thought-provocative when doing so? It may be the difference between victory and defeat. 
I hope that all who read The Dividing Line; The Difference between Discernment and Deception will come to a place of new revelation and allow it to change their unwanted and unwise situations." />
