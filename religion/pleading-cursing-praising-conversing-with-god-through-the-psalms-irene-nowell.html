The fact that she is al three makes her an extraordinary resource for Christians today. In &lt;I&gt;Pleading, Cursing, Praising&lt;/I&gt;, Nowell puts al of these gifts to use to offer a guide to praying with the psalms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nowell maintains that the psalms teach us to tell our story, to cry out our pain, and to give praise to God. They also teach us to listen - to the voice of God, the voice of Christ, the voices of the people around us, and the voice of al creation. This book includes questions and exercises for personal reflection, brief prayers for praying along the way, and suggestions for composing one&amp;#39;s own psalm-prayers.
