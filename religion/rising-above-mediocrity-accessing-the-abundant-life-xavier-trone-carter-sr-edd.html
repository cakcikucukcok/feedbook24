  <title>Rising Above Mediocrity, Accessing the Abundant Life: - Xavier Trone Carter Sr. EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In addition to In His Own Image: Understanding and Enjoying the Full Complement of Salvation, Dr. Carter has also written and is in the process of publishing Rising above Mediocrity, Accessing the Abundant Life: Taking Christian Practices to the Next Level. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In Rising above Mediocrity, Accessing the Abundant Life, Dr. Carter endeavors to delineate a not-to-well-known procedural process that leads to significant spiritual growth and development. As a friend and colleague, I too believe that its insights will be profitable for those who have an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the organized Church. Dr. Carter is correct when he says, People would do better if they knew better, even if they dont agree with him. However, as one who is in total agreement, I believe he has done a masterful job of describing and delineating a verbal portrait of the person, the presence, and the power of the all-knowing, all-powerful, all-seeing, and ever-present God of creation. These publications reflect the experiences and exposure of this author while on the road to repentance and regeneration. &lt;/p&gt;
