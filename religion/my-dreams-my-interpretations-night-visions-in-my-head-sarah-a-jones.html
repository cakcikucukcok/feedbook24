  <title>My Dreams, My Interpretations: Night Visions in My Head - Sarah A. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;If youre ready to hear from God, if youre ready to be blessed, then you must read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;What has God told you to do through dreams, visions, and in His Word that you havent finished or havent started doing yet? Well, now is the time to do all that God has told you to do, because night is coming, and no one will be able to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;God started showing author Sarah A. Jones dreams at the age of sixteen. He began speaking to her several years ago about writing this book, saying that it would be a blessing to all people as they read it. Men and women of God have also told her that God shows her dreams, He wants her to write a book, and people would be blessed as they read it. All of her dreams in this book are given by God and Jesus Christ, and her interpretations are revealed and inspired by God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This book will inspire you, inform, encourage, and strengthen you; it will build your faith and richly bless the body of Jesus Christ and everyone who reads this book in faith with expectation to hear from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Writing this bookgetting it published and into your handshas not been an easy task. Satan has fought Sarah every step of the way, because he didnt want you to read this book and be blessed by God. But what God has for you is for you; only you can hinder or stop your blessings. Sarah thanks God, who gives us the victory, for she has completed this part of the work He has given her to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This book is for you. Find yourself in these pages, for God has a special word and blessing just for you. Open your mind, your heart, and your ears. Believe, receive, and listen attentively and expectedly, as God speaks, blesses, and reveals His wonderful plan and purpose for your life. Jesus loves you, knows your situation, and wants to minister to you personallyone on one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
