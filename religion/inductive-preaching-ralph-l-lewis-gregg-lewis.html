  <title>Inductive Preaching - Ralph L. Lewis, Gregg Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I spend hours in my study and on my knees preparing sermons, but when I preach them no one listens. What&#39;s wrong? Why aren&#39;t I getting through? Why do I see blank stares, daydream reveries, nodding heads as soon as I open my mouth to preach? I know my messages are biblically sound. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m preaching what God has laid on my heart. But it&#39;s not being received. What&#39;s wrong? What can I do?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? If you&#39;re a preacher, you probably know the feeling. But it doesn&#39;t have to be that way. You can learn to preach in a way that will be readily, even eagerly, received by your congregation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all here: what inductive preaching is, how it works, why it&#39;s effective, who&#39;s used it--including Jesus, Peter, Paul, Augustine, St. Francis, Wesley, Edwards, and Moody, to name only a few. Also included are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Step-by-step guidelines for constructing an inductive sermon&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Two sample inductive sermons&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A list of 96 inductive preachers from 20 centuries&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A strategy for making traditional sermon structures inductive&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A checklist of inductive characteristics.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The principles in this book can dramatically increase your sermon effectiveness--turn apathy into involvement, make listeners out of the listless. Inductive preaching is preaching that &lt;em&gt;works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Thoroughly and convincingly sets forth the case for inductive preaching.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; --James W. Cox, Professor of Christian Preaching, Southern Baptist Seminary&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Will be a real service for anyone wishing to convince modern man about the gospel--a resource for all of us who preach and teach for years to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; --Jay Kesler, President of Youth for Christ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I have read many books on preaching during my 34 years of teaching the subject. This is one of the first which I have read from beginning to end without stopping. If you plan to preach next Sunday you had better read this book today.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; --Lloyd M. Perry, Director, Doctor of Ministry Program, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School&lt;/p&gt;" />
