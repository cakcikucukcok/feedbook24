  <title>A Life of Grace - Grace Baldonado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A journey of faith. Trusting God to direct me, because I knew that my first assignment would be traveling to a country at war. I had lived in an Islamic country at war prior to knowing Christ, and at first I was reluctant to accept the assignment. Later on, I realized that when I was younger, I was being prepared for what lay ahead. It was amazing that as a single woman, I was sent to live in an Islamic country, Iraq, the cradle of civilization . When I visited biblical sites such as Babylon, Hatra, and Jacob&#39;s well, it brought the Old Testament alive. And to travel to the sites of the seven churches of the book of Revelation and other sites that the apostle Paul traveled, I found that a life yielded to Christ can be interesting and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;" />
