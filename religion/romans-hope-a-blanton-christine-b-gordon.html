  <title>Romans - Hope A Blanton, Christine B Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a woman who feels like you don&amp;#39;t have time to study the Bible in a deep and meaningful way, this is the book for you. Romans is a combination of Chris&amp;#39;s ability to unpack scripture in deep, practical ways and Hope&amp;#39;s ability to create questions that guide the reader and apply God&amp;#39;s word. Designed to be completed in just twenty minutes, each study is both substantive and time efficient and is useful for individual and group studies. -- What Others are Saying: &amp;quot;This Bible study is a helpful and fruitful guide to the book of Romans. I was impressed with both the depth and insight of this study as well as its accessibility and readability. This study demonstrates careful and sound exegesis of Romans along with practical insight and application of Paul&amp;#39;s teaching. The questions throughout help the reader to connect with and apply the scripture both to their heart and personal story. This book will ignite both the mind and heart to continue to grow in their love for the Lord and his word. I heartily endorse this wonderful resource for those who desire to study Romans in a deep, meaningful, and practical way.&amp;quot; -Mark Pf&amp;uuml;tze, Ph.D., M.Div., LPC, assistant professor of practical theology and counseling, Covenant Theological Seminary &amp;quot;I felt God&amp;#39;s heart for women jumping off the page. The questions brought out a rich balance of biblical history and emotional responses to God&amp;#39;s Spirit at work. It was a joy to delve deeply into the word of God in a framework compatible to the life and responsibilities of a woman.&amp;quot; -Heidi Faulkner, missionary for Campus Crusade for Christ &amp;quot;I appreciate the combination of historical context, current application, emotional honesty, and connection to personal story. I love the use of the words like &amp;#39;hurt&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;scared&amp;#39; in the reflection questions as it draws out the truth and messiness of our emotional experience in our relationship with God. These studies have depth of richness and authenticity while being brief and attainable for women who have full lives and yet are committed to study the Bible.&amp;quot; -Stephenie Craig, LCSW, pastor&amp;#39;s wife and therapist &amp;quot;This study does exactly what a Bible study should-it calls the student to read and think on their own, then walks through the text with clarity and precision. Tackling Romans is a big, important task, and from what I&amp;#39;ve seen, readers will leave this study with a solid, first-hand knowledge of the text-the measuring stick we should use when evaluating any new study.&amp;quot; -Kristi James, Acquisitions Editor for P&amp;amp;R Books Christine B. Gordon, MATS, is wife to Michael, who is an ordained PCA pastor, and mother of three. She earned her master of arts in theological studies at Covenant Seminary. When she has time she loves to sleep, walk, and sew, in that order. Hope A. Blanton, MSW, is wife to Ray and mother of three. She earned her master&amp;#39;s in clinical social work at Temple University. Currently she works as the women&amp;#39;s ministry equipper at Redeemer PCA of Lincoln, Nebraska. She loves good food, making people laugh, and being outside.&lt;/p&gt;" />
