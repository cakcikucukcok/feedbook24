  <title>Selective Belief - Roland Crevier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DO YOU HAVE AN OLD HAT FAITH?
Is the Bible simply a book that confirms what we already believe, or instead is our belief to be conformed to what is written in the book?  Even the Gospel can become old hat to those who take their faith for granted. Selective Belief is written with a fresh look into what we think we already know about salvation and Gods grace. The love of God for the sinners whom He saves is a story that never grows old.  It is an eternal love story that we gladly tell to all who will listen.
This book stems from many encounters with those who see Gods only purpose as a sinner- saver.  To many of these, this is the sole purpose for His existence.  God is greater than this. He reigns in a glorious Kingdom where He currently rules as King.  He has a Universe to manage, and a fallen world to bring to its ultimate conclusion.  We will discover a God who is on the midst of working His eternal plan.  In this eternal plan He graciously chooses to include as His own children people from the humanity of this earth to become heirs to His Kingdom and to become the recipients of His eternal blessings. 
This book will cause you to take a fresh look into the scriptures regarding Gods choices regarding our salvation, as well as the process by which He brings it to come to pass in our life.  It will challenge you to take another look into what you thought you already knew about your salvation." />
