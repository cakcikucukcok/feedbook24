Moses was bold and courageous to use his God-given privilege as he deemed fit and to the best of his interest and that of his loved ones. Maybe, God gave His designated representatives in any generation that privilege because fundamentally, He had meant man to take charge of the earth on His behalf as long as man obeyed Him. If so, then Moses was still in order as far as God was concerned." />
