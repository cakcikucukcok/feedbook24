  <title>Living Portraits of Grace - Donald A. Broadwater</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book considers the presence and ministry of the Holy Spirit as he transforms the cracked canvases of our lives into becoming living portraits of grace.  Jesus did this with his disciples while he was here on earth and his Spirit continues to do this now that Jesus has ascended to heaven.  Once we realize just how committed God is to paint grace in our lives we discover fresh hope.  We may have thought that we would have to figure out the Christian life on our own.  But now we discover that God has never left us alone at all.  In fact his Spirit&#39;s work in us has guaranteed that the portrait he is painting will reflect his presence forever!  We also realize that there are countless others who have also been called to be part of God&#39;s living portrait.  He is painting in all nations on the earth and one day believers will join the hosts of heaven who have cheered us on since God first took up his brush to paint in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
