  <title>Digging Your Own Well - Jacquelene Hurlburt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jacquelene has spent years taking note of what she has learned.  She wrote her book because of her love for the Lord and desire to teach others how to live a joyful Christian life that bears fruit bringing glory to our Lord.  Spiritual vitamins are examples of solutions taken from the Bible to handle every day trials that have been around since sin entered the world. The excerpts listed below are only three of the 31 Jacquelene discusses.  She has had firsthand experience with successfully applying what she learned from the Word of God.Are we angry with God because of our present situation?  Are we angry because someone has mistreated us?  Are we angry because of the injustice of an unfavorable court decision?  Are we justifying our anger by our thinking that God wants us to teach others a lesson?  Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of malicious behavior.  Ephesians 4:31.  
Sometimes we are offended by the remarks from these others, and the offense is even more difficult to handle when we know it was a deliberate act.  Where do we even begin to start working our way through the complexity of loving people we find difficult?  The answer is simple--the Holy Spirit teaches and enables us to do this.  He teaches us to move beyond the hurt and pain of the offense and to conquer evil by doing good.  Dont let evil get the best of you, but conquer evil by doing well.  Romans 12:21.
From the start to the finish line, we need to utilize Gods power.  We are not to be like those who choose to sit on the bleachers and criticize.  Is the race always an easy one?  No!  There may be many bumps in the road; but our dedication, determination, perseverance, and love for Jesus  will help us run across the finish line as a winner for Him!  . . .dont let this bad example influence you.  Follow only what is good. . .  III John 1:11." />
