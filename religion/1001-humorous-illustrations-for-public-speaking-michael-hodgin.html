  <title>1001 Humorous Illustrations for Public Speaking - Michael Hodgin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have something important to say. Are you sure your audience is listening? Clocks start ticking in the minds of your listeners the minute you begin your presentation.  These clocks measure the amount of time you have to interest them before their attention wanders elsewhere.  Could be three minutes. Could be thirty seconds. But make your audience laugh and they forget about their clocks. They are too busy listening. Make them laugh and they will listen. Humor is one of your most powerful tools as a speaker, and 1001 Humorous Illustrations for Public Speaking lets you wield it with power. Michael Hodgin has compiled hundreds of humorous anecdotes on dozens of topics and brought them together in one book. From &quot;Ability&quot; and &quot;Accidents&quot; to &quot;Work&quot; and &quot;Worship,&quot; Hodgin&#39;s illustrations are arranged according to topic and indexed to help you quickly find the perfect anecdote.  The book also provides space to record the times and places you use each illustration, so no one will hear you tell the same joke twice. Ideal for preachers, teachers, executives, and anyone else who speaks publicly, 1001 Humorous Illustrations for Public Speaking will keep your audience laughing -- and listening to every word you say." />
