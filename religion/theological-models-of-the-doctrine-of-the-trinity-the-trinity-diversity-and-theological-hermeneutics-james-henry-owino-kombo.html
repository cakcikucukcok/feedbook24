  <title>Theological Models of the Doctrine of the Trinity: The Trinity, Diversity and Theological Hermeneutics - James Henry Owino Kombo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The doctrine of the Trinity is the foundational doctrine for all Christian theology, doxology and practice. In this publication James Kombo brings a unique and valuable contribution to understanding the Trinity and how God can be understood within the context of any culture and language.  Kombo first recognizes and brings into focus God&#39;s self-presentation in Scripture as the triune God. Moving from the early church through various church traditions over the centuries, he interacts with how each tradition viewed God and their interpretation of the Trinity. Closing with a distinctly African view of God from the Luo language tradition, used mostly in Kenya and Tanzania, Kombo emphasises the benefits of considering alternative models of interpretation from various regions of the world. Kombo&#39;s work applying his research across cultures makes this an excellent resource in any context of ministry and the academy." />
