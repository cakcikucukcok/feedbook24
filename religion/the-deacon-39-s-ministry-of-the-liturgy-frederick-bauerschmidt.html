  <title>The Deacon&#39;s Ministry of the Liturgy - Frederick Bauerschmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Deacon&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of the Liturgy&lt;/I&gt; offers a concise and accessible introduction to the liturgical aspects of the ministry of the diaconate. The book covers not only the practical side of liturgical ministry&amp;mdash;what the deacon does in various liturgical celebrations&amp;mdash;but also roots of that ministry in Scripture and tradition, as well as reflecting on the role of the liturgy in the spiritual life of the deacon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The Deacon&amp;rsquo;s Ministry series explores the three fundamental diaconal ministries identified in the teaching of Vatican II: those of the liturgy, of the word, and of charity to the people of God (&lt;I&gt;Lumen Gentium&lt;/I&gt; 29). This series, written by three highly regarded permanent deacons, offers a rich combination of theology, spirituality, and practical and effective guidance. Deacons and those in diaconal formation, their families, the bishops and priests they work with, and the people they serve will welcome it.&lt;/div&gt;" />
