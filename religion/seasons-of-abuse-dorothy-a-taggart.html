  <title>Seasons of Abuse - Dorothy A. Taggart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In every poem written an interpretation of a dream, nightmare, or reality remains to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tayas reality was that she lived in an abusive relationship over a decade, which was not a dream, instead it was a nightmare. She lived the nightmare and faced the reality of abuse early in life, nevertheless her dreams came true later in her life.&lt;br&gt;
As the seasons changed her emotions changed with expressions of love, hate, depression, and fear. While God sent his grace, wisdom, love, and joy down from heaven-Taya embraced his gifts in the rain, sunshine, wind, and snow.&lt;br&gt;
Without the fear of what people might think, Taya was able to express her true self by expressing her true feelings throughout her stories and poems. There is a message in her poems and stories, which will remain in hearts and minds forever.&lt;br&gt;
While her emotions traveled deep into her words-her tears bled with the hopes that every word in this book would reach every hurting soul that needs healing.&lt;br&gt;
Living in an environment surrounded around drugs, violence, and crime did not prevent Tayas dreams from coming true. For she was able to reach out to God with the confidence that he would carry her through all her trials and tribulations, which she experienced in life.&lt;br&gt;
Her poems describe her world, so she would like to invite you to see life through her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
