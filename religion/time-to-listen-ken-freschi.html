  <title>Time to Listen - Ken Freschi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Time to Listen&lt;/i&gt; author Ken Freschi continues to share messages that he has channeled since 2009. Our awareness and acceptance of our Divine connection is critical to understanding why challenges present themselves in our lives. Where Kens first book, Our Walk to Eternity, leaves off, the messages of peace, love, and hope, intertwined with his everyday experiences, gives readers an inside view as to what life is all about. Kens willingness to leave his comfort zone and share what he has been gifted has been a source of peace, comfort, and confirmation for those open enough to embrace the messages brought forth from beyond the veil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time to Listen&lt;/i&gt; will instill in us the hope, peace, and joy that is lacking when we are presented with the inevitable challenges of life in this world. Through the words of the Divine, the reader will gain the clarity, the acceptance, and the understanding that are key to living a joyful and fulfilled life. You are much more than the person looking back in the mirror. Open your mind and heart to who you truly are.&lt;/p&gt;" />
