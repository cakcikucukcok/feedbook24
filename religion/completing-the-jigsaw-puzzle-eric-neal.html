  <title>Completing The Jigsaw Puzzle - Eric Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eric Neal was always curious about God and religion, but it all seemed rather confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was until he met someone who became a lifelong friend. Through the special gem of information his friend shared with him, things started to make sense, and set him on a new path of discovery. In this book, Eric describes his spiritual journey, arriving at a destination he was beginning to believe didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. He says many people start on the same journey, but fail to reach their destination, because they are more focused on the road blocks than the signposts. In his book Eric removes many of the obstacles in the hope that many more people can arrive at a destination which provides true spiritual fulfilment in the same way that he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who doubts the existence of God, or needs some clarity around the whole subject of religion, this book is a &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;must read&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more interesting reading and feedback, please visit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.completingthejigsaw.com&quot;&gt;www.completingthejigsaw.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
