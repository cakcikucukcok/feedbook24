  <title>Jesus Paid the Price - Gene Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Remember, the one who pays the price for something is the one who determines the value of what it is they are purchasing. Jesus paid for you with His suffering, pain, death, and blood; therefore, He values you more than His own life, and God values you even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel According to Matthew was written by a former tax collector. They were men with deserved reputations for being ruthless thieves, despised by all. A tax collectors income was largely created by overtaxation, bribery, and underhanded dealings. The very fact that Jesus used such a man to be part of a team that completely transformed the world for all time should be of great consolation for all of us who have fallen short. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
My prayer for you as you read this book would be that you understand the love, grace, mercy, and commitment Jesus and our God has for you. I believe that in doing so, you will fall in love with Him as I and countless others have. You will leave your guilt behind, finding hope, peace, joy, love, and acceptance in Christ and walking in a freedom such as you have never known.&lt;/p&gt;" />
