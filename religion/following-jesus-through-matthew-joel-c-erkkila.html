  <title>Following Jesus Through Matthew - Joel C Erkkila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our world is undergoing a massive cultural shift from the safety of modernity into the unknown wilderness of what is next. Christianity has been caught up in this cultural vacuum and is struggling to stay true to its calling. All that the church has held dear is now been called into question. Where does a faithful follower of Jesus turn to in such troubled times? &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer is, of course, the Word of God, but it is not that simple. Much of what we have been taught and experienced as biblical teaching has been tainted with reductionist concepts, born in modernity. There is a need to reinterpret the teachings of Jesus and seek a renewed understanding of what He meant when He said, Follow Me. This book is an attempt to call people to rethink the gospel of Matthew and hear Jesus with fresh ears. It uses devotional thoughts to help the reader reflect on what Jesus is really saying, and it provides space for the voice of the Holy Spirit to renew our minds so we can live a life worthy of our calling as Christs ones.&lt;p&gt;" />
