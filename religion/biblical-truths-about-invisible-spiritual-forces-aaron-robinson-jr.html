      <meta name="description" content="Discover &#39;Why&#39; There is So Much Hatred and Violence in the World and What We can do About it!   What can explain the many &#39;bad deeds&#39;, happening in the world today, both major and minor, that we see or hear about almost daily, either in person or in the media? Or, why seemingly ordinary people are doing all the &#39;bad&#39;, even &#39;shocking things&#39; that they are doing? Could it be something in the &#39;air&#39;, the &#39;water&#39;, or maybe something entirely different altogether that&#39;s behind all the bad that goes on in this world everyday.  The scriptures tell us that it&#39;s something that a lot of people are not even aware of, or do not believe, as you are about to discover... This bible study guide will show you exactly what the Holy Scriptures teach about the &#39;Invisible Spiritual Forces&#39;, that influence the lives of people everyday, their &#39;base of operations&#39;, and how we are instructed to interact with the &#39;good&#39; ones and &#39;deal&#39; with the &#39;bad&#39; ones (get rid of them)." />
