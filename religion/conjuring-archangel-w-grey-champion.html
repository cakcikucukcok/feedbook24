      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conjuring Archangel&lt;/i&gt;: Chronicle of a Journey on the Path offers itself as a drink of cool water to the thirsty traveler making his or her way through arid terrain of the modern world. In a conversation between a woman and Archangelthe spirit who guides herthis book-length dialogue offers insights that open the precepts and practices of Buddhism to the earnest seeker for meaning. This approach provides guidance to any who wander lifes landscape amid the peaks of modern sciences nihilism and the valleys of religions discredited superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W. Grey Champion relies upon his own powerful spiritual inclinations and his love of writing to bring the voices in this text to life. Mixing these elements provides the inspiration for crafting the chronicle of a womans daily meditations and her nightly discussions with Archangel. As the blossoming conversation both informs and instructs, the exchanges become at times inspirational, devotional, humorous, and even sensual, while a charming relationship between master and student slowly emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find your own thoughts and ruminations turning to fundamental questions. Do I have a soul that leaves my body when I die? Can I experience the timeless state through my own meditation? Why do good people suffer? If questions like these speak to you, then &lt;i&gt;Conjuring Archangel&lt;/i&gt;: Chronicle of a Journey on the Path will contribute to your enlightenment, whether you already embrace Buddhism or you simply are seeking an authentic spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
