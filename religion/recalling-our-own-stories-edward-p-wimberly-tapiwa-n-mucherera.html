  <title>Recalling Our Own Stories - Edward P. Wimberly, Tapiwa N. Mucherera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How religious caregivers can find spiritual renewal in their own story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Recalling Our Own Stories&lt;/i&gt;, which author Edward P. Wimberly describes as &quot;a spiritual retreat in book form,&quot; is designed to help clergy and religious caregivers face the challenges of ministry. It is also a valuable resource for practitioners who assist these clergy and caregivers in meeting the challenges of their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wimberly enables caregivers to map out and come to grips with cultural expectations of their profession. He also helps readers explore and edit the mythologies that make up their self-image, attitudes toward others, expectations about their performance and role, and convictions about ministry. Finally, he provides a model for spiritual and emotional review grounded in narrative psychology and spiritual approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Wimberly explains, this book offers a way to renew our motivation for ministry by reconnecting to our original call, visualizing again how God has acted and remains intricately involved in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wimberly demonstrates how religious caregivers, often facing burnout, can tap the sources of renewal that reside in the faith community.&lt;/p&gt;" />
