  <title>Going Deeper - J. Sidlow Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going Deeper &lt;/em&gt;is a priceless book on deep and precious spiritual matters, written by a deep and discerning thinker. Though the author is known internationally as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s foremost Bible expositors, here the emphasis is not on the study of the text of Scripture, but on the practical application of its message in victorious Christian living. It is not knowing about Christ, but knowing Him, and performing a spiritual service of being as well as doing which leads to complete surrender to a sovereign Christ, says Dr. Baxter. When many an exciting but transient issue of today has been forgotten, the deep spiritual realities dealt with in the three areas of this spiritual classic will live on with imperishable significance, as will the reverent, scholarly exposition of them in this rich and rewarding volume. Knowing, loving, and serving our Lord Jesus Christ - the greatest of these is loving, for it is the outcome of intimate communion, and the reward of obedience, and responsiveness to the calls of duty. To know Him is to love Him, and to love Him is to serve Him in utter loyalty and devotion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
