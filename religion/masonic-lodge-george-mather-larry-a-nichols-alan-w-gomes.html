  <title>Masonic Lodge - George Mather, Larry A. Nichols, Alan W. Gomes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many make the mistake of thinking because a thing is common, it is probably harmless. Masonic Temples are everywhere. Are the Masons just another &quot;service organization&quot;? Though their rites are secret, Masons assure others that their practices are totally compatible with Christianity. But there is an injunction to each Mason to practice &quot;his particular religious creed, that revelation of the Deity which is recognized by his religion.&quot; What really goes on behind the Temple door? Here is a discerning, detailed response. -- Why this series? This is an age when countless groups and movements, old and new, mark the religious landscape in our culture, leaving many people confused or uncertain in their search for spiritual truth and meaning. Because few people have the time or opportunity to research these movements fully, these books provide essential information and insights for their spiritual journeys. Each book has five sections: - A concise introduction to the group - An overview of the group&#39;s theology -- in its own words - Tips for witnessing effectively to members of the group - A bibliography with sources for further study - A comparison chart that shows the essential differences between biblical Christianity and the group -- The writers of these volumes are well qualified to present clear and reliable information and help us discern religious truth from falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
