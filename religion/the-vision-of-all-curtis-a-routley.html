  <title>The Vision of All - Curtis A. Routley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Vision Of All is the first book to contain a sequential flow of Bible Prophecy. It does not contain the doctrines and traditions of men. Reanalyzing the foundational scriptures for the doctrine of the revival of the Roman Empire; it asks the one question whose answer completely destroys the doctrine and leads to the identity given by the Lord Himself: the King of Assyria who will be the ruler of the union of Syria and Iraq. You see, native born Roman citizens did not destroy the temple, Jerusalem, and the nation of Israel. The Lord Himself said (Isaiah 7:14-20) that Assyrians and Egyptians would do this job after the son was born of the virgin. Since the word of the Lord is true, Assyrians and Egyptians came to do the job. Were they Roman soldiers when they came? Yes they were. The Roman General Titus used the Tenth Fretensis from Damascus, Syria, and the Fifteenth Appolonaris from Alexandria, Egypt. Were they Roman citizens when they came? Yes they were, but only by means of draft inducement. Goodby revival of the Roman Empire. Hello, King of Assyria.
The second Lord Himself passage likewise does away with the doctrine of Rapture Next theology.
(1 Thessalonians 4:13-18) Verses 16 and 17 clearly read the catching up follows the dead in Christ rising first. So the answer to the question of When does the Rapture occur? was always easy, it was after the Resurrection. Martha knew the resurrection took place on the last day.(John 11:22-24) Even the Lord said He would raise them up on the last day. (John 6:38-40) I do not believe the Lord God of Creation was confused about what He said; so end your confusion and believe what He said. Then prophecy is simple." />
