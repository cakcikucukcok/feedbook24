  <title>Little White Church in the Vale - Bonnie Watkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Small-town living and faith come alive in the experiences and personalities of life in the tiny dairy farm community of Addicks, Texas. Let your mind wander back to a simpler time as you read poetry inspired by life in a small Methodist church.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In &lt;i&gt; Little White Church in the Vale&lt;/i&gt;, author Bonnie Watkins recalls her childhood in Addicks and paints a picture of her life in the community. In brilliant details, she describes the stained glass windows in her church, the gardenia bushes outside, and even what it felt like to wear her hair in pincurls on Saturday night in preparation for church on Sunday morning. Black-and-white photographs of small Texas churches tell stories for themselves, bringing another dimension to Watkins words.
&lt;br&gt;
Whether youre from a big city or a farming community, youll find inspiration and refreshment for your soul in &lt;i&gt; Little White Church in the Vale&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Advanced Praise for Little White Church in the Vale: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You can almost feel yourself sitting in the pews and watching the congregation of this small town church. &lt;br&gt;
PJ Pierce, author of &lt;i&gt; Let me tell you what I&#39;ve learned&quot;: Texas Wisewomen Speak&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bonnie has brilliantly captured the charm, beauty, culture and even humor embodied in the rural congregation. You&#39;ll be reminded of the simplicity of country living and the transcendence of faith while you feel like youre looking at a Norman Rockwell painting.
