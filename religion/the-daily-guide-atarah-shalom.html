  <title>The Daily Guide - Atarah Shalom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Included in The Daily Guide is everything you need to be guided in your day to day walk with God in His Word; thats why the book is called what it is! Interested in spending more time in prayer? Open it to the prayer section and begin to develop a closer dialog with God. If youre curious about what the Word says about your identity in Christ, depression or other topics, theres a devotional for exactly the challenge youre facing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, Paul was on the road to Damascus when he saw a bright light and heard the voice of God. Those traveling with him saw the light, but did not hear Gods voice. You may see the light of Gods Word written, but can you hear the voice behind it? Your ability to hear from God is crucial to experiencing success, deliverance and manifestations. The Daily Guide is designed for you to not only hear, but have confidence in the voice of God.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 29:1-5 says that when you hear and obey the voice of God, there are no obstacles that can stand in your way. The Bible is Gods Word that came from His voice. You must know Gods written Word in order to understand His spoken Word. This is why The Daily Guide is filled with the Word of God, but reading the scriptures alone wont bring deliverance, results or manifestation. The Daily Guide is meant to give you understanding and clarity of the Word of God, which is the door that leads you into the secret things of God. When you meditate on the Word, God will speak.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like Paul, when you hear the voice of God and dont just see the light, your life will change forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
