  <title>The Radical Teaching of Jesus: A Teacher Full of Grace and Truth: An Inquiry for Thoughtful Seekers - Duncan S. Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Radical Teaching of Jesus carefully and thoughtfully invites the reader into an understanding of the life and teachings of Jesus. Both his life and teachings are radical in that Jesus intended those who observed his life and heard his teachings to make a major change in their lives by fully receiving the power and presence of God. The implications of this transformation would result in a life of loving God with heart and mind and one&#39;s neighbor without condition.   This volume underlines that to have a full understanding of the implications of the radical teaching of Jesus requires a careful reading of the history--of the Gospel records, of the circumstances in which Jesus lived, and of Jesus&#39; sense of vocation. This understanding makes possible a more credible and nuanced grasp of the style and content of the life and teaching of Jesus and its extraordinary relevance for our rapidly changing and troubled global context.  The book speaks poignantly both to those within the Christian family who find traditional categories regarding Jesus increasingly difficult to affirm, and to those of other faith traditions or religious unaffiliated who seek an authentic spiritual way." />
