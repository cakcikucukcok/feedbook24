  <title>The Storyteller - Kathryn S. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over the years, a myriad of authors have used fiction as a vehicle through which they seek to illuminate major biblical events and deepen the understanding of the role of pivotal individuals within the Bible. However, never before have we seen events and characters portrayed as such through the eyes, ears and commentary of the Chosen Creatures of the Renewing who serve as witnesses to all that transpires. Part fantasy, part allegory, this imaginative tale will draw you into a world that will captivate and intrigue you. The Storyteller takes the reader through the purity and innocence of those days in the Garden, to the Fall of Man with its devastating effects, not only upon Adam and Eve, but upon all of creation, to the conflicts and struggles that engulf humanity as all find that they can no longer readily hear the voice of the Storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come join the majestic Lion, Judah, as he leads the others to the hidden valley that stands outside the ruined Garden. There under the Great Tree, guarded by the Beautiful and Terrible Creature with the flaming sword, you will meet the delightful Honeybee, the gentle Lamb, the wise Ram, and the stubborn Donkey along with the others. See a world you had no idea existed come alive before your very eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opening this book, expect not simply to read, but instead to embark upon a journey that will take you into the heart, mind, and soul of the men, women, and creatures of the Storytellers hand. You will meet the Storytellers enemy, the Dark One, in the form of the beast who enters into a horrific battle with David. You will watch Noah and his wife and family share an experience never before documented in the annals of men. And you will fall in love with the animals and the understanding that they bring to life as it was and will be. Take a journey of hope that will lead you with certainty to your own place of Renewal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
