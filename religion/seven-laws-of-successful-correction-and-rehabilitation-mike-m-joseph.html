  <title>Seven Laws of Successful Correction and Rehabilitation - Mike M. Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its a troubled world we live in.  It was meant to be utopia, yet we are busy messing it up.  At all levels of government we seem to do our best to throw a monkey wrench at the system we devised for our good, not our own hurt.  The legislators are ever busy opposing each other, yet expect to run the day-to-day affairs smoothly.  The American fathers of the constitution chose the least of evil of all forms of government, but the element of human nature seems to make it, at best, a dysfunctional system on many levels.  Without an agreed upon system of values, accepted by all members of society, its impossible to run a smooth government as it is prerequisite for the function of life.   
Since education is the basis that determines the outcome of life, we shall concentrate on this dimension that leads to either success or failure in all areas.  To begin our search for the causes that create a utopian society, we shall address first roll of the parents, especially the mother, in the success or failure of a human beings.  Next, we shall go to the school system  the surrogate parent  and examine its roll in molding the young plants  our children.  Finally, we shall address the roll of the society at large.  In these three areas we shall find the causes of success and failures of life.  Then, we shall proceed to the solutions that will insure the way to success in all areas  the dreamed of utopia. 
Utopia is possible!  We dont have to be ridden with the ills of society, with crime, with violence, with wars, with political corruption.  In the beginning it was not so, in the end it can, and will, be different  if we are willing to submit to the process of re-education, all is possible." />
