  <title>I Don&#39;t Go to Church - David E. Bish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maybe youre a part of the great majority of people in the world who dont go to church. Or maybe you used to go to church and you dont go anymore. You may even be the person who is going to church and walking away every time feeling worse than when you came, or wondering what the point was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if your idea of church is flawed? What if the thing youre staying away from, the thing you decided to leave, or any collection of bad experiences is actually a false impression of what Jesus and his church are really all about? And what if you realized that although Jesus started this thing called the church and is in charge of it, Jesus never actually said that you are supposed to go to church? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus never said to go to church. But he did say that he would build his church, and he did say that his followers would be his church. Thats right: Jesus invites you to follow him and to never go to church again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if youre open to giving church another chance or seeing it for what Jesus always intended for it to be, then prepare to discover within these pages what you may have been missingbut looking forall along.&lt;/p&gt;" />
