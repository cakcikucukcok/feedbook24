  <title>The Prayer of the Oppressed - Hamza Yusuf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Power of this prayer of Imam Muhammad al-Dar&amp;rsquo;i lies in its simplicity, its purity, and its sincere supplication. It is essentially a plea to God that our transgressions be overlooked, that divine mercy be bestowed upon us, that social justice be restored in spite of us, that wrongs be righted, and that righteousness reign once again in our lands, so that the destitute may no longer be in need, the young may be educated, the animals&amp;rsquo; purpose fulfilled, rain restored, and bounties poured forth. It is a plea to be freed from the aggression of foreigners in lands over which they have no right&amp;mdash;a plea much needed in our modern world, rampant as it is with invasions and territorial occupations. Ultimately, it asks not that our enemies be destroyed, but simply that their plots, and the harm they cause, be halted. Its essence is mercy, which in turn is the essence of the Messenger of God, Muhammad (peace and blessing of God be upon him): &amp;ldquo;And We have only sent you as a mercy to all the worlds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
