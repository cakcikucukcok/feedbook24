  <title>Black + Red = White - Laura Russell Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son: in whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 1:1214&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 51:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this collection of writings is to show each of us our need for a Savior. And that Savior is Jesus Christ. He alone is the way, the truth, and the life. No man comes to the Father but by Him. Through these words God shows us the blackness of our sins. Then He shows us the forgiveness and cleansing of our sins through the shed blood of His Son, Jesus Christ. When we come to Christ, confessing our sins and asking for forgiveness, He covers us with His blood. The result of this is that we are made white as snow! My prayer for those who are already His is that we all continue seeking cleansing when we fall back into sin. He loves us too much to let us walk in darkness. As we do this we will walk in the light, and that light is white! My prayer for those who read these words and have not come to Jesus for forgiveness and cleansing through His shed blood is that you would hear God calling you to His way of salvation, only through the shed blood of His Son. Hear His heart as He yearns to save you from your sins. Today is the day of salvation! Heed His call. Give Him your heart. If you do, you will no longer walk in darkness. You will walk in the Light. You will walk in freedom, for whom the Son sets free is free indeed! As a result, your journey with Jesus will have begun. Your life will never be the same again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O, taste and see that the Lord is good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 34:8&lt;/p&gt;" />
