  <title>Halo - Gary Proietti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Father Madsen told him, Go to all of the dances, kiss a girl.  And then if God wants you, He will call you.&lt;br&gt;
   Young Glen Romani was destined and determined to become a much loved and respected parish priest, like Father Madsen.  The thought of it occupied nearly every waking moment as he strove to live a life worthy of this sacred calling.  Glens love for God and his commitment to the holy Catholic Church were far beyond reproach. &lt;br&gt;
   But something happened to Glen on his way to the altarlife.  His fast-track to the priesthood made an abrupt and unscheduled stop.  Sadness, bitter disappointment and resentment took hold of Wednesdays Child, shattered his rock-solid religious foundation and finally brought him to his knees.  Glen lost his faith in God, his family and all of mankind, except for oneMelissa Laurien, the love of his life. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
See if true love can in fact save the soul of the man who was said to wear a HALO. &lt;br&gt;" />
