  <title>Christianity Revisited - Kerry Kyriakou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The Kingdom is Coming&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When God created the heavens and the earth He planned it with wisdom and understanding. He saw everything He had made and it was very good. Did God then not foresee what Adam and Eve would do? Most Christians throughout the ages have believed that we would have been far better off if Adam and Eve had not disobeyed God and eaten the fruit of the &amp;lsquo;Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil&amp;rsquo;. Nothing could be further from the truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;font color=orange&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Christianity Revisited&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; is a Christian handbook revisiting some truly important, but little understood, Christian teaching. The next major anticipated Christian event is the Rapture and it is vital that Christians are informed and prepared because Jesus said He will come as a thief in the night, and judging by world event this time may be closer than we realize.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;font color=orange&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Christianity Revisited&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; begins in the book of Genesis and works through the scriptures to the book of Revelation giving clarity and some deep insights on selected topics along the way. Special emphasis is given on Genesis, Israel, Jesus, the importance of the cross, the soon coming End of the Age, The Great Tribulation, The Millennium, and the Great Judgment.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christian author, &amp;lt;font color=orange&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Kerry Kyriakou&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; was called by God to write this book and to reveal what Christians throughout the ages have overlooked. Beginning in the book of Genesis Kerry reveals from scripture why Adam&amp;rsquo;s sin was not a disaster but a blessing and a trigger that set in motion an extended hidden complex plan that would solve the problem of sin and evil forever and make eternal life available to all humanity in what will become the most unimaginably beautiful, prosperous, and joyful eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
