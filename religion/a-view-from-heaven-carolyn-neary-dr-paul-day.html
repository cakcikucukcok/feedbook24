  <title>A View from Heaven - Carolyn Neary, Dr. Paul Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a unique combination of written pictures, artwork, music and devotional reflections that draw us to a view beyond the earthy veil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book A View from Heaven opens our hearts to the deeper realization that God still continues to point us to a deeper relationship with Him through Jesus Christ by sharing His stories from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God desires to talk to us and show us views from heaven even more than we long to see them. This book invites the reader to boldly grab hold of the heavenly promise that when we seek for Him with all our heart, we will find Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank God for Carolyn Neary and the gift she is to the body of Christ! She has an anointing to hear from heaven and to release the word of the Lord that brings churches together and sets the people free! You will want to purchase this beautiful devotional that describes her many heavenly downloads and visitations. Each section is prefaced with the exquisite artwork of renowned artist Linda Lee, who captures Carolyns words with her drawings. And if that wasnt enough, each section includes a link to heavenly inspired music by renowned artist, composer and arranger, Jon Day that brings the stories alive in unexpected ways. And each section is then followed with a thought-provoking devotional written by counselor, public speaker, and teacher, Paul Day, PhD! This wonderful book is designed for those who want more than the superficial. A View From Heaven will awaken the senses of your heart to the much more revelation of the Father! Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian and Candice Simmons, The Passion Translation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book A View From Heaven is creative and unique is so many ways. Carolyn Neary, Linda Lee, Jon Day and Dr. Paul Day have done a wonderful job of using their gifts to point people to Jesus through this book. I personally love the picture with the story titled Alabaster Jar and its activations. I am proud of this team for following their hearts and passions. May all who read this book be inspired to fall more in love with Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
