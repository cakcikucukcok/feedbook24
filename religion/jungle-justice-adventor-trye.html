  <title>Jungle Justice - Adventor Trye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Where do we find justice and freedom in our world today? We believe that justice and freedom can be found on earth through the sensitive leadership of our leaders. Next to God, our leaders are given the responsibilities to safeguard our lives and properties. With that in mind, this book, &lt;I &gt;Jungle Justice&lt;/I&gt;, presents the dramatic account of a certain insensitive leadership. The author created an imaginary state called &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Dubli&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Kingdom&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; that symbolizes some third world nations. A self-styled leader called Blamah maliciously got into power with the aim of bringing justice and freedom to his people. Instead of delivering the goods he promised, Blamah and his admirers terrorized the sub-region for decades. He abused the dignity of humanity, and executed many former leaders, citizens and destroyed the nation beyond a century of its existence. The land became the biggest undeveloped global village. He isolated himself from other world leaders. In fact, he considered anyone who advised him as his number one enemy.&lt;SPAN &gt;  &lt;/SPAN&gt;Many people went into exile in the search of freedom and a better life.&lt;SPAN &gt;   &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;While Blamah was carrying on his genocidal activities, and the widespread crime of ethnic cleansing against nations in the sub-region, a liberator named Leila became the redeeming leader. He was the most successful and wisest leader who ever ruled &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Dubli&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Kingdom&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;. He stabilized and minimized corruption, and eased crimes in the kingdom. He reconciled the nation with other nations. Leila called his form of government, the assembly democracy. With this form of government, decision-making was in the hands of every citizen, and any approved decision was presented to the national government for implementation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P &gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Dubli&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt;Kingdom&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;SPAN &gt; rapidly developed to meet international standard through the many projects undertaken by the leading government, investors and entrepreneurs.&lt;SPAN &gt;  &lt;/SPAN&gt;No one could easily notice that the land was once devastated, and jungle justice was erased.&lt;SPAN &gt;                                                  &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
