  <title>The Blessed Virgin Mary in England Vol. 1 - Anthony Josemaria Fti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;O Blessed Confidence, O Safe Refuge, Mother of God and Our Mother!&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
St. Anselm of Canterbury (1033?1109), Doctor of the Church&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;What is not generally known and only infrequently studied is the role of Our Lady over the centuries as a catechist: teacher of the faith, in a very real sense, primary teacher because she is Mother of God and Mother of the Church and faithful   If any one factor might be singled out for the very high level of faith and religious practice in medieval &#39;merry England&#39; (merry, because Mary&#39;s dowry, because consecrated to Mary as her possession and property) it is this Marian catechesis.&lt;/br&gt;
Only when England deliberately rejected Mary did it cease to be the happy place it once was. Unfortunately, English colonization of other peoples took place only after the repudiation of Mary by England. That is why this catechetical work is especially valuable for the faithful and those who are seeking faith in America and other English speaking cultures. It will bring to their attention precisely what is central to catechetics and so often missing, the presence of Mary, Mother and Teacher. It will make perfectly clear why we need not fewer Marian sanctuaries, but many, many more in all parts of the country where this quiet, but so real and profound influence of the Marian principle of the Church will be felt at every level.&lt;/br&gt;
It is my prayer and hope that those who read and study this work will find the same inspiration and stimulus that I found in having the privilege to read the manuscript before publication. We are much indebted to Brother Anthony Josemaria Pasquale, a Franciscan Tertiary of the Immaculate and gifted scholar, for the effort he has expended to find qualified contributors and to offer so well edited a book to the general public.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
