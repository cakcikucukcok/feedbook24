  <title>Your God Is Your Belly! - R. Frederick Capitolin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book teaches us about the science and benefits of fastingthe art of giving the belly a vacation. Fasting is defined in two words: Eat nothing. Fasting disconnects us from the natural and plugs us into the supernatural. It operates best as a three-man tag-team with loving, giving, and prayerfully seeking God. Fasting is humility. It is the draw near to God, the resist the devil and he will flee, the mounting up with wings like eagles, the run and not be weary, and the walk and not faint.
Those who have mastered the art of denying their body and nourishing their spirit are the Bibles history makers. They are the poor in spirit, the meek, they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, and those who know their God and do exploits. Indeed, fasters are the Moseses, the Elijahs, the Esthers, the Daniels, the Jobs, the Johns, and the Jesuses.
Fasting crucifies the flesh and destroys doubt and double-mindedness.
Fasting is the science of putting new wine into new container.
Fasting has its myths, methods, and motives.
Fasting must be held as a priority, with purpose, power, and pleasure.
Fasting has its how, when, where, and why.
Fasting is beneficial to the entire person,
Physical, mental, marital, medical, financial, emotional, and spiritual.
You know you need to Fast when 
You are in a Fight
You have lost Focus
You need Fervency
You need an increase in Faith
You need Favor.
Fasting will help in the curing of diseases, the casting out of demons, and the reversing of
the aging process.
This kind comes out by nothing but prayer and fasting." />
