  <title>For Those of Us Waiting on That Day! - Ann Dillon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anyone that has had a loved one go home knows the pain and sorrow that can overwhelm them. The loss of a loved one can send you into a deep abyss of pain and sorrow. Do you wonder where your loved one is? What is he or she doing? What is Heaven like? How do you find comfort in the pain? Where is God when it hurts? This book was written as the author found herself asking the same questions when, while still grieving the loss of her dad, her strong, healthy husband had a sudden heart attack. On November 2, 2011, her husband of thirty-eight years was called home to heaven. Trying to hold on to her faith while reeling from shock and grief, she threw herself into studying Gods Word and holding on to her faith while she tried to seek answers and comfort. Being unable to find a devotional that was specifically for grieving Christians lead her to write her first book. You will find comfort and assurance that you will be reunited with your loved one in the scripturally based devotions as you read what God has laid on her heart. Ann gives you a daily devotional that helps you focus on heaven, Gods sovereignty and everlasting love, eternity, and that glorious day we will be reunited with our loved ones, and help you find comfort and an eternal perspective as you wait on that day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
