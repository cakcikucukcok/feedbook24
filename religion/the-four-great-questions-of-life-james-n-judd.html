  <title>The Four Great Questions of Life - James N. Judd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Rare is the person who, at some time or another, has not found himself/herself pondering one or more of the four great questions of life  Who am I? Where did I come from What is my purpose? And, Where am I going? Such questions invariably arise when there is some crisis in ones personal affairs, but due to the emotional confusion that usually accompanies such crises it is difficult to reason out answers to such profound metaphysical questions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Answers appear in the worlds religions, but there is such a variance of opinion between the different theologies that trying to find a definitive solution among all of those divergent teachings only develops more confusion. There is, however, a common inner or mystical foundation to all religions  that supports their man-made dogmas, creeds and rituals  which provides the clear answers all of us are looking for.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	This consistency and enduring nature of the ideas that form this foundation or ground of religion has resulted in those ideas being collectively referred to as the Perennial Philosophy of mysticism. There can be some difficulty, however, in finding the answers within this Perennial Philosophy because the concepts are metaphysical in nature; and this means they are beyond the range of our normal linear way of thinking and, so, not readily obvious. They are, so to speak, locked-up, and a key is needed for us to be able to discover their wisdom.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	In this book, The Four Great Questions of Life, Dr. Judd provides that key and,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Clearly shows where these answers appear in various religious teachings&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Uses down-to-earth illustrations to explain what they mean&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Shows the universal application of the ideas embodied in the Christian Trinity&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Describes how the Law of Karma (cause/effect) and Reincarnation are compatible with Christianity&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Provides a logical explanation and definition that removes the mystery of the nature of good and evil.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	For anyone who has ever struggled to find any meaning in such questions as, Who am I? What is my purpose in living? and so on, this book offers clear-cut and practical answers which, irrespective of ones religious background, show the way to a happy and fulfilling life. &lt;/P&gt;" />
