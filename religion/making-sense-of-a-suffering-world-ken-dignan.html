  <title>Making Sense of a Suffering World - Ken Dignan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The goal of this book is to help you understand and make the most out of your times of hurt and pain. God uses suffering as a powerful tool to develop character, compassion, humility, faith, perseverance, and even prepare you for how you may serve God in heaven. It is my prayer that you will be encouraged, enlightened, and educated, so you can make sense out of why God allows suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready to discover the vast scriptural details in the lives of the biblical characters, the truths God revealed to them in the Bible that deal with suffering and what they were inspired to say about their trials and tribulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with that youll see the way suffering has influenced my perspective and how my faith in God and His Word has prepared me to live a blessed and productive life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Dignan is an ordained minister involved in vocational ministry since 1976. He and his wife, Joni, have 4 sons: Andrew (wife Jodi), Patrick (wife Jennifer), the late Ryan, and Britt Stephen, and two granddaughters. He is a polio survivor, author, and founder of Til Healing Comes Ministries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
