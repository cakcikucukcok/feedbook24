  <title>Your Last Chance to Get It Right! (A Journey from Darkness into Light) - Alan W. Hayden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since antiquity, mankind has been searching for God in all the wrong places, which has resulted in a world that is tormented, driven by evil, and out of control. In traveling the globe, the author has witnessed firsthand the misery, squalor, and hopelessness of people who are struggling to find true meaning in their lives. Billions of people are living in darkness and ignorance because they have never known the peace and tranquility of a personal, loving relationship with the Lord, Jesus Christ. The author understands that trying to explain love to someone who has never been in love is not easy. But, with a fervent desire, the author attempts to show nonbelievers the way with the confidence that the Holy Spirit will do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
