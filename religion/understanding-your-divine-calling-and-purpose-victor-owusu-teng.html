  <title>Understanding Your Divine Calling And Purpose - Victor Owusu-Teng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The most important discovery you can make in life is to understand the purpose you were born for. Every product is designed to accomplish a purpose. I am yet to see a manufacturer creates a product without a purpose. God created us and determined our individual purpose He wants us to accomplish in our lifetime. This creative ability is divinely extended to man. Example, Steve Jobs created and determined the purpose of Apple products. The Wright brothers created and determined the purpose of the aircraft, today we can fly across the globe. The names continue on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen, the fact that you were born and remain alive today is because you have a unique purpose designed for you to accomplish by your manufacturer (God). Finding that purpose will give you maximum satisfaction and significance in life. No body, regardless of the circumstances that characterized his/her birth is an accident. God allowed you to be born because He has a grand plan and purpose for your life. He knew you were coming even before your conception. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Before I made you in your mother&amp;#39;s womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I chose you for a special work. I chose you to be a prophet to the nations.&amp;quot; (Jer 1:5). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I have written this book to help you understand that there is a unique purpose for your life that has to be fulfilled, as you yield to God. Be bless as you read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
