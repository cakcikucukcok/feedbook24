  <title>American River Road Beyond 2017 - John Worker for Jesus Christ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 1960s saw the dawn of manned space fl ights, and America quickly recognized its destiny to seek out things beyond earth. Despite the nations external wars and internal confl icts, the sky and the future possessed our imaginations. People had so much hope, so much looking forward. We were living American Pie years before the song with that title would come out.
Today my soul longs for the innocence of that childhood view. In those days of long ago, friends and I preferred to be outside, throwing a ball, searching for new fi nds, walking through fi elds and forests, looking up. We never kept in touch. Where are they now? Do they feel as alone as I do? My chest aches like an old hollow log, its emptiness fi lled with pangs of joyful memories of things once whole: a family, a neighborhood, a nation. A lost time it is, a lost spirit am I, and inside me lives a heart that weeps for a dying country. The mortal situation is so clear.
Together let us travel a 50-year American river road of loves sharp curves, deaths hazardous potholes, and murders sudden downhill drops. We will dive into the polluted river of the decayed American soul, descend to its very bottom, and crawl in the muck. We will then swim up and out of the river, onto its opposite shore, to begin our walk through swamps and forests that lead to a steep uphill climb to an incredible place of panoramic view. The driverJohn Workerasks that the reader not become overly shaken as he steers you through a dark valley of personal refl ection, that you courageously survive it, get through it, because, well, you will fi nd out when you get to the top of the other side:
