  <title>The Beating of My Hearts - Brian L. Fowler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Taking his heartbeats for granted, Brian L. Fowler, MD, never thought he would lose any of his own. But on October 14, 2009, he discovers his beats are being stolen one by one. The culprit? A rare inflammatory disease called cardiac sarcoidosis, which results in deep, penetrating scars that trigger unpredictable life-threatening arrhythmias.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Fowler, an emergency medicine specialist, understands the deadly potential of each arrhythmia. His fear of death reveals an additional and more insidious heart disease, which is undetectable by PET scan or EKG, for its affected heart rests deeply hidden where anguish and delight coexist. Like his physical heart, his spiritual heart is weary, scarred, and beats chaotically. The two diseased hearts need diagnosis, treatment, and healing. Frustrated, scared, and armed with a physicians knowledge, a patients suffering, and a believers doubt, he begins a fascinating journey to discover the real reason for &lt;i&gt;The Beating of My Hearts&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With transparency, vulnerability, and honesty, Brian allows us to look in on his profound disorientation, hear his questions, follow his search for meaning, and ultimately discover a fresh orientation to the life that was in him all along. I found myself walking closely and attentively with him on his journey. This was well worth the read.&lt;/br&gt;
