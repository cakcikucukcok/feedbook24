  <title>Family Crucible: The Influence of Family Dynamics in the Life and Ministry of John Wesley - Anthony J. Headley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book explores the life and ministry of John Wesley from the perspective of Murray Bowen&#39;s Extended Family Systems Theory and to a lesser extent from Alfred Adler&#39;s concept of family constellation. Throughout the book, the author uses concepts drawn from these theories to explore significant historical and pivotal events in the life of John Wesley. Beginning with family events prior to his birth, the author also explores his early family constellation, influential themes, factors shaping his ministry, and various relational issues, including his relationships with Sophy Hopkey, Grace Murray, and his marriage to Mary Vazeille. It concludes by drawing lessons from Wesley&#39;s life pertinent to today&#39;s ministers." />
