  <title>Healing in Jesus’ Name - Charles C. Koo Md Facp Mdiv</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are many theologies today, but they are irrelevant to daily life and can do nothing about human suffering. These are powerless and empty theologies confined to the brain. Spoken words without power are useless because they do not follow what they preach. Spoken words hand in hand with supporting signs and wonders through obedience are powerful and relevant to daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one model for believers. Jesus is the model. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Jesus is sufficient for us. Only Jesus can fulfill our lives. Jesus is God. His way is Gods way. I do believe that during three years of public ministry, Jesus, the Son of God and our Messiah, showed us everything about what to do and how to do it as we live as believers. All the answers for our lives are in obeying his commands and pleasing him by putting his teachings and demonstrations into practice. Gods word always comes to us in command form: either do it or dont do it. The Bible is a story book of disobedience and obedience. The ultimate obedience is crystallized on the cross of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
