  <title>Deception Today&#39;s Church - Simon Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you know for sure where you will spend eternity? Is your church leading you to heaven or hell? Why are twenty million Americans without work, and who is at fault?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Simon Peters is an ordinary man, a teacher and leader in his professional life. Even so, he has been moved by God to become a Jonah for the twenty-first century through Deception Todays Church: Gods Church or Satans Army? God does not want us to be deceived, and so Peters has been asked by God to address the deception we all deal with in our daily lives, from both the government and, most importantly, from the church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deception Todays Church: Gods Church or Satans Army? Explores the detrimental relationship between the church and the secular world. Peters uses his extensive personal experience in his churches to illustrate many of his points; he also backs his statements up with examples of Scripture. He has been disillusioned by church leaders who respond to issues within the churches they lead with selfish deceptionfollowing their personal needs over Gods needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also talks about the miracles, loss, heartache, and the changing power of God that are part of his life in Gods care. God has a mission for each of us, should&lt;br /&gt;
