  <title>Medicine Bow...A New Beginning - Sally Campbell Repass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MEDICINE BOW... A NEW BEGINNING
The beautiful, Dr. Miranda Sterling, moved to Medicine Bow, Wyoming, one year after the death of her husband, Mardi Carson. She was to become the town Veterinarian.
Mardi had been the love of her life and she thought she would never be able to love again. She didnt know what God had in store for her.
Each year the town had a WESTERN DAY at the local community center. Her friend, Karen Heath, introduced her to some of the local people whom she hadnt met. First, there was Morgan, a Harley Davidson rider, who was irresistible with his boyish grin.
Ethan, the Sheriff of Carbon County, with his charming ways made a big impression on Miranda.
Last, there was Eli, the rancher, who had ridden in on a horse, just as if he was from the old west days. When Karen introduced them, he looked at her with cold eyes of steel. Who had hurt this man so badly to turn him into the cold man he was?
Three men...each one so different from the other. Would they ever cross Mirandas path again?" />
