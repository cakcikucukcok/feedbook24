  <title>Reconciling the Heart and Mind - Don Broad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a devout believer who loves the traditional expressions of faith in hymns, prayers, and creeds, yet also as one with a wholesome respect for modern science, I have often found my heart and my mind to be in conflict. These essays grow out of my struggle to reconcile my heart and mind. The primary clue lies in my opinion that the traditional language of faith is expressed in the language of antiquity, the language of idealism, the belief that the idea itself is the true relity. Today we think in terms of realism, the belief that what we experience through our senses is the true reality. These essays are my attempt to transslaste faith&#39;s lanmguage of idealism into our contemporary language of realism. There is the further complication found in the emphasis on the idea that Christ died to save ME, which minimizes the ethical imperatives of the cross, a particularly grave failing for a nation which now tries to rule the world as Rome did in the first century." />
