&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Cup of Bitterness Cup of Joy
spans about 65 years in the lives of two young girls who were sexually abused
as young children. &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is a
pastor&#39;s daughter who was molested on the one occasion that she was left with
someone other than a family member. Mara is the child of a woman who sells
herself to men and has no apparent concern for the welfare of her child. Mara
is physically and sexually abused by this woman&#39;s husband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt;Mara
is befriended by a teenager who comes briefly into the home to escape the juvenile
justice system of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt;New
  York City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt;. He
takes her to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt;New
  York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt; to get her
away from, &#39;Old Rat.&#39; Throughout her life there are people besides George who
love Mara and seek to help her, but she is unable to wholly receive this love
because she has so much pain and anger as a result of men raping and generally
using her. In her fear and hatred of men and unwillingness to turn her life
over to the Lord, she becomes a homosexual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;span
  style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;span
style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt; also fears men and does not deal well with
relationships, but because she has a loving supportive family and looks daily
to the Lord for guidance her life flows mainly in tranquil paths. However, she
does not have a real relationship with a man (not sex but give and take and
trust) until she meets Bart Franklin, a pastoral student, who challenges her to
be honest, to put the Lord first, and not to run away from situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt;This
the story of two girls whose lives are briefly intertwined in childhood and
then years later are interwoven by God&#39;s grace and wonder once more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt&#39;&gt;Their
bitterness has turned to joy. . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
