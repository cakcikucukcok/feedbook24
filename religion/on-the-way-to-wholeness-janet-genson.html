  <title>On the Way to Wholeness - Janet Genson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;My book is about the ACTSS prayer format. For years I believed that God existed, that Jesus lived and died. That was all it was, a belief. When I went through a divorce after 24 years of marriage I reached the lowest point of my life. I had lived my life in extreme emotional pain and never could fi nd peace. At that lowest point I met Jesus fully. It is there I began a journey of healing. The ACTSS prayer format was a huge part of my healing process.
I finally began a true walk with our Lord Jesus. My book is a book that introduces a genuine faith walk and what it looks like. We need to accept Jesus as our Savior, confess our sins and in that process we begin our journey. We begin to hear the steps we need to take. For me this prayer format helped me put my prayers in a proper perspective and I am learning to pray for what is on Gods heart and my heart begins to align with Gods.&quot;" />
