  <title>What Happens When I Die?: A Promise of the Afterlife - Brian C Stiller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life, as we know it, will end. It&#39;s not a thought that tends to occupy our minds when we are young and in full health and vigor. We take risks, some foolhardy. We live as though we were immortal. And then when we have our own children we are renewed and life is good. But we can&#39;t look in the mirror every day without noticing subtle signs of change. We can&#39;t lose a loved one without reflecting on the passage of time and being nagged by the question, &quot;What is it in life that I have yet to accomplish?&quot; Then it&#39;s not a giant leap from asking that question about ourselves to wanting to know &quot;What happens when I die?&quot;  Brian Stiller, author of When Life Hurts took on the task of answering this challenging question. Where is the proof that anything is going to happen after death? Why not just live life for the day, because that may be all there is? What Happens When I Die? is a journey toward understanding the nature of life after death, one that leads ultimately to the Scriptures and the promise given by God. It is a promise rooted in faith and joy. It is a promise that has everything to do with what we make of our life here on earth. What Happens When I Die? is not just about death, but about living a fulfilled, loving and caring life. The choice is ultimately ours to seek and God&#39;s gift-or not. But the way had been prepared as this insightful and thought-provoking book affirms" />
