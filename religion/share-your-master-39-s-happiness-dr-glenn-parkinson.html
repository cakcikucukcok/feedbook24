  <title>Share Your Master&#39;s Happiness - Dr. Glenn Parkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is recruiting leaders for His future kingdom. Eternal life will involve an ever-maturing dominion of creativity, and those who will lead the way then, are those who love to work with Him today.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Christian, live for that day when the accounts are settled and your future usefulness for all eternity is determined. That day when you stand before God by grace alone, and present to Him what you&#39;ve done with His investment in you.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Study stewardship through a number of biblical texts that deal with improving our mind and body, raising the next generation, loving our neighbors, caring for the environment, and building the church. Learn to use the disposable tools of time, money and spiritual gifts. Along the way, find out what the Bible really says about tithing.&lt;/p&gt;
Far from relegating stewardship simply to meeting church budgets, see it as the way to hear what every believer longs to hear one day from the lips of our Savior, &quot;Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master&#39;s happiness!&quot;&lt;/BR&gt;
-Matthew 25:21&lt;/P&gt;" />
