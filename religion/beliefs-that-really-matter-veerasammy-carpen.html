  <title>Beliefs That Really Matter - Veerasammy Carpen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beliefs That Really Matter is both exegetical and theological in nature and gives clarity to contemporary readers of subject matter that they may find themselves struggling with, in living the Christian life. Just to name a few topics, that the author has discussed in Beliefs That Really Matter are (a) God - Breathed Scripture, (b) Gods Plan of Grace, (c) A New Beginning, and (d) The Faith of One Man.  Beliefs That Really Matter makes people think about why they believe certain doctrines and to examine the doctrines whether if it is biblically sound. The Christian life is unique which we cannot deny, but the real challenge for us is to live the Christian life according to Gods standards and not ours. These concerns should be relevant and timely to the practicing Christian that this book represents. Each chapter of Beliefs That Really Matter is thought provoking and engages the readers not to settle for cheap messages of the gospel that our culture is so quickly to accept that lead many astray from the Bible. For example, cheap messages of the gospel do not develop the believer into a spiritual mature person, but only leaves the believer to sink in their Christian experience and causes confusion for many and disappointment for others. No wonder many Christians face numerous spiritual challenges and find themselves drifting from the sacred writings. Beliefs That Really Matter points the professing Christian to study the Scriptures and to scoop out the meaning for themselves from Gods Word that they begin to apply in their lives as having to form a firm foundation.  
Quite often, we may read a book that does nothing for our spiritual growth and does not challenge certain teachings or examine the Scripture. In Beliefs That Really Matter the author exposes shallow Christian beliefs that resemble a grab bag, and calls attention to the unique Word of God that shapes our lives for a firm foundation. Beliefs That Really Matter is written for college students, pastors and lay leaders and for those who desire to grow in their spirituality and to experience a hunger for Gods presence in their lives. For example, the reader would benefit tremendously from the book by doing a Bible study on their own, share in a small group discussion, to be used as a text for a Sunday school class or to be used as a college text book in the discipline of Christian theology, especially in the area of apply soteriology. The contents of the book are clear and specific that does not leave the reader in the dark, but rather motivate the reader to strengthen his faith and to connect with the sacred writings that feeds his soul.  Beliefs That Really Matter is a wealth of information to the readers that enjoy responsible exegesis and theological explanation of words and there meanings, grammatical tenses, expressions, misunderstandings and contradictions. Each chapter is concluded with a short study guide that enables the readers to think about their need for spiritual growth and enrichment and to dig into Gods Word as hidden treasure.
