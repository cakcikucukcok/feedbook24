  <title>Camryn’S Fire: a Mother’S Grief Revisited - Catina White Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book tells a true story of a young woman trying to get through a tragic event that rocked the very foundation of her family. Her youngest son was involved in an explosion that almost took his life. Her journey is one of sadness and dismay that is accompanied by the sting of past events. This mother recounts sexual abuse and heartbreak in this compelling story. God was surely dealing with not only that brave young man that was tragically injured, but also with his doting mother who had to learn to cope with the fact that her life, from that point on, was really just beginning. This story also gives courage as we see how a little boy overcomes the horrible treatment rituals that would bruise his soul in every way had it not been for God stepping in to save his life. The goal in this story is to tug the hearts of every reader but to also give hope to readers who have encountered and are overcoming tragic obstacles. This gives hope and faith that God is in charge of every situation and can fix anything that comes our way. He is showing us every day that there is no limit to what God can do. We are also showed that God is a very present help in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
