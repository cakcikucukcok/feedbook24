  <title>Run - Rebecca Gumina, Heather Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winning the spiritual Race does not depend upon how fast you Run; it is determined by how you Run. There is a right way and wrong way to Run. Having an organized Training plan is your only chance to make it to the Finish Line. This book study will become a personal Training manual. Run will give you instructions and resources that will equip you to win the Race. The Christian life is often described as a Race  one designed by God. In it, we are called to fulfill His purposes for us. We need to be in spiritual shape. Trying to run a marathon is very different from Training to run a marathon. Lets get fit  we cant quit when the going gets rough. We can go through all the religious stunts, but unless there is a desire to Train to be like Jesus, few make it and many fall to defeat. A great factor in success is consistency. We may start out in front, leading, but if we do not stay consistent, we become entangled in the affairs of this life.
God has called you to Run the Race set before you! Fall on your knees through this study and embrace your Race! Its possible to Run the entire Race, and even cross the Finish Line, only to realize you have been disqualified because you did not Run in such a way. Life is not a game with no lasting consequences. The way we Run has eternal consequences.
Lace up, friend; you have a Race to win!" />
