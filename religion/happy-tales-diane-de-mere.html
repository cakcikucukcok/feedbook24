  <title>Happy Tales - Diane de Mere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;After moving to Seattle in 2004, I was searching for ways to manage stress and find peace and joy. This story is set against a background of changing careers and relationships with elderly parents, with wonderful animal stories along the way. It is a story about living in nature in the Pacific Northwest with bald eagles (Abby and Abe), loons, otters, deer, and orcas. You&#39;ll read about the antics of our two rescued malamutes, King and Sabre, and our trip to Seattle from Los Angles via RV with our rescued dog, Annie, and rescued cats.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book is a compilation of thoughts, daydreams, poems, and notes in a journal spanning ten years. The immense beauty that surrounded me became the force that helped me transition from being a successful but stressed-out corporate trainer to the person I wanted to be: someone who was able to handle the stress of frustrations, demands, disappointments, and personalities. It is an open monologue of what I did and how I did it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For you, my journal is meant as an example of how to find peace, laughter, and beauty in your day. It is a shining patha lighted journey we can choose to follow that lifts us upward and onward with hope, faith, love, and peace.&lt;/P&gt;" />
