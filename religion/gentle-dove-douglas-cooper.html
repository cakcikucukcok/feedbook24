  <title>Gentle Dove - Douglas Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book may be hazardous to your religious lethargy!&lt;br/&gt;
No one reads this book without being changed! &lt;br/&gt;
No one reads this book without being incredibly challenged and blessed! &lt;br/&gt;
Why? because the topic of the Holy Spirit carries with it a powerful transforming energy which renews the soul of anyone who approaches it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the cross, the most important teaching in all of Christendom is the doctrine of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. John said that he baptized with water, but the one who was to come after him would baptize with fire and the Holy Spirit! This sacred fire, the fire of love, is here. Now. A gift. A treasure for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to demonstrate that the filling of the Spirit is not merely an idea to believe in but an enlightening, empowering encounter to be experienced each day. It is the throbbing heart of a vital, dynamic Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is rising as Christians move the foundation of their spiritual lives from law to grace, from rules to relationship, from dogma to devotion from belief to experience. This book invites you to be part of this exciting journey, part of the new Pentecost. It is designed to move you from a traditional doctrinal paradigm as the foundation of your religious experience to a new, relational-spiritual paradigm which recognizes that connection in the now, moment by moment intimate connection with the Divine through the in-dwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us. Romans 5:5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
