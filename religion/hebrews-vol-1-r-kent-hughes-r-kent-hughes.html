  <title>Hebrews (Vol. 1) - R. Kent Hughes, R. Kent Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book of Hebrews conveys a double dose of spiritual power. It not only presents the greatness of Christ in ways no other New Testament writing does, but it repeatedly demands a heart response from the reader. No one can study Hebrews and not grow spiritually and come face to face in a new way with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also true that no New Testament book has had more background research than Hebrews, and none has spawned a greater diversity of opinion. However, virtually all agree that the grand theme of this epistle is the supremacy and finality of the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life-changing themes come from God to us in this marvelous epistle. The unequalled glories of Jesus Christ&amp;mdash;the solemn danger of drifting away from dependence on divine grace&amp;mdash;a heavenly high priest who understands and is ever ready to help&amp;mdash;the rest only God can give, even in the middle of trials and of demanding ministry&amp;mdash;the hope that is ours through a blood covenant with an awesome God&amp;mdash;these and other topics from Hebrews must be understood and put to work practically if we are to live and serve as God&#39;s people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who preach, teach, and study the Word of God will find this book a gold mine of helpful discussion a Bible book easily misunderstood and often overlooked. With divisions and outlines that are never forced but flow naturally from the text, Hebrews will be a great resource for all who desire to communicate God&#39;s truth and seek to grow in their own faith through personal Bible study.&amp;nbsp;Part of the Preaching the Word series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
