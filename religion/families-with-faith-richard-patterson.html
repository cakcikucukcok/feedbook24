  <title>Families with faith - Richard Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Families are under threat. How can Christian parents create strong, loving family experiences that nurture faith in Jesus?
The daily pressure of tiny tots throwing tantrums ... teacher resignations escalating because of classroom disruption and exclusions ... police and courtroom time overwhelmed by juvenile crime ... depressing divorce statistics. Newspaper headlines confirm that family life is under threat as never before.
What can Christian parents do to survive the pressures? More than that, how can they create the kind of strong, loving, faith-nurturing family experiences that give their kids a real introduction to Jesus? 
Christian parents, counsellors and church leaders will welcome Families with Faith as a readable, warm and affirming guide that is strong on common sense and inspirational in its aim to put God at the very centre of family life. This book is unique in combining parenting wisdom with an emphasis on passing on the Christian faith to the next generation. It is a must-read for all Christian parents. 
Scripture Union has also launched a free downloadable parenting course based upon this book, called &#39;Survival skills for Christian parents&#39;. This interactive, discussion-based course can be run weekly, monthly or once a term! It is easy to use and flexible enough to suit any group. It could even be used with parents in a school setting who want to explore the values they pass onto their children.
