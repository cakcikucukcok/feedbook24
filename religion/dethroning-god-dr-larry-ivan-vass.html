  <title>Dethroning God - Dr. Larry Ivan Vass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Postmodernism has spawned a dichotomy of relativistic views on whether God is sovereign or not and whether if He even exists at all. If everything is relative, how can God be sovereign, and how can Jesus Christ be the only way to God? What is right for you may not be right for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dethroning God is a book that defines postmodernity. It discusses the moral consequences of the ideas of philosophers from John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche to Jacques Derrida and Stanley Fish; how parallelism influences intertextuality in the Bible; the cultural manifestations of late capitalism, postmodernism, and anthropology; how contextualization competes with globalization; and the postmodern and postliberal challenges to modern liberal Christian theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it defines and explores the sovereignty of God, his sovereign will as Creator of all things, how postmodernity denies the sovereign will of God, how his sovereign will infringes on liberty, and what attitudes we should have toward the Creator of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor Vass rejected being a member of the Christian family for years. Being made alive has fostered a desire for Jesus Christ so fervently that Doctor Vass feels as though he has no option but to counter the culture that has for a hundred years tried to marginalize God and his redemptive work through his Son. There is a noticeable lack of theology today of proper doctrine and understanding of just who God is. Not only did He create all that there is, He owns and controls all that there is. Teaching and preaching abound on peripheral matters, but professing Christians are woefully deficient in understanding the nature and character of God and how secular beliefs impact what understanding Christians have. Doctor Vass earned his PhD in theology researching and writing on the reformed view of God in the postmodern world. The time has come to share this information with the world, especially the Christian world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
