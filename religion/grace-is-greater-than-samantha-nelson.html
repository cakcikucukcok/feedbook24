  <title>Grace Is Greater Than - Samantha Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are many things that have happened in my life that I know other people are able to relate to, understand, and empathize with. Some of my favorite points of my journey are when I have seen no way out and God has shown up in ways I didnt think were possible, restoring relationships and feelings I thought had come to an endespecially my marriage. There is not one single highlight to my life or this book but many, because on many occasions God will show up and intervene for you. What better highlight is there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words in this book are my hopes and fears, my dreams and responses, the things I turned to when I had nothing else to do, and the raw and painful experiences accompanied with beautiful, beautiful victory. It describes my journey from lost to found and from broken to whole, but most importantly from blinded to being able to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my testimony, the story that God has brought me through just so that it can inspire you to dream bigger, to love more, to never give up, but most importantly to inspire you to get to know God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
