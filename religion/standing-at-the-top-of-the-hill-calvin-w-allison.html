  <title>Standing at the Top of the Hill - Calvin W. Allison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Searching throughout the seasonal change, observing during clear blue skies, and dark, thundering storms, theyre looking within you, listening for a tone of heart unlike the one sounding out from their own. You are at the top of the hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we have been given the task of taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. This task is not an easy one. We encounter great difficulties carrying out this duty. The Bible says that we are the light of the world; a city set on a hill cannot be hid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are here, placed in a position of influence. There is no retreat into a secluded world of me, myself, and I. We are the light of the world. Jesus has called us to Himself, and having done so, placed a calling upon our lives. It is His light that we carry, His light that others see, His love that others feel, through us. Christ in us, the hope of glory. We have been bought with a price, and we are not our own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing at the Top of the Hill is the newest book by author Calvin W. Allison. There are two purposes for this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) To call the world to open up their eyes to the life-changing gospel of Jesus Christ.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) To encourage other believers to progress in the great calling that is on their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we never take for granted the great task that lies before us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
