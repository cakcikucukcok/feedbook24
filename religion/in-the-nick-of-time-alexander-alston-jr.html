  <title>In the Nick of Time - Alexander Alston Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The writing of the book was formed in my mind as a young man, stimulated by time and circumstances the book grew powerful within me.   Why did I think it was timely to bring these opinions of mine to the print was that for years the Lord has lead me As I travelled to different places more truths were revealed and exposed as lies.  I didnt write all I do know because of the threats I have received just preaching about them.  Potentially, I gain to achieve more thought and to look at God and Jesus through my eyes and the bible.  If this book causes you anger or pain, then you are not in the group of people I am describing as sheep.  Not everyone is going to understand or agree with my findings, but remember Noah was preaching about a world being destroyed and no one paid attention to the flood swept them away.  It only takes one of Gods servants to announce His approach, not ministers with their assumptions, not a world leader who takes control; He uses only His own choice not humans.                                                      AMEN" />
