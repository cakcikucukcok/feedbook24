  <title>A Layman&#39;s Christianity - Ken Dickason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sordid romance! &lt;br&gt; 
Gripping intrigue!&lt;br&gt;  
Fast-paced action! &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these really describe a book about theology, and they, surprisingly enough, do not apply to &quot;A Layman&#39;s Christianity,&quot; either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are looking for a well thought out book, replete with scriptural references, written, not by a dreary doctorate of theology nor by a &quot;hip,&quot; &quot;young&quot; pastor of a mega-lo-church, but by an average joe, then look no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written from a young man&#39;s perspective, &quot;A Layman&#39;s Christianity&quot; is a book that delves into the belief that every man has the right to think about who God is and what He wants from our lives and that phrase, &quot;every man,&quot; is not restricted to age, gender, or educational background, but rather should be based on the author&#39;s commitment to God and his love for His Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Layman&#39;s Christianity&quot; is not a &quot;how-to-manual&quot; for living a better Christian life, but is rather an outline of several characteristics and ideas that, taken together, form the author&#39;s ideal Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving room open for argument and individual thought, &quot;A Layman&#39;s Christianity&quot; refuses to be taken at face value and insists that the reader check its assertions with the Bible, thus fulfilling the purpose of the book: that every man and woman who follows after God has the right and responsibility to think about Him and upon Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
