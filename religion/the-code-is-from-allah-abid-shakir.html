  <title>The Code Is from Allah - Abid Shakir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This publication is an attempt to explain how man discovered the CODE of Almighty Allah in natural order, early in his development; and how he was able to see its value as TREASURE for human growth.
Man begin to search for ways to preserve the code, one way was by planting seeds, key to cultural insight. It is not hard to believe that the CODE of Allah exist in natural order, it takes FAITH to see the code of Allah in DAY to DAY occurrences.
This publication is a TESTIMONY of my QUEST to EVOLVE, UNDERSTAND and EXPLAIN the INSIGHT of CULTURAL and HUMAN development.
The REPARTITION in this publication is for UNDERSTANDING; if you understand this you understand SECRET INSIGHT of world rulers.
The SLAVE GIRL is CARRYING .
This publication is based on understanding and my quest to grow as a PERSON, as a MUSLIM, and into UNIVERSAL understanding under the teachings of Imam W.D. Mohammed. Over a THIRTY THREE year period I came to understand the insight of universal knowledge and its value to human development, and how our culture and early scripture is based on this knowledge both in secret and open. As a student of the Imam, I have published FIVE books with the hope of helping others to better understand the value of this knowledge, and to better understand the insight of revealed knowledge as it relates to world culture. This publication is a REVIEW and EXTENTION of this quest." />
