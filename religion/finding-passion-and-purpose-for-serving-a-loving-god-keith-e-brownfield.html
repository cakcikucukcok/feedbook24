  <title>Finding PASSION And PURPOSE For Serving a Loving God - Keith E. Brownfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many of our churches, and the individuals that comprise them, seem to have lost &quot;their first love&quot; for Jesus Christ and choose to be disobedient to God&#39;s commands to serve Him in ministry and evangelize unbelievers.  We seem to have forgotten our purpose. If we Christians are going to change the world, we need to renew the passion and purpose that we once had for Jesus Christ and begin sharing Him with unbelievers while serving each other in ministry. You are invited to join me on this spiritual journey in search of your own passion and purpose in serving Jesus Christ.  Along the way you will be able to re-ignite your passion for ministry as you discover God&#39;s holy purpose for your life. You can follow four simple steps of the Spiritual Life Cycle that begins with salvation and culminates with a lifestyle of ministry and evangelism.  The roadway has rest stops that allow you to discover God&#39;s holy purpose for your life as well as uncomplicated guidelines for your personal renewal and restoration. In Acts 1:8, Jesus uttered these last words just before His ascension, &quot;You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.&quot;  With the power of God within us, nothing can stop us from succeeding.  What is holding you back?  Your answer will lead you to Finding Your Passion and Purpose for Serving a Loving God." />
