  <title>A Spider Trap - Fred L. Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pope John Paul II - Tear down your wall of sins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;As a victim of sexual abuse by an alcoholic, pedophile priest at the age of 11, I endorse this book and this message.&quot; - Gerald Payne (June 11,2004)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Spiders Trap the sequel to Dont Holler at Me, I Didnt Write the Bible, gives a vivid crisis of the problems that are embed throughout the Christian Bible that dove-tail precisely with the problems that are embed in the clergy within the Roman Catholic Church, as well as all denominations of religion established that are of the Christian faith.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont Holler at Me, I Didnt Write the Bible first deals with the Bible.  It was easy, and to be expected, mistakes were made, as they were hand copied and passed from one generation to the next.  In many cases, the holder of a bird quill entered his or her own ideas into the manuscript.  Under the best possible temperature control, and the best quality print materials, paper, ink, etc like one might find in the Library of Congress manuscripts would hold its quality, at best, for just a few hundred years.  For that reason history has only a few hundred years old manuscripts in existence today.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern discovery of allegedly ancient manuscripts has caused some publicity-seeking individuals to endorse these recently discovered manuscripts as authentic.  They are nothing more than forgeries, fakes that common sense dictates that no other decision needs to be considered.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of my sequel to Dont Holler at Me, I Didnt Write the Bible deals with the sexual abuse of children and young adults by the clergy of the Roman Catholic faith, starting in January of 1992 to December, 2003.  As we speak, factual recorded history of child sex abuse by the Roman Catholic clergy and priests  bishops, archbishops, cardinals  as reported in the news print names, dates, places, the cover-ups, suicides, number of priests, bishops, cardinals, their names, location, action taken and by whom, fines paid (totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, some settled, others pending), the selling of church property of the diocese and/or archdiocese, prison for some, names, dates, places, and places where abuse occurred (some were actually performed on the altar).&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me want to puke, just one big rotten smell.  Now you can see why I dovetailed together the abuse of the Christian Bible in cadence with the abuse of young innocent Christian children.  Let there be no mistake about it:  your Bible and my Bible is in deep trouble, your church and my church of the Christian faith is in deep trouble.&lt;p/&gt;" />
