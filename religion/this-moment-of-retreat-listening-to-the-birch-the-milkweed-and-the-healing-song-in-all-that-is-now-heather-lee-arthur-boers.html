  <title>This Moment of Retreat: Listening to the Birch, the Milkweed, and the Healing Song in All That Is Now - Heather Lee, Arthur Boers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Moment of Retreat is a companion guide to spiritual growth and healing. Over the course of seven chapters, readers are encouraged to retreat into the present moment to listen to the healing guidance that is being sung in the voices of Scripture, prayer and meditation, journaling, poetry, and song. Each chapter features a theme of healing and offers an opportunity for personal or group retreat through prose, poetry, prayer, or reflection activities that help the reader claim beauty in the midst of the darkness that so often accompanies--and fuels--the growth of the soul. Readers will find soul-touching inspiration in the lyrics and links to original songs by author Heather Lee included in each chapter. While listening and singing along with these songs, the teaching and healing work of their retreat moments will be deepened through music and voice. In a society that is so often governed by fear, worry, and shame, this book discovers and embraces the beauty of the imperfect self, the process of healing, and the way-finding to life by encouraging spiritual depth, presence, listening, and ongoing conversation with God." />
