  <title>Endtime Messages for the Bride of Christ - Deva Evu Lawrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Christian world is awaiting the Second Coming of Christ to take the Bride of Chist with him in glory, which we call Rapture. There are many explanations from various quarters. The First Coming of Christ is past. The Third Coming will take place when Christ, the son of David comes down on the Mount of Olives to rule the earth for a millennium. The Second Coming is on.
The author Bro. Deva Evu Lawrie had had an experience of peace with God early in life at the age of eight. He had been a keen observer in the ministry of his father. He was a student of the famous Madras Christian College, Tambaram, Chennai. He became a full-time minister of religion when he was eighteen. He had been working with his dad since then. 
There was a great turning point when his dad, Bro. Paulaseer Lawrie, was preaching at Chicago, USA. He had a great experience of God coming down into him when man first landed on the moon on July 20, 1969. The sky opened, and he could see and feel a great and terrific power enter into his life (Luke 3: 2122).
In these pages, Bro. Deva Evu Lawrie, the author, shows that most of the prophecies and things concerning the Second Coming have been fulfilled in the ministry of Bro. Paulaseer Lawrie of India. He cites mostly from the Holy Scriptures. He wants the readers to go through the book carefully so that they do not miss the glory that God had foreordained for us in this generation.
