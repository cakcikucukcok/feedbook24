  <title>Working with the Twelve - Stanley Njoroge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book reflects my 40 years of experience in public life. Though it is hard to write everything down, I have resolved to write a few.&lt;p&gt;
While I mention the word politics it is because as a young man I was engaged in campaigning for Candidates, who were to form the government after Kenya attained independence in 1963; there were so many promises made to us the youth, that after Kenya secure independence, we who were involved would be employed. This never happened. The question remains, who should be elected to serve the people with integrity and truth?&lt;p&gt; 
In education circle, I do have some experience that administration and teaching, is also an area, in which judgment of characters, becomes a great concern.  A teacher might have a different approach and decision making. I did encounter this kind of situation while I was a teacher at Grace Baptist Bible College for seven years, in Nairobi, and also as TOT [Trainer of Trainers] Personnel for three years, at Limuru, Kenya. Therefore, the administrator needs wisdom to keep the team working without bragging.&lt;p&gt; 
In business, I was once the owner and Director of Kiamuri Poultry and Eggs Supplier.  At times, when the business was in a full swing in making profit, one of my most trusted employee decided to quit, he abandoned the store without my knowledge. To me it was a bitter pill. What I mean is that my own cabinet members those whom I put all my trust on them turn to work against me.&lt;p&gt;
Finally, I am very much involved in church ministry and I have observed that hypocrisy is a serious, destructive weapon, that which demolishes the foundation of faith. The critical problem is how someone could choose the right person, who could be honest and trustworthy to be a member of an inner circle.  In every group of individuals there are some professionals not professors of faith in truth. This kind of people, are very hard to be noticed because they live in a pretense lifestyle, it requires divine intervention. The twelve represents and discharges some qualities that send the light as to how the leadership is all about." />
