  <title>Should Women Preach? - Rev. Salvatore Mancini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some church organizations do not believe that women can preach, pastor a church, or lead in church ministry. What does the Bible say? The Lord really showed this to me, because these same questions came into our church office. As I began to look into Gods Word, I got really excited about it. Its something that needs to be confirmed to all churches today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message deals with the call of women to preach the gospel and work in leadership within the church. So perk up, ladies, and listen, men, because we have to understand spiritually, where we all fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important to know and to allow that grace of God to move in every one of our lives. This issue in the church world needs to be addressed once and for all. Should women have the right to preach or teach in the church?&lt;/p&gt;" />
