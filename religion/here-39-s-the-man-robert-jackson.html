  <title>Here&#39;s the Man - Robert Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You cannot know Robert Jackson very long before you are aware of his passion for Jesus. It is this passion for Jesus that provides the desire that he has for mentoring men to become all they can be for Jesus. Robert&#39;s prior books asked the question, Where is the man? He begins to open up Joseph&#39;s life to declare in this book, HERE&#39;S THE MAN!
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants to be viewed as a failure.  You were created to dream and given gifts to make that dream happen.  As God declares His will for our lives we begin to make a plan to achieve or reach for that will.  However, unplanned disruptions seem to build roadblocks to that destiny or the fulfillment of our dream. Are they roadblocks? Are these disruptions keeping us from God&#39;s will? We begin to question have we really heard from God?  Did we miss something in what I thought was God&#39;s plan for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book about Joseph, you will find principles that can help you to understand how God, the Father moves from declaring His will to taking us unto the plan of fulfilling that will.  The important insights and illumination in this book from God&#39;s Word can alter our mindset, keep us from fighting the plan God has for us, and alter the circumstances of your life and bring a change that will positively impact you and your family.  You will be challenged and changed as you see how God finally declares to Egypt and the world HERE&#39;S THE MAN!&lt;/p&gt;" />
