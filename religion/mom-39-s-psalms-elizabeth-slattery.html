  <title>Mom&#39;s Psalms - Elizabeth Slattery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you know that being a mom is a vocation, a gift from God? I bet that didnt occur to you as you were knee deep in laundry or driving your tenth carpool of the week! But did you also know that God is in our everyday life? In fact he cares about us and he is there to provide support. Have you ever wondered just how to put your frustrations or joys into words? Have you tried to turn to God for help but not known how? In these pages you will discover how easy it is to turn to the Lord in times of happiness or distress. This book is a collection of short poem prayers reflecting on many aspects of a mothers life. Each one, after presenting a challenge or a joy, points to God in prayer, either in thanksgiving or supplication, thus creating a Psalm-Moms Psalms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
