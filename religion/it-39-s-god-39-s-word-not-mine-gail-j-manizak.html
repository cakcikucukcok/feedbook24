  <title>It&#39;s God&#39;s Word, Not Mine... - Gail J. Manizak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gail Manizak is a gifted prophet. At sixteen years old, Gail became a born-again believer; joy filled her heart daily as page after page of poetry was written. Being full of Gods presence, she wrote daily as He led. At twenty-four years old, Gail, having been baptized in the Holy Spirit, received a gift of writing prophetic words. As with the poetry, it came very naturally to write what she heard in her ear. It was prophesied in 1971 that she would hold the office of a prophet. In April of 2010, she was officially released by leadership into the office of a prophet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prophetic words spoken confirmed this portion of her call, the first being spoken over her life forty years ago. This gift has been used to minister to people all over the world. In 2009, the Lord dealt with her about opening up the websites for personal prophecy requests. She was reminded of all the psychics, soothsayers, palm readers, card readers, and astrologers that were operating in the gift but not of the Holy Spirit. People were accepting a spirit of deception and lies. To be a servant to the people is an honor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
