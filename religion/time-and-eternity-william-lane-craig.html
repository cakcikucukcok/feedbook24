  <title>Time and Eternity - William Lane Craig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time and Eternity&lt;/em&gt; deals with difficult issues in modern physics and brings them into relation with traditional theological doctrines. Craig has done a great work, and it is marvelous that now the philosophy of religion is engaging with the philosophy of science to the great benefit of both.&lt;br /&gt;--John R. Lucas&lt;br /&gt;Fellow of Merton College, Oxford University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time and Eternity&lt;/em&gt; offers a comprehensive discussion of the problems in the concepts of time and eternity on the basis of an extraordinary familiarity with a vast number of recent contributions to this issue from scientists and philosophers. The argument is subtle and precise. Particularly important are the sections on the impact of the different versions of relativity theory on the concept of time.... The book offers a plausible argument for a realistic conception of temporal process and for God&#39;s involvement in the temporal distinctions and processes because of His presence in His creation.&lt;br /&gt;--Wolfhart Pannenberg&lt;br /&gt;Professor of Systematic Theology&lt;br /&gt;Ludwig Maximilliens Universitaet-Muenchen, Germany&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a scientist doing theoretical research in gravitational physics and quantum cosmology, I found Dr. Craig&#39;s thoughtful book highly interesting. He has carefully given arguments defending several different viewpoints for each of the many issues about time that he discusses, followed by critiques in which he emphasizes his own opinion. Reading &lt;em&gt;Time and Eternity&lt;/em&gt; has forced me to develop better arguments for my own opinions (which differ considerably from Craig&#39;s).... I am certain that &lt;em&gt;Time and Eternity&lt;/em&gt; will also stimulate your thinking about this fascinating subject and your appreciation for the God who created time as part of the marvelous universe He has given us.&lt;br /&gt;--Don N. Page&lt;br /&gt;Professor of Physics and Fellow of the Cosmology and Gravitation Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research&lt;br /&gt;University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;William Lane Craig is one the leading philosophers of religion and one of the leading philosophers of time. In this book, he combines his expertise in these areas to produce an original, erudite, and accessible theory of time and God that will be of great interest to both the general public and scholars. It is a rewarding experience to read through this brilliant and well-researched book by one of the most learned and creative thinkers of our era.&lt;br /&gt;--Quentin Smith&lt;br /&gt;Professor of Philosophy, Western Michigan University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Time and Eternity,&lt;/em&gt; William Lane Craig defends the remarkable conclusion that &amp;quot;God is timeless without creation and temporal since creation.&amp;quot; Craig argues his case philosophically by carefully weighing evidence for and against divine temporality and personhood in light of dynamic versus static theories of time and their warrants, in turn, in a Lorentzian interpretation of special relativity and an objective, mind-independent theory of becoming, including fascinating excursions into Big Bang cosmology and the philosophy of mathematics. As the latest in his series of ground-breaking books, &lt;em&gt;Time and Eternity&lt;/em&gt; summarizes and extends Craig&#39;s previous technical arguments and conveys them to a more general audience. It is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in the problem of time and eternity in Christian philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;--Robert Russell&lt;br /&gt;Professor of Theology and Science&lt;br /&gt;Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, Calif.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nature of time is a continuing source of puzzlement both to science and in everyday life. It is also an important issue in theological understandings of the nature of God. In this interesting book, Professor Craig tackles this complex set of topics in a clear way. His discussion of the interrelated scientific, philosophical, and theological issues clears up many previous misconceptions and proposes a plausible understanding of the relation of God to time and eternity that many will find helpful.&lt;br /&gt;--George Ellis&lt;br /&gt;Professor of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics&lt;br /&gt;University of Capetown&lt;/p&gt;" />
