  <title>Singing the Faith - Georg Retzlaff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sunday gospel readings are normally &quot;enforced&quot; by hymns selected by the organist, according to suggestions made by a choirmaster&#39;s handbook. Often the choice is rather limited, both in number and intellectual or theological content. Preaching the gospel can be seriously undermined by a gospel hymn which reflects thinking not exactly suited to the 21st century or, for that matter, the first century. Too much dogmatic baggage is packed into hymns which pretend to explain and express the official version. Preachers who wish to look at different angles find themselves at odds with some hymns, finding it even necessary to contradict their slant from the pulpit. This book attempts to put Jesus and His gospel into song, providing an alternative, more modern, more traditional, more to the core of the actual message of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
