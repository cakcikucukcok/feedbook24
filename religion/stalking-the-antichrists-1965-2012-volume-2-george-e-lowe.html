  <title>Stalking the Antichrists (1965–2012) Volume 2 - George E. Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Volume 1 of Stalking the Antichrists and Their False Nuclear Prophets, Nuclear
Gladiators, and Spirit Warriors,1940-1965 is essentially an enhanced memoir.
It is based for the most part on my personal observations and knowledge and
specialized information from my academic studies of history, political science,
and literature at Grove City College and the University of Chicago,as well as my
professional insights into the heart of the U. S. Navy (1953-1957, 1960-1961[OP-
09D]) as an Air Intelligence Officer in Hawaii and Japan and the Pentagon; political-
military/counsellor assignments in the State Department as a Foreign Service
Officer(FSO-6) at the American embassy in Paris (1962-64); and a speechwriter in
the Navy Department (1965).
&lt;P&gt;In volume 2, the textual narrative begins with the end of my specific actions/
activities in the Navy and Foreign Service in July 1965, which I have called How
I Lived in History, 1950-1965. In retrospect my entire Navy careerfrom my commissioning as Ensign USNR, 1355 AIO, in early September 1953 at Naval
Station, Newport, Rhode Island, to my first honorable discharge at Treasure
Island on August 27, 1957was in preparation to an understanding of World
War II and the Cold War." />
