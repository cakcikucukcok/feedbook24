  <title>Chasing Contentment - Erik Raymond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The biblical practice of contentment can seem like a lost art&amp;mdash;something reserved for spiritual giants but out of reach for the rest of us today. In our discontented age&amp;mdash;characterized by impatience, overspending, grumbling, and unhappiness&amp;mdash;it&#39;s hard to imagine what true contentment actually looks (and feels) like. But even the apostle Paul said that he &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt; to be content in whatever circumstance. Paul&#39;s remarkable contentment, in any and every situation, was something that was grown and developed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Chasing Contentment&lt;/em&gt;, Erik Raymond helps us understand what biblical contentment is&amp;mdash;the inward gracious spirit that joyfully rests in God&#39;s providence&amp;mdash;and then how we learn it. Giving us practical guidance for growing in contentment in various areas in our lives, this book will encourage us to see contentment as a priority for all believers. By God&#39;s grace, it is actually possible to pursue the high calling of contentment and anchor our joy in God himself, rather than our changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
