  <title>How to Read the Bible - Harvey Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Renowned religion expert and Harvard Divinity School professor Harvey Cox deepens our experience of the Bible, revealing the three primary ways we read it, why each is important, and how we can integrate these approaches for a richer understanding and appreciation of key texts throughout the Old and New Testaments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible is the heart of devotional practice, a source of guidance and inspiration rich with insightful life lessons. On the other side of the spectrum, academics have studied the Bible using scientific analysis to examine its historical significance and meaning. The gap between these readings has resulted in a schism with far-reaching implications: Without historical context, ordinary people are left to interpret the Bible literally, while academic readings overlook the deeply personal connections established in church pews, choir benches, and backyard study groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;How To Read the Bible&lt;/em&gt;, Cox explores three different lenses commonly used to bring the Bible into focus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Literary&amp;#8212;as narrative stories of family conflict, stirring heroism, and moral dilemmas;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  History&amp;#8212;as classic texts with academic and theological applications;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Activism&amp;#8212;as a source of dialogue and engagement to be shared and applied to our lives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing these together, Cox shows the Bible in all its rich diversity and meaning and offers us a contemporary activist version that wrestles with issues of feminism, war, homosexuality, and race. The result is a living resource that is perpetually evolving as our understanding changes and deepens from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
