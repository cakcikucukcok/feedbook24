  <title>A Devotional for the Depressed and the Insane - Stephan Hess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My thoughts were, when I discovered that I had ADD, &quot;Well my life is mostly over and now I find out that I have ADD.  What could I have accomplished had I known about it when I was younger and could have possibly made the right adjustments to succeed where instead I merely stumbled?&quot;  A question...
Yet that question, like any other question, is something you don&#39;t sit on.  Because if you do, you really don&#39;t want the answer, you want to wallow in self-pity.  But if one pursues it, even when some aspects of it appear to be (at least in our lifetime) unanswerable, one pursues their life.  
Answers will come.  And sometimes they will come in unexpected ways that words can&#39;t quite express. Yet our hearts can feel those answers...and they can take you to places that you never thought you could ever go to. 
If your heart is touched and if you keep on following forward, you&#39;ll indeed find yourself in places that you would have never thought of.  But please don&#39;t stop!
That&#39;s the purpose of this book, &quot;A DEVOTIONAL FOR THE DEPRESSED AND THE INSANE&quot;.   We get stuck. 
I believe that a great deal of humanity , me included, just give up.  We settle.  
But...what if we&#39;re not meant to settle, to give up?  Then maybe we were meant to live, to really live!...to our dying breath (and maybe even beyond that...)?  Who knows?
If we&#39;re not supposed to surrender ourselves to the well-that&#39;s-just-the-way-it-is  mentality then, for sure, we stand a chance of finding ourselves depressed and, maybe, a little insane if we do surrender. This book is for whoever picks it up.  This book is for whoever is struggling.
Each day a moment to read and then answer a question or two; just for yourself.  Write them down in the NOTES/THOUGHTS part if you want to.  It will become your book.  If you pursue those questions and those answers, it will become a chronicle of your journey, your adventure...  No longer a devotional.  But your story.
...The devotional will become a story...about you." />
