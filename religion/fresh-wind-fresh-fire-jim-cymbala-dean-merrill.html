  <title>Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire - Jim Cymbala, Dean Merrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE THAN ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For anyone seeking to live at the center of God&#39;s purposes, this well-loved book points the way to new spiritual vitality in the church and in your own life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classic must-read for readers looking for hope and transformation in the church today,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows what the Holy Spirit can do when believers get serious about prayer and the gospel. As this compelling book reveals, God moves in life-changing ways - calling us back from spiritual dead ends, apathy, and lukewarm religion - when we set aside our own agendas, take him at his word, and listen for his voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastor Jim Cymbala knows from personal experience. Back in the early 1970s his own church, the Brooklyn Tabernacle, was a struggling congregation of twenty. Then they began to pray, God began to move, and street-hardened lives by the hundreds were changed with the love of Christ. Today, they are nearly ten thousand strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this twentieth&amp;nbsp;anniversary edition, Cymbala updates the classic stories, including that of his own daughter, Chrissy Cymbala Toledo. He talks about how the church has grown and how God helped the church move from its location on Flatbush Avenue to a larger facility that the growing church couldn&#39;t &quot;afford&quot; as God continues to dramatically reshape the life stories of so many people who encounter Christ and the power of the gospel. This message of hope and transformation continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also available in Spanish,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Fuego vivo, viento fresco&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
