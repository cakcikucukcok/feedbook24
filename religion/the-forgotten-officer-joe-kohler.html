  <title>The Forgotten Officer - Joe Kohler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Bible teaches that the church is the fullness of Christ on earth (Eph. 1:23) and that God is able to do abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within the church (Eph. 3:20). So why are so many people disappointed with their church experiences? Why do so many outsiders view the church as irrelevant? Why do so many hop from one church to the next looking for fulfillment? Why are so many professing Christians seeking a form of Christian experience that no longer needs any connection with the organized church?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that we have collectively drifted away from Gods blueprint for growing the body of Christ up into full maturity and attaining the fullness that he designed. We have inherited a leadership model that is more influenced by pagan practices, pragmatism, and capitalism than by the Scriptures. This cultural inheritance is extremely powerful, and it has resulted in a contemporary blind spot on a biblical truth of critical importance. It has led to our modern failure to properly recognize and appreciate a gift given by Jesus to his bride! This is the bad news.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that reform is possible.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn what has been forgotten, and rediscover the fullness of Gods design for his church!&lt;/p&gt;" />
