  <title>My Purpose Is Greater Than My Fears! - Marrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Purpose Is Greater Than My Fears! Is about my past experience and current experience with God.
Having been born and raised in Church, Ive learned firsthand that not everyone who purports to be Christians conduct themselves in a manner that could be seen as being Christ-like.
I turned my back on the church as a teenager due to the relentless attack on my mothers reputation. This was orchestrated not by a stranger, but by my mothers own cousin, a pastors wife. As a result of this, I temporarily lost my faith and turned from the denomination of faith that I was raised in. I was convinced Id never return to church, especially after I gave birth to my beautiful baby girl.
I felt the need to protect her from the assassination I had to endure, and the only way I knew how to do this was to avoid church at all costs.
I began to run. Little did I know that my running would come to a halt. Little did I know that the very institution I was running from would be the institution where Id learn that my purpose is to help, save, and restore those who are broken. This purpose became so much greater than my fear of being surrounded by those who spread venom out of jealousy.
Ive found my purposea purpose that has been bestowed on me by God." />
