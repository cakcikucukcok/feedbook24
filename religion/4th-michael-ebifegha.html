  <title>4Th - Michael Ebifegha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;4th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Refuting the Myth of Evolutionism and Exposing the Folly of Clergy Letters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Darwinian theory of evolution begins with facts (science of microevolution) and ends with fiction (myths of macroevolution). The myths are part of our experience, no transitional organisms in the living world, and part of our discoveries, no transitional fossils in such deposits at the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang sites, where various kinds of organisms appear together in large collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his fourth book, Refuting the Myth of Evolutionism and Exposing the Folly of Clergy Letters, author, Michael Ebifegha, stresses that real science is timeless and based on events that are directly or indirectly observable, testable, and repeatable. Challenging evolutionists and their clerical allies who are banning the teaching of creationism in public schools, Ebifegha insists that evolutionism is also outside sciences purview and, therefore, should be banned as well. He reprimands clerics for capitalizing on human knowledge but failing to recognize the validity of Gods personal claim in speech before an audience and in print on stone tablets for having created the world. These interventions, he asserts, fulfills the worlds standard legal requirement for inventors. 
Ebifegha argues that the inconsistency of imposing evolutionism as scientific truth on the public and banning creationism violates (1) the academic rights of accomplished scientists who disagree with evolutionism on scientific grounds; (2) the US Supreme Courts 1992 declaration, At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life; and (3) Gods historical claim to ownership of the universe. Instead of separation of church and state, Ebifegha recommends separation of worldviews and state." />
