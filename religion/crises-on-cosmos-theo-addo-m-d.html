  <title>Crises on Cosmos - Theo Addo M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Crises on Cosmos, Dr. Theo Addo emphasizes a common theme: most people who are discounted by society as no good are simply individuals or populations who have not been exposed to valuable knowledge, or have failed by their own doing to keep focused and capitalize on their opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book examines the value of knowledge and asserts that knowledge is so priceless that without it life itself is unsustainable. It further describes how certain longstanding societal practices deemed as norms tend to disenfranchise huge sectors of populations based on race and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Addo brings a different perspective to our many crises and affirms that the repercussions of our wrong decisions, teachings, and policies, and sometimes our denial of obvious inferences and truths hardly ever favor us. Those repercussions often live on to fight another day in completely different and more militant forms. Yet if we are able to muster hope we can overcome adversity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
