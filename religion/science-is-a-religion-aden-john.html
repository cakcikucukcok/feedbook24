      <meta name="description" content="What Is The Big Bang REALITY, and how does it affect The Big Bang Theory? Is there no other approach to The Unifi ed Field Theory? Perhaps Scientists should be content harmonizing The Four Fundamental Forces controlling all matter rather than attempting to unify them.
Graviton is not just a hypothetical carrier force of Gravity; it actually exists. Indeed, it may have a zero charge, but it has a Net Zero Restless-Mass and not a rest mass of zero. Is there nothing new that man can learn about The Bermuda Triangle, which science may not have told us?
The Sun has an eleven-year activity cycle, and in AD 2018, it should again be in its lull of magnetic activities; what if Tritium, the radioactive isotope of Hydrogen (whose Half-Life is just about twelve years) is much present in The Sun and long already halving? If so, that means in AD 2018, The Sun will become darkened, and so life on Earth will no longer be supported. The Sun will then balloon off into Mercury, and our electronic communication systems will instantly crash, and the whole Universe will experience an irreparable cataclysmic chaosmeaning the end of all Existence and a Closed Universe. Then, The Open Eternal Universe may begin.
Truly, the limitation of Science is The Dwelling, Residence, and Habitation of God. Within the boundaries of the failures of Science, there God residestherein has He decided to disprove the seemingly infallible human Laws of Sciencecontinually invalidating the claims of The Scientiststhe followers of Science. Within that same realm of the failures of we humans, therein also has God chosen to Re-Validate His Own Believable Claims as regarding His Conscious and Evidential Existence.
If we look much deeper into The Big Bang Theory, we will realize that Truly our Scientists are not wrongonly that there are some obvious misallocations of Divine Nomenclatures, which have grossly been swapped for human terminologies. In Truths, we must understanding that The Big Bang Theory is not just only the postulation of The Galactic Existence, but it is indeed an approach as to trying to explain The Mysteries of The Holy Trinity.
And there is more . . . so much more!
