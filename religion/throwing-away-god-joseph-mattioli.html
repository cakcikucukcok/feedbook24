  <title>Throwing Away God - Joseph Mattioli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Throwing Away God&lt;/b&gt; is a God-inspired unconventional five-chapter book that uses the writings of the bible to alert the reader to five false premises taught within today&#39;s denominational church system. It exposes them as theological dogma and frees the spiritual essence of the Bible&#39;s teachings. Premises are unmasked that impede the very path to the goal Christians claim to be seeking.  And that goal is to be one with the Father himself, even as Jesus was one. It uncovers by the writings of the King James Version of the Bible in a systematic way these premises and their dangers and seeks to prove the way of faith and hearing from God for oneself is and has always been God&#39;s perfect plan.
&lt;P&gt;
The book exposes these falsehoods and exhorts the reader to question things he has been taught by humans and instead seek God&#39;s revelation directly. It exhorts the reader not to be a conformist but rather to uncover the simplicity of God&#39;s church and knowing Him. It brings one back to the very foundation of the New Testament Church. The foundation that is hearing directly from the Father himself by seeking our hope in knowing God through Christ in us, our hope of God&#39;s presence. It points to Christ, the anointing of the Spirit of God as the true teacher of all truth rather than a man or a book. It is a book for the world of religion for the 21st century!
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Throwing Away God&lt;/b&gt; addresses and benefits three groups of people.  Firstly, it will benefit new Christians who have been born again. The book points out the dangers of placing one&#39;s faith back in doctrines of men. They will be exhorted to continue with their first love rather than allow themselves to be put under the bondage of organized denominations and their man-made ordinances and doctrines. Secondly, it will benefit the long-term Christian who has been bombarded with premises accepted by men through ignorance. Christians that have made themselves subject to men who have left their first love. Men who neither enter into the kingdom of God themselves nor suffer others that are entering to go in. Christians who have been caught up in the organized denominational system and got on the path of doctrines and ordinances and works through their own understanding and trust in men. Long-term Christians who know there is something more but have forgotten what the true church and a personal relationship with God is all about. Thirdly, it will benefit those who have never had a personal relationship with God because of their exposure to the church system and its unacceptable dogma and hypocrisy. For them it will be enlightening and create hope and provoke faith to touch God for themselves." />
