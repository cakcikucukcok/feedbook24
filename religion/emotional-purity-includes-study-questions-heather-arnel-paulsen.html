  <title>Emotional Purity (Includes Study Questions) - Heather Arnel Paulsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever given your heart to someone who didn&#39;t love you back?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you feel like you&#39;ve experienced heartache over and over again?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are emotionally attached to someone, it&#39;s easy to cross the line and become emotionally intimate. Then if the relationship doesn&#39;t work out, you&#39;re left with scars on your heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The church teaches us the importance of physical purity; but it teaches little about emotional purity. Christian singles often wear their hearts on their sleeves, which can lead to intense, emotionally intimate, male-female &quot;friendships&quot; with no commitment to pursuing marriage. People may have had several of these &quot;friendships&quot; and still consider themselves pure, but in reality they have given away pieces of their hearts that should be reserved for their future spouses. &lt;cite&gt;Emotional Purity&lt;/cite&gt; will show you how to define and set boundaries in your relationships to avoid making the same mistakes. Learn how to guard your heart and keep it emotionally pure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using fictional and real-life examples along with sound biblical advice, author Heather Arnel Paulsen outlines the pitfalls of undefined relationships and presents guidelines for living an emotionally pure life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
