  <title>I Did It &quot;His Way&quot; - Elizabeth Das</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sister Elizabeth Das is originally from Ahmadabad, India. She moved to the United States as a young lady searching for truth. Since the day she found the one true living God named Jesus, she has shared this precious Gospel Message in Acts 2:38, with people all over the world. The Lord has really gifted her with an ability to understand His Word. This anointed talent helps her to teach Jesus, from any scripture in the Bible. She is very perceptive of each persons level of understanding. Her teaching and life examples are proof of how God is pouring out His blessing and giving the increase through continuous prayer and fasting. 
God has worked many healing and delivering miracles through Sister Elizabeth, which continue to witness to many people here and abroad. She truly serves God with a totally submissive and willing heart. God is doing amazing things as a result of her dedication to prayer. You will feel the anointing of her burden and her passion for the Lord as you read this book. Just open your heart and let it bless your soul. To God Be the Glory!
