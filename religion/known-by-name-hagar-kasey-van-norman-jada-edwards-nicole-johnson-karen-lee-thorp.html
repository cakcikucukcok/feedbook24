      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The women in the Bible asked the same three questions we all still ask today:&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;How does everyone else see me? How do I see myself? How does God see me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagar&amp;rsquo;s story, found in Genesis 16, is a story of cultural victimization. She was betrayed, abandoned, and scorned. Her response? She did what most of us would do when deeply hurt by someone we trust&amp;ndash;she ran away. She got defensive. She retreated to a place where she felt safe. She felt justified in her anger and hurt. But deep in her core was a woman who longed to be seen and hoped for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Bible study will take you through Hagar&amp;rsquo;s story as she learns from hurt and heartache that what is unresolved is not unseen by God. The lack of finality in Hagar&amp;rsquo;s story teaches us to trust God with the ending&amp;ndash;believing he sees us and he knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study guide features video notes, group discussion questions, and between-session activities like reflecting on the drama and teachings, studying the character story in Scripture, memory verses, and journaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exposing the Lie of Shame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rejected to Accepted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trusting after Betrayal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transformed and Seen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for use with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Known By Name: Hagar Video Study&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(9780310096498), sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;" />
