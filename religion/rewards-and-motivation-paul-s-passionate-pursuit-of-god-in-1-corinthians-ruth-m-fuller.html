  <title>Rewards and Motivation: Paul’s Passionate Pursuit of God In 1 Corinthians - Ruth M. Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Historically, theologians and church leaders have had difficulty with the Bible’s use of rewards to motivate godly living. This has troubled them because it seems that God’s response when people meet the conditions for receiving these rewards would encourage self-centered pride. Paul clearly presents rewards as incentives; so investigating his writings will be profitable, because, while promoting rewards, he also insists upon selflessness, humility, and the obedience of faith as proper ways to engage with God’s grace. For Paul the primary reward the gospel offers is fellowship with God, experienced as displays of grace. In “Rewards and Motivation” Ruth Fuller shows that to desire these is to desire what God himself delights to give; thus self-interest both pleases him and is essential to loving others selflessly. These rewards represent how much someone delights in God. They are tokens which testify to the inestimable value of God and represent his glory rather than the recipient’s." />

Fuller</i></b> | The word "passion" is never related to our ministry to people. Paul uses "passion" only to describe his desire to know Christ (Philippians 3:10). The words "compassion," "burden," "concern" always describes our ministry to people. Compassion means "with passion" or love with fire that is the result of our passion for God.<br /><b><i>Our Passion and Pursuit - globalchristiancenter.com</i></b> | Motives for the Pursuit of Excellence The Glory of God. 1 Corinthians 10:31 So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. In thinking about biblical motives for the pursuit of excellence we are brought face-to-face with the issue of the chief purpose for the Christian life.<br /><b><i>Mark #11: The Pursuit of Excellence | Bible.org</i></b> | Since I’m focusing my lectionary reflections this cycle on the second reading (epistles), we are invited to consider the message for Pentecost that comes from 1 Corinthians 12.

In fact, it is the place we go to understand how the Spirit works in our lives.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Rewards and Motivation: Paul’s Passionate Pursuit of God In 1 Corinthians - Ruth M.
