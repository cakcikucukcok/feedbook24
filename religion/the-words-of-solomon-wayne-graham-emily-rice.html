  <title>The Words of Solomon - Wayne Graham, Emily Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Words of Solomon is an in depth study of the first nine chapters of Solomons Proverbs, as recorded by the Old King James Bible. These are the chapters which provide a continuous narrative that is told from the perspective of a Hebrew father instructing his son to pursue Wisdom through obedience to Gods law. The remaining chapters of Proverbs go on to address a wider array of random godly principals and their practical application to human life on earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to better understand these ancient teachings, the father/son relationship between Solomon and David is first examined, and found to be lacking. Like many fathers of today, King David was a very complex and busy man, but he was also the only man described by God as a man after my own heart. The Proverbs show us that Solomon had devoured his fathers own writings, the psalms, and incorporated them into an easier understood text, which was then chronologically arranged as a manual for a functional father/son relationship.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It should be no surprise that Israels wisest king wrote a literary masterpiece capable of being interpreted on multiple levels of understanding. Solomons hidden nuggets of precious wisdom, written three thousand years ago, are brought to the surface to transcend the boundaries of time, for a twenty-first century application. Reading this book will convince all of Wisdoms students that mining Solomons gold is a very worthy pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
