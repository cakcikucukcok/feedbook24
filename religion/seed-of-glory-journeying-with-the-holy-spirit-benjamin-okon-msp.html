  <title>Seed of Glory Journeying with the Holy Spirit - Benjamin Okon Msp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What has come to assume the form of seed of glory is an extract from my experience of God in the Holy Spirit. Its a journey that began as a search for meaning and fulfillment in life. I had studied the sacred scriptures for various reasons in the past: to write exams, to give a talk, or just for curiosity to know and acquire knowledge. But this time, I wanted to encounter God on the pages of the sacred writings. Since the Word of God is spirit and life, I desired to encounter the power of the spirit through the written words of God. This was my starting point for my journey with the Holy Spirit. I had very strange experiences that words cannot express. At a point I was commissioned to commit my experiences to writing. That was how I came about the Seed of Glory: Journeying with the Holy Spirit. 
The work is written in twenty-two chapters. The first chapter deals with Rhema: The Power of the Spoken Word of God; the second chapter presents the Anointing of the Holy Spirit; the third chapter, Teaching with Authority; the fourth chapter, Church Election; the fifth chapter, Forget Ye the Things of the Past (Isa. 43, 1819); the sixth chapter, Mary, the Ideal Mother (Luke 1, 26- 38); the seventh chapter, Jesus in Agony; the eighth chapter, The Paschal Mystery; the ninth chapter, The Power of Authentic Worship of God (John 4, 24); the tenth chapter, The Voice and the Voices; eleventh chapter, A Curse and a Blessing; twelfth chapter, Put on the Whole Armour of God; thirteenth chapter, The Track Route of the Holy Spirit; fourteenth chapter, The Power of Spiritual Connection; fifteenth chapter, Baptism of the Holy Spirit; sixteenth chapter, Gifts of the Holy Spirit; seventeenth chapter, Angels, Archangels, and Guardian Angels; eighteenth chapter, The Gift of Speaking in Tongues and Its Interpretation; nineteenth chapter, 666: The Number of the Beast!; twentieth chapter, Exposing the Jonah in the Boat (Eph. 1020); twenty-first chapter, The Temptation; twenty second chapter, Recovering Our Exalted Position (Joel 2, 2527). 
It is my hope that my little shared experience of God in this write-up might help shade some light on certain aspects of our human day-to-day experiences in our relationship with God and with one another." />
