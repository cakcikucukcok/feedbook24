&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;OUR MISSION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Over the past century , the world has been witnessing a gradual decline in the state of global peace.At a recent conference of World Religious Leaders in Assissi, on the invitation of Pope Benedict XVI. These Leaders expressed the concern that the declining state of world peace is partly fueled by growing religious crises like terrorism across the globe. Accordingly, it was resolved that global religious leaders should strive to contribute to the recovery in global peace . Pope Benedict followed up the resolution with his establishment of the Pontifi cal Council on the New Evangeliztion --PCNE to stem the growing De-christianization in most advanced countries and enhance the effectiveness of the weapon of Evangelization as a means of contributing to Global Peace and Religious Freedom. The Pope called on all the Lay Members of The Catholic Church to rise up and contribute to the mission of the PCNE. Our Mission is a humble response to the Popes call. In Book 1, the Author surveyed the teaching and history of the Church through a military perspective. He concluded that WE ARE AT WAR WITH SATAN, the only enemy of God and Man. That war started from the Garden of Eden after mans creation. It has been going on ever since. Author therefore reminds the world that its wars and crises, from the family to the global levels are rooted in this war against Satan, fi ghting us, as it did to Adam and Eve to commit sins by disobeying Gods Commandments. Through our disobedience and sins, we bring, as Adam did, wars and crises from our families to the global levels. Accordingly, the Author concludes that we cannot avoid sins if we do not understand the Teaching of Christ Our Only Leader and recognize the voice, language and strategies of His enemy, Satan in tempting us to sin. The Author views the teaching of Christ as the Pillars that sustain our lives and modern governance against the attacks of the enemy. He therefore warns that driving God out of our private and public lives can only move us faster on the path to wars, crises and declining global peace. He therefore provides in these Books his views on how to avoid sins by recognizing the ways that the enemy, Satan lures us to sin. Through such recognition, we can learn how to avoid its temptations. In the world of today, most sins arise from our denial or lack of knowledge of these sins at all levels of our activities and lives. The principle of the Separation of State and Religion is being misinterpreted to mean denying sins in our political,economic and social lives.In Books 2 and 3, the Author continues his surveys of the enemys strategies to cause wars between Christianity and Secularity and shows how the two can cooperate to fi ght back and reduce our wars and enhance global peace. In Book 4, he shows how the enemy uses us in our various professions to be its agents to cause wars that lead to a decline in peace from our family to the gobal levels. Finally, in Book 5 he surveys the on-going Warfront against our Religious Freedom to obey Gods Commandments in all our Religious and Secular activities.. He concludes with strong Recommendations on building the Knights of The Cross Mission of warriors from our Grass root parish levels of the church to the global leve&lt;/p&gt;" />
