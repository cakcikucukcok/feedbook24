  <title>Preacher and the Bear - B. Stanley Tieszen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is often the case that many who want to spiritually affect their circles of influence simply lack the tools necessary to do so. As a result, many faithful Christians fail to consider this biblical mandate. Through the use of Scripture and illustration, Preacher and the Bear will enable the follower to live more aware of God-appointed opportunities, to see who their real audiences are, and know how they might be more effective among them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preacher and the Bear encourages a respectful investment into the lives of others who curiously and cautiously seek us out. In quiet and sensitive cooperation with the Holy Spirit, relationships are born, and God is pleased to work in that environment. Moreover, as the soil of our own hearts is conditioned, it affects the entire landscape of our experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through engaging narrative and thought-provoking ideas, Preacher and the Bear will empower individuals to reconsider what they think about evangelism and how they might more effectively engage the communities God places them in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
