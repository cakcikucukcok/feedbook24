  <title>They Came to Heal Us - Elmer M. Haygood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book reveals the non-traditional work and characteristics of angels as they labored to save mankind after a great disaster in the ancient world of Pangaea.  Man had once again incurred the wrath of God through disobedience at the Tower of Babel and suffered the consequences of catastrophic geographical changes that rivaled the Great Flood of Noahs time. Mankind then needed healing on a grand scale worldwide which was accomplished through the dispatch of legions of angels from God.  This outpouring of angels to minister to the ills of men brought them from the brink of extinction during a period that is memorialized in stone. These stone memorials are located throughout the world in such places as Stonehenge in England and the Carnac Stones in France. The masses of people created grand monuments to show their gratitude for the immense healing campaign by the angels.  The worldwide  campaign was in later years transitioned  to seasonal visitations as recorded in the Bible in such stories as the healing at the  Pool of Bethesda.
This book will highlight the very unfamiliar and very non-traditional methods of operation by angels as they healed, traveled and communicated to achieve their goal of saving mankind." />
