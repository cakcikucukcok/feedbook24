  <title>Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation Between Church and State - Daniel Dreisbach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No phrase in American letters has had a more profound influence on church-state law, policy, and discourse than Thomas Jefferson&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;wall of separation between church and state,&amp;#8221; and few metaphors have provoked more passionate debate.  Introduced in an 1802 letter to the Danbury, Connecticut Baptist Association, Jefferson&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;wall&amp;#8221; is accepted by many Americans as a concise description of the U.S. Constitution&amp;#8217;s church-state arrangement and conceived as a virtual rule of constitutional law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the enormous influence of the &amp;#8220;wall&amp;#8221; metaphor, almost no scholarship has investigated the text of the Danbury letter, the context in which it was written, or Jefferson&amp;#8217;s understanding of his famous phrase. &lt;B&gt;Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation Between Church and State&lt;/B&gt; offers an in-depth examination of the origins, controversial uses, and competing interpretations of this powerful metaphor in law and public policy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
