  <title>Good Morning Butterfly - John F. Grooves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr. Groves believes that many Christians today are questioning who they truly are, and how they fit into the kingdom of God. They have had doubts about what God says they will become or what they can be, and challenge whether God will keep His word with what He will do in their lives. They are having trouble with their faith and trust in God.
Mr. Groves was also having trouble dealing with his trust and faith. One day, Mr. Groves felt  Gods presence imparting the message that He would show what was needed to know and to become one with Him.
Mr. Groves experiences and journey compelled him to reveal what he has learned to others through Gods wisdom. It is important to include your heart, mind, body, and soul and to, conditionally, love and trust His word. This book reveals Mr. Groves discovery of the power behind trusting Him everything that he does, and everything He says, even when we are in the midst of our troubles. He explains how having faith in God, and God alone, will bring us through whatever we are enduring.
As Mr. Groves began to reconnect with God and reveal that he had felt left down by God in the past, he learns a very valuable lesson, and is delivered from the old and into the new with God. His journey through trust and faith has led Mr. Groves to tell his story.
John F. Groves writes, I can recall the journey of transformation that God put me through to become one with Him. This was the process of being tucked away inside His cocoon of grace, and trusting His timing, His process and allowing Him to completely remake me through His mercy. It was   time of not knowing what or who I would become once I submitted to His will, and not on my own. But I followed Him, even though I could not see what He saw in me!" />
