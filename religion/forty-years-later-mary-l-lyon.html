  <title>Forty Years Later - Mary L. Lyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When we struggle isnt it nice to know that someone understands? God has given us a cloud of witnesses who understand. Biblical characters struggled with their faith; demanding bosses; unfairness; loss of jobs, family, and friends; and even loss of life, but they also found God faithful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty Years Later: Gods Faithfulness Across Generations looks at the stories of biblical characters and, more importantly, at their wilderness journeys as they struggled and grew in faith. God has a plan for His children. God is committed to building faith in His children. God uses struggles in the wilderness to train His children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli nation refused to enter the Promised Land the first time. Forty years later in the wilderness, they were ready to trust God. Joseph spent years as a slave and prisoner and saved his family from famine. Moses, one of the greatest leaders in history, suggested that God use someone other than himself to lead the nation out of Egypt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God leads, guides, provides, wins the battles, and is ever present with His chosen ones. In the struggles in the wilderness, we learn to know God as our leader, provider, and protector. When everyone else fails us, God remains faithful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God also teaches us, as His chosen, to help others on the journey He has for them. God chose us. God uses us. Forty Years Later will inspire you to see God in your struggles and find hope that He who is faithful has a plan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
