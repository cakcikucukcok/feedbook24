  <title>Does God Wear Pants? - Daniele Gross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God can&#39;t wear pants. Pants are material. God is spiritual. You search everywhere in the Bible  NO pants. Which means pants don&#39;t matter to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All military troops wear pants into battle. You can&#39;t just go into battle without pants! That&#39;s just silly. So why doesnt God need a dashing set of trousers to guard His children or Himself? Because pants are just pants. Thats why pants arent included in the Armor of God found in Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To these statements, I say, Nope. Youll see.
That&#39;s not how we&#39;re thinking here, and that&#39;s not true.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God does care about pants. In this book I will tell you the exact reasons why He cares about pants and how He has provided pants as protection for His Children.&lt;/p&gt;
You need to know where the pants are so you can discover
