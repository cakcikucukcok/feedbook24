He has learned that our greatest opportunities often come from our greatest disappointments. Today, he is doing what he was born to do, and he knows it didn&#39;t happen by accident. Tankard encourages readers to examine seven key elements-Dreams, Environment, Subconscious, Time, Inspiration, Network, and You, sharing his life-tested secrets to help readers find their own way. Including fresh insights on familiar Bible passages, wisdom from Tankard&#39;s own setbacks, and laugh-out-loud stories, Tankard shows readers that they too can have a &quot;full tank&quot; life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
