  <title>Refining Fire - Duane C. Eastman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book for healing wounded churches. When a church experiences conflict, it results in a wounded people. Healing for the church involves a healing of the people involved. The process is essentially the same for both. That is because the church is Gods vessel for healing the deep wounds of the human soul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing process set forth in this book is the application of biblical principles of grace that actually work. They have been tested and found to be amazingly effective. Damaged churches can experience renewal and become effective vessels of grace to their community. Wounded believers can experience renewal and restoration, discovering a dimension of Gods presence either forgotten or never before known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the reasons for conflict and division, rediscovering the healing impact of Jesus mission, catching a new vision of what it means to be the church in todays world, and designing a local fellowship so that healing grace defines worship and ministry is the focus of this book. As such, it is both a manual for personal healing of the deep wounds of the soul and for healing the wounded church.&lt;/p&gt;" />
