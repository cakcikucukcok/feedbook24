  <title>The Seventh Plane - Craig Tanner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;This book is the product of many years of mental effort spent in the creation of philosophy and ideas. In it, you will find many ideas and thoughts devoted to the glorification of the human spirit. The spirit of this book teaches that the inner nature of Man is God; that God is the thought of being, and everyone who manifests the image of God in their body, in some way, manifests the thought of God in their mind; but that God is a thought that is greater than any of the minds that think it. You will also find in this book the life story and mental thought train of someone who has experienced the limits of the human mind; having known a mental illness that has opened up avenues of philosophy and suffering unknown to those that have never had their mind torn to shreds and cast to the dust; knowledge of the unconquerable human spirit found in all those that have touched this life with compassion. &lt;/P&gt;" />
