  <title>Clouds Are the Dust of His Feet! - H. Wayne Sampson PhD ThD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Man&#39;s fascination with clouds is legendary: their appearance, their formation, their beauty. Meteorologists use clouds to help predict weather. There&#39;s even a Cloud Appreciation Society with more than 34,000 members who share pictures and stories of clouds. Clouds also remind us of God&#39;s majesty, power, and beauty in creation. Indeed, the heavens declare the majesty of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Clouds Are the Dust of His Feet! author H. Wayne Sampson shares the role of clouds in Scripture. He examined each of the 157 references in the Bible referring to clouds and then organized them into several similar groupings to determine their function or role in the verse. In the course of this study, Dr. Sampson discovered that clouds in Scripture reveal an array of characteristics of the almighty God, such as His might, creative power, mercy, and gracious provision, as well as the promise of security by our heavenly Father. Dr. Sampson also demonstrates God&#39;s imagination in using clouds as transporters, His kindness in establishing a way for the frightened Israelites to speak to him, and His guidance and protective power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clouds are the Dust of His Feet! communicates that clouds, as well as all the other wonders of nature, should remind us of the loving creator.&lt;/p&gt;" />
