  <title>Tithing to Grow in Christ - Samuel Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your Tithing to Grow in Christ is more than a book. It is your devotional guide designed to practically assist you in spiritually relating to God personally in your tithing. As you use this devotional guide, you will soon find yourself experiencing seven things. These seven things are as follows: 
?	Getting you closer to God
?	Thinking about God
?	Praying to God
?	Reading about God
?	Honoring God
?	Giving to God
?	Hearing from God
Next to the Bible, the Tithing to Grow in Christ is what you and every local church member must have. It is the devotional guide book that you need in order to tithe by the principle of knowing and relating to God personally. That was the principle of tithing God established with Abraham when he was made to tithe to Melchizedek in Genesis chapter 14. 
Your spiritual growth in Christ in the areas of trusting, loving, and being holy to God is guaranteed with your use of the Tithing to Grow in Christ. It situates you into building a strong personal relationship with God and to nurture the integrity of the personal presence of God in your life. The integrity of the personal presence of God is what you need to be certain about the personal influence of God in your life. 
Having the certainty concerning the personal influence of God in your life puts you above, calms your anxieties, reduces your stress, and gives you the peace and boldness to face any challenging situation, as it was the case with David in going out to fight with Goliath.
