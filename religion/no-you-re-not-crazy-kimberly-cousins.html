  <title>No, You’Re Not Crazy! - Kimberly Cousins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We can all feel a little crazy sometimes, but when your anger drives you mad, you risk trekking a deep downward spiral that ends only in defeat. You can, however, be caught before you hit rock bottom. If you have ever felt as if life was simply driving you crazy or passing you by, you are not alone. But there is good news!  You do not have to go through life feeling that way. You do not have to allow the trials of life to write your ending or steer the direction in which you sail.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;Break the many habits that you are unknowingly acting out due to erroneous thinking that hinders your understanding, growth, and potential.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Explore the hard-core truths of how to get out of your own way and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out who you really are by beginning to live according to your own path instead of the one that others have designed for you. 
Dare to distance yourself from doubt and believe that you are capable of actually achieving that dream that you&#39;ve placed on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the day that you no longer allow crazy thoughts, madness, or anger to distract you from living your own life. We only get one chance to live here on Earth. We might as well enjoy the experience, and what better time to start than right now!&lt;/p&gt;" />
