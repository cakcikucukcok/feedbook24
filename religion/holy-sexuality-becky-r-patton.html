  <title>Holy Sexuality - Becky R. Patton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What in the world does sexuality have to do with spirituality? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us treat these two topics like oil and water. Couple that with the fact that sexuality tends to be a taboo subject, and were left with incredible misinformation about this intimate and powerful aspect of our lives and our identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book addresses a Top 5 list of questions that many of us carry: &lt;br /&gt;
1. What does sexuality have to do with spirituality? &lt;br /&gt;
2. Are men and women really that different and why &lt;br /&gt;
does it matter? &lt;br /&gt;
3. What does healthy sexuality look like for singles? &lt;br /&gt;
4. If everyones doing it, why save sex for marriage? &lt;br /&gt;
5. Is masturbation a sin? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youve struggled with any or all of these real-life questions, this book is for you. Fresh truth from scripture and amazing new revelations in brain science and biology are converging to provide a wealth of insight and a holy invitation: Can we recognize our sexuality as good by Gods design? And can we embrace real-life questions as sacred invitations to learn more about the amazing love of God for men and women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Sexuality has shifted my view of men/womens relationships &lt;br /&gt;
and taught me to truly value and embrace gender differences.&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Kapsner-Bible &amp; Theology Bethel University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creates a beautiful picture of Gods design of sex. &lt;br /&gt;
