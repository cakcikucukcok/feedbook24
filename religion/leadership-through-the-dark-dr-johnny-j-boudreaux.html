      <meta name="description" content="This book will explain the procedures in which leaders should use to develop their ministry while offering instructions on how this is done. The process will be different for each individual;  this is presented in the chapters of this book. Each chapter has its own issues expressed by way of suggestions in how to focus on them. It presents the mode and characteristics of leaders and what appears to be their motives and concerns. The book displays leaders in many different ways, good and bad. It reveals that darkness is not always a see-less disposition, but, a self made category that place excuses and self made reasons for failure. You will love the descriptions given along with the circumstances incurred in these chapters, and may feel at some point in the book it is speaking about youthat is when you will realize how energizing it will be to the ones who reads this book!" />
