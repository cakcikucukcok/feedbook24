  <title>A Moment in Time - Mark Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Moment in Time&lt;/em&gt; will encourage believers to entertain principles of grace-based theology and, after careful consideration, embrace them. When were convinced of the gracious simplicity in acquiring the free gift of eternal life, it impacts how we share our faith. When were confident this free gift cant be lost, it calms us down. When were certain Christ will repay and recompense us for what we do with this free gift, were motivated to be holy as He is holy. In looking at the biblical text, Christians will be reminded that justification is provided at no cost to them. Theyll see theres room for failure in the Christian life. But theyll also learn where theres great grace, theres great accountability--and great reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is wonderful to see this fresh look at many of the grace issues at a popular level. Mark Spencer has given us an insightful look into the implications of grace in the task of evangelism and discipleship. Recommended reading!!&lt;br /&gt;
--Dr. Joseph Dillow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Spencer has the wonderful ability to communicate deep biblical truths in an interesting and straightforward way. The reader will find a clear articulation of the grace message and convincing arguments against those who have corrupted it. I am glad to see this comprehensive and persuasive presentation of the gospel of grace and its implications. It will serve us well as we seek to share this message with the world.&lt;br /&gt;
--Dr. Charlie Bing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book that needs to be taken seriously as a helpful guide to developing a strategic plan to be servants of Christ in our areas of influence.  As Mark said, his last 25 years as a police officer went by overnight - so how fast will the years fly by in our lives? We all have a mission and an obligation to be useful to the Master.&lt;br /&gt;
--Dr. John South&lt;/p&gt;" />
