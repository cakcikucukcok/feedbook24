  <title>Become Whole, Unbreakable, and Unstoppable - Ann B. Makena</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Become Whole, Unbreakable, and Unstoppable, is an engaging text to help readers stop being led by worldly circumstances and instead discover their purposes in Christ. She articulates a plan to support the readers inner healing, solidify inner strength, and guidance to successfully pursue life dreams. The key aspect of this book is getting in touch with real self and finding the peace that defeats the outer circumstances. She invites readers to look within and to God for their purpose finding not only their true selves but peace, joy, happiness and hope for the future.&lt;p&gt;
Her poignant messages are so important to help navigate the difficult times that every person encounters at some time in their life. Thank you Ann for sharing your wisdom and understanding with all of us.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;By Dr. Ann Milz, MD, M.P.H, Pediatrician, HealthEast Clinic-Tamarack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ann Makena, the author of &lt;i&gt;Knowing And Yielding To The Voice That Counts&lt;/i&gt;
, an account of her personal challenges, has now written about sources of inner strength and inner contentment that prevail over the vicissitudes of life.  Ann Makenas qualifications to address the topic are well outlined in her previous book.  The current book provides more detail on what enables a person to navigate stormy waters with serenity and inner peace.&lt;br&gt;
