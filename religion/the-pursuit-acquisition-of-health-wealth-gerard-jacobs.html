  <title>The Pursuit &amp; Acquisition of Health &amp; Wealth - Gerard Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The pursuit and acquisition of health and wealth are part of the worldview that drives Singaporean society. It encompasses a strong work ethic in the pursuit to modernise and be a key player in the global economy. Health and wealth are defined in terms of an individuals well-being in the sense of good health and a continued assurance of material provision and security. This worldview stems from a syncretism with non-Christian religions that have reconceptualised themselves with the socioeconomic and political goals of Singaporean society. Subsequently they continue to be the authentic expression of the noblest longings of people that have become symbiotic with their daily expressions shaping their history and culture.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The book attempts to show that while Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity have played a significant role in the growth of contemporary Singaporean churches, it has inadvertently presented a gospel that appeals to the deeply embedded dominant religious secular worldview of its society in the context of health and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
