  <title>Knowing the Infinite Creator - Angel V. Ornedo Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If  you  live  as  a  purpose,  objective  driven  person,  a  human  being  of  persistence and  substance,  you  will  find  this  book    very  informative,  a  perspective  of  how  to  be  successful  in  any  of  your  positive  endeavours,   spiritual  in  objectivity,  scientific  in perspective  and  written  with  a  real  eye  for  service  to  other  people.  If  your  desires  are  only  material  in  nature,  this  may  not  fit  your  profile  as  this  book  is  a  combination  of  success  of   spiritually and  scientifically  driven  people,  materially  and  spiritually  with  a  major  touch  of  helping  other  people  as  this  is  the  real  intention  of  the  writer,  learning  and  knowing  how  to  serve  others  as  service  to others  is  service  to  the  CREATOR.  Abundance  is a  positive   way  of  helping  people  and  the  Universe  supplies  everyone  this  wealth  continuously, endlessly   and  without  exhaustion!!
	Chapters  I,  II  and  III  are  devoted  to  our  Maker,  the  Infinite Creator,  Infinity,  the Source Energy  and  names  he  is  often  called   ALL  THERE  IS/ALL  THAT  IS.  God  gave  us  free  will  and  no one,  not  even  the Angels  and  the  Higher Beings,  RA, Christ  or  other  Icons   can  violate  this, otherwise they will  come  back  to  the Wisdom vibration  and  density  of  soul  development.  We  have  guardians,  confederates  and  spiritual  guides  who  are  always  there  to  guide  us  but  they  can  never  violate  this  rule,  FREE  WILL is   given  to  us  humans  and  all the  entities  of  creation be  they  at  the  4th  or  the  seventh  density  of  existence.
	Human  beings  have  a  penchant  for  discovery  of  things  that  have  been  discovered  in  the  past.  We  always  say  we  discovered,  innovated  or  created  when  in  fact  as  you  read  from  artifacts  of  yore   or  the  libraries  of  Nineveh  discovered  in  Southern  Iraq or  Mesopotamia,  almost  everything  we  have  today  have  been  discovered  or are  in  use  during  those  times  including  lap tops, geodetic laser  measuring  devices,   jet planes,  helicopters,  airplanes  even  tractors. Tractors  are  described  as  roaring  machines  that  cultivates  the  soil  in Africa.   Take   it   from  author Zechariah   Sitchin  and  you  will  wonder.  Thus  the  human  being  is  a  Creator  itself  created  by  the  Maker  to create  beautiful  things  so  Infinity  can  experience  it  thru  us.  We   even   duplicated  and  know  and  applied  in  our  power  systems the  basic  creation  of God,  Fusion.  
The  olden  civilizations,  that  in Egypt,  and the Americas  are  filled  with  facts  that  detail  achievements  of  the  human  race  and  teachings  that  are  truth  but  today  have  been  adulterated  to  appear  as  possible  witchcraft  when  in  fact  are  real  descriptions  of  the  Law  of  One  taught  by   the  golden  people  of  Venus,  that  of  RA  social  memory  complex  and  the  higher  beings  of  nearby  stars  which  can  be  seen  at  our  dark  night  stars of Arcturus and  Sirius.  The  Orion  star  are of  the negative  origin  and  their  teachings  are  yes,  negatives  like  that one  we  call  Yahweh  who  masquerade teaching  positive  but  in  the  real  sense negative.  Again  these  are  the  teachings  of    Thou  Shalt  Not as  it  gives to  you    the  negatives.    Why        would   you  teach  thou  shalt  not  kill!  You  can  simply  say  Though shall  love  thy  neighbour  as  you  love  thyself!  This   is   the   positive  way,  never  an  inkling  of  bad  that  will  definitely  sink  in  our  one  year  old  brain,  always  a  year  old  so says the adept.
Our  world  has  been  a  belligerent,  troubled  civilization   as  far  as  my  memories can  remember, World War  I,  II and  the Cold War,   from  my  childhood  to  the  present.  The  nuclear  bombs  stored in  various  countries  o" />
