  <title>God and the Human Environment - Osunkwo Jude Thaddeus Ikenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;God and the Human Environment: Catholic Principles of Environmental Stewardship as a Template for Action in Nigeria&lt;/I&gt; brings into conversation the Churchs theological reflection on the mandate to care for Gods creation and the circumstances of the environment in Nigeria. In vivid terms and with systemic thinking, Fr. Jude Osunkwo, a theologian who specializes in Environmental Studies and Pastoral Catechesis, explores the biblical, theological, magisterial, and doctrinal bases that underlie a faithful response to contemporary environmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting the stage with a summation of the issues and a survey of significant ecclesiastical statements on the topic of the environment, &lt;I&gt;God and the Human Environment&lt;/I&gt; addresses Catholic theological principles of stewardship, Christian responsibility, and the ethics of development. Then the discussion turns to the environment of Nigeria, assessing its current state and reviewing the causes and consequences of environmental challenges before proposing pastoral responses for the Church. Finally, some chapters address likely developments in Nigeria and the Church. An extensive bibliography and several appendices provide additional support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;God and the Human Environment&lt;/I&gt; is a rigorously researched and passionately presented exploration of the issues growing out of the environmental circumstances Nigerians currently face. Whether you live in Nigeria or count yourself as a member of the Catholic Church and live somewhere else, &lt;I&gt;God and the Human Environment&lt;/I&gt; explores a topic that promises to make a difference in your life and to protect the part of the environment that God has created for you to tend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
