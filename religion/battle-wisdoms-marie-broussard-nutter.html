  <title>Battle Wisdoms - Marie Broussard Nutter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You will discover the seven God-given prime directives to keenly observe while going through any conflict. These directives will help you keep focus as the battle rages on. Learn what every Christians battle cry should always be no matter what the situation. Repeating this anthem will inspire us to look squarely at our savior for assistance and deliverance and nobody else.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the right questions to ask the Lord in prayers during any spiritual battle is key. The author reveals these crucial questions to help you advance to the next level of battle that awaits you. Discover how to execute the proper spiritual weapon to bring about a better outcome.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Employ the most effective breakthrough armaments such as fasting, prayers, speaking in tongues, the Lords joy for strength, merry-heartedness as medicine, as well as using Gods Word as powerful affirmations, and journaling to chronicle and reflect on how the Lord delivered victories to us for his glory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battalion assessments will expose how to strike a balance during heated warfare, recognize when to stand still and when to move, keeping silent as opposed to speaking, and always being ready to extend a branch of peace while poised to fight can help the Lord accelerate a battles ending.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ensure true spiritual success as you discover the dire reasons to enlist in Gods great army. The most crucial reason is that Gods army uses the process of enlistment for success, while the enemy craftily drafts his unwitting subjects for a useless, losing outcome. Choosing a particular side helps us to actively participate in aligned mindsets and goals to win what we believe in. This also shows that we have, without a doubt, chosen a designated leader. Well fight very foolishly and be void of a distinguishable target if we dont first know who weve allied ourselves with. Joshua 24:15 KJV says, Choose ye this day who you will serve . . . Joshua declared in his farewell address. Choose a side now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
