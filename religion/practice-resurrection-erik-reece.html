  <title>Practice Resurrection - Erik Reece</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;A student of Wendell Berry and Guy Davenport, Erik Reece is a strong and eloquent voice for a new generation of dedicated activists fighting on behalf of the embattled wilderness and the future of our planet. A master of the personal essay, his work has also deeply explored the role of religion in the American family. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Reece’s new collection of essays, &lt;EM&gt;Practice Resurrection&lt;/EM&gt;, ideas are the main characters. Written over ten years, and revealing Reece’s continued obsession with religion, family and the natural world, in many ways these essays represent a sequel to his stirring memoir, &lt;EM&gt;An American Gospel: On Family, History and the Kingdom of God&lt;/EM&gt;. In that book, Reece intimately describes his conflicted relationship with Christianity in the context of the death of his father, a Baptist minister from rural Virginia who committed suicide at age thirty-three, and Reece’s own journey since then to find meaning and balance in the material and spiritual worlds. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Approaching variably through the lenses of travel, economics, and environmental stewardship, and with the ideas of great American thinkers (Thoreau, Berry, Davenport, Emerson) echoing in the background, &lt;EM&gt;Practice Resurrection&lt;/EM&gt; provide readers refreshing new ways to value human spirituality and the natural environment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
