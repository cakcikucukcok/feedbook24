  <title>The Riches of His Glory - Magnus Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The books title is captivating; all will want to know his glory and the content of his riches. The book is written in five parts in a lucid and clear language. The content is well researched; all the information is Bible-based.
Most impressive is part five: Christians should believe the report of the Lord embedded in the Bible  His written word, as the author asserted. The authors style is also impressive as he brought his personal testimony right at the end, only to buttress his experience in participating in various mode of worship by the main denominations: Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, and Charismatic.
In a subtle way, he corrected critics who are biased or prejudiced about other mode of worship. To quote: 
All denominations in Christianity, worship God in a slightly different way but rather each does it in accordance with Gods word. In no way can these denominations operate in the same order of worship because the Bible makes a clear distinction on the different methods of worship which I believe is the order of Heaven.
He was able to bring out the diversified talents in which Christians made music a thing of joy in Gods houseeach unique to its own task.
&quot;The book is informative, inspirational and stimulating... It is highly recommended for theologians, students as well as lay people. It can be appealing to Christians and Non-Christians as all will be exposed to the wonderful revelation of The Riches of the Glory of God.&quot;

&quot;As I read this book, my trust, confidence and belief in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross increased considerably. Salvation plan is so explicit in this book that I believe that whosoever reads this book his faith and trust in the finished work of Christ will be increased.&quot;

&quot;Riches of His Glory  a rich text of Gods assurance of love in showing how He rescued man from darkness into his marvellous light &quot;
Olivet C. R. Williams
Editor &amp; Mum, Sydney, Australia
The author clearly explained in this masterpiece work of the art of writing the eternal plan of God in rescuing mankind from the state of eternal condemnation to eternal victory in Christ. His message is so clear and direct that whosoever reads it would be in the position to make a decisive change in the way of life in order to attain glory both now and in heaven with God. It is a book of eternal value not to be missed.

&quot;Man disobeyed God Almighty who created him and hence, he suffered agony and misery. However, God in his mercy sent Jesus to redeem man and grant him eternal life if he accepts what God has done. The story of mercy and restoration is worth reading. Magnus Williams has not only made new the timeless story of sin but has also reminded readers that salvation though free is available if they fully accept God in their lives. The story of salvation is never old.&quot;
