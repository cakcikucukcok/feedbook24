  <title>Without Cause - Samson N. Gitau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Without Cause: Job Finds God in Pain and Suffering by Dr. Samson N. Gitau explores the unsettling problem of pain and suffering. Coping with pain and suffering, whether our own or of those close to us, is most unsettling. More so when sold to the ancient theology of retribution that pain and suffering are punitive or to the modern heresy that we are somehow exempted from pain, suffering, poverty and all just because we are good and God-fearing persons. Tapping on his personal experience as a stroke survivor, his pastoral ministry and teaching career as a college professor in humanities, and particularly his studies in the book of Job, Dr. Gitau explores the Book of Job as a paradigm of human suffering. Every human being will have, at one time or another, deal with pain, suffering, and eventual demise. Its not a question of if but when. Rather than rush to the question Why me? or even indict God for our suffering, its more plausible to ask ourselves, What lessons does God want us to learn from the most trying experiences of our lives? More importantly, be assured that God bears the anguish of our pain and walks with us as we face the fiery ordeals of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
