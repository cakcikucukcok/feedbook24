  <title>Difficult Gospel: The Theology of Rowan Williams - Mike HigtonMike Higton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rowan Williams is widely recognized as a creative and powerful theologian, but his theological writings are frequently complex and difficult. This book provides a clear and simple guide to all the main themes of his theology, and shows how they are related to his reading of the Bible, his careful and wide-ranging engagement with the Christian tradition, and his grappling with contemporary culture. It shows how the Archbishop&#39;s ideas about peace or about popular culture, about sexuality or about evangelism, relate to his understanding of the nature of the life of God, and the challenging good news of Jesus Christ.  This book is designed especially for those who have no formal training in theology or academic expertise, but are interested in finding out more about what Rowan Williams stands for." />
