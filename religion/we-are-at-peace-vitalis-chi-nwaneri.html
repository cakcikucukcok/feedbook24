  <title>We   Are   at   Peace - Vitalis Chi Nwaneri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this Book the Author continues his reflections on the growing global  crises  between Faith in God and Peace on earth . Having concluded his review of the global wars, crises and conflicts between Christianity and Secularity in his ten Books on WE ARE AT WAR , he  turns in this Book  to reflect on the Peace promised by Christ to His Followers. Over two thousand years ago , Christ said to His followers ,  I have come to bring you peace , the peace that the world cannot give. 
He also said, 
 I have come to bring wars between father and mother, brother and sisters, daughters and in-laws .
The Author reflects on these apparent contradictory statements. He takes a journey across the world  to view the state of Peace and Faith  in the past half a century. He concludes from  the evidence of the global experience in the last fifty  years period fully supports Christs statements. He then wonders why the Secular world forgets this fact and continues to drive Christ and His teaching out of their lives and public governance . 
He attributes this to the work of  Satan , Gods only enemy .Enlightening the secular world on these facts is one of the challenges facing the Mission of the New Evangelization recently declared by Pope Emeritus, Benedict XVI. Through these Books, the Author  contributes to that Mission. He brings into his Books, his personal global experience gained from his travels to many of the nations across the world which are victims of the Global crises between Faith and Peace. He provides the following examples. In Europe, the nation of Yugoslavia is no longer in the world map.
 In the Muslim nations of the Middle East, historic cities like Damascus and Bagdad are now in ruins while other nations like Egypt and Israel are under threat because of growing conflicts between Peace and Faith. The Imperial nations before the coming of Christ like Persia, Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt and Greece are mere dreams today of their global power before Christ. Peaceful Governance continues to escape the nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tunisia,  Sudan, and Somalia .
In the advanced Nations of America and Europe millions of innocent children are killed every year by their own mothers before they can even see sunlight. The Communist nations like North Korea continue with the Pre-Christ rule of enslavement  of their people and oppression and persecution of Christians . The developing nations of Africa and Latin America continue to be devastated by political corruption and the reign of armed youth gangs that are victims of drug and human trafficking and assassinations. 
 Against these crises of Peace in the secular world , the Author views the continuing reign of Christs Peace amongst His followers. He concludes by reminding the world of their real enemy, Satan who had been the enemy of God and man since creation of the world. As we stated in these Books, Satan cannot bring Peace to the world but only wars, crises, Lies, Deceptions and False Promises as he did to Adam and Eve .  The Author therefore reminds the world through these Books that God is the true source of their Peace on earth. The Author therefore calls on them to turn back to Faith in One, Almighty and Loving God . It is Satan that they should drive out of the secular square and not God." />
