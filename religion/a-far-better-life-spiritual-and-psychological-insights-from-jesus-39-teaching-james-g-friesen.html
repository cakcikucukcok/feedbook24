  <title>A Far Better Life: Spiritual and Psychological Insights from Jesus&#39; Teaching - James G. Friesen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sermon on the Mount is not supposed to read like a collection of standards that we should be striving to achieve. Listen to the Master&#39;s voice. It is not saying, You should do better! It is saying, Let me help you do better. Soft and welcoming, yet compelling, Jesus invites us to make Him our guide. The Sermon on the Mount is where we learn to take our first steps. A Far Better Life opens up The Sermon on the Mount with such clarity that readers can almost hear Jesus delivering it. Staying with everyday language and common sense concepts, Dr. Friesen connects Jesus&#39; central ideas, point by point, with Christian counseling. This is one of those books that will be around for a long time, because it is both an introduction to Christian counseling and a troubleshooting volume for counselors and their clients. Here is Jesus&#39; message: The Father eagerly wants to join you in your living space to provide healing for the wounds that keep you from living a far better life. Jesus&#39; intent is for you to invite the Father into every area of your life, especially into the most difficult moments. He will transform them and that will entirely change the way you live." />
