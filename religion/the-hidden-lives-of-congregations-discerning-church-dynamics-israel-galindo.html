  <title>The Hidden Lives of Congregations: Discerning Church Dynamics - Israel Galindo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Faced with crisis, lack of direction, or just plain &amp;quot;stuckness,&amp;quot; many congregations and their leaders are content to deal only with surface issues and symptoms&amp;mdash;only to discover that the same problems keep recurring, often in different, and more serious, ways. In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Hidden Lives of Congregations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Christian educator and consultant Israel Galindo takes leaders below the surface of congregational life to provide a comprehensive, holistic look at the corporate nature of church relationships and the invisible dynamics at play. Informed by family systems theory and grounded in a wide-ranging ecclesiological understanding, Galindo unpacks clearly the factors of congregational lifespan, size, spirituality, and identity and shows how these work together to form the congregation&amp;rsquo;s hidden life. He provides useful tools for diagnosing and understanding how one&amp;rsquo;s congregation fits into the various categories he names and suggests what leadership skills are necessary to get beyond the impasse of surface issues and help the congregation achieve its mission. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Hidden Lives of Congregations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; provides one of the most far-reaching looks into the invisible nature of faith communities written in recent years. For seminaries and divinity schools, it provides a standard text for getting a solid start in congregational practices; for experienced pastors, it provides support for renewing ministry; for lay leaders and committees, it offers insight to deepening mutual ministry. Israel Galindo has written an indispensable manual that leaders will return to repeatedly for new wisdom and guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
