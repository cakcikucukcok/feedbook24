  <title>Gospel Deeps - Jared C. Wilson, Matt Chandler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While pastoring for the past fifteen years, Jared Wilson has become known in contemporary evangelicalism for his passionate, gospel-centered writing and teaching. Following Wilson&amp;rsquo;s well-received publication of &lt;em&gt;Gospel Wakefulness&lt;/em&gt;, he writes &lt;em&gt;Gospel Deeps&lt;/em&gt; as a &amp;ldquo;next step&amp;rdquo; to establishing the need for astonishment, which begins by looking at the astonishing things God has done in and through Christ. Wilson holds up the gospel like a diamond and examines it facet by facet, demonstrating the riches of its implications. This book serves as a valuable contribution to the emerging canon of gospel-centered literature, in the spirit of John Piper&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Pleasures of God&lt;/em&gt; and Tim Keller&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on a &amp;ldquo;robust gospel,&amp;rdquo; and continues in the glory-reveling legacy left by Jonathan Edwards, John Owen, and the like. The distinctiveness of &lt;em&gt;Gospel Deeps&lt;/em&gt; is found in Wilson&amp;rsquo;s winsome and frequently ecstatic writing voice, as well as his unique approach to showcasing the gospel&amp;rsquo;s beauty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
