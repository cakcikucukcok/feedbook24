  <title>I Saw That - Tracie Jack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God is always involved in our lives, but often we dont notice, too busy with our own agenda to appreciate what He is doing for us. In her book I Saw That, Tracie shares some poignant events in her life where she was able to see Gods hand interceding in her life in divine, life-changing ways. This is a well-written, engaging narrative that will provide valuable biblical insights on how you, too, can say, I saw that when God intervenes in your life.&lt;br /&gt;
- Bob Russell, Retired Senior Minister of Southeast Christian Church&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Everybody wants a miraclea Red Sea to be parted, a giant to be slayed, a mountain to be moved. And while God can still part seas, take down giants, and move mountains, often the most significant miracle is that God chooses to walk with His children in the daily grind of life  that He knows our prayers before we speak them and knows the number of hairs on our head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Saw That&lt;/em&gt; is about the miracle of the minutiae. We rarely miss the big things God does or the ways He answers our big, bold prayers, but we rarely see the small ways He cares for usspeaks to us and dances over usmostly because we arent looking. But God is at work daily in the ordinary and mundane, bringing all things together for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its never a matter of whether or not He is faithful. Its always a matter of whether or not we see it. If youre a follower of Jesus, this book will strengthen your faith. If youre not quite sure you believe in God, it may just change your mind!&lt;/p&gt;" />
