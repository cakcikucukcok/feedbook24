  <title>If We Screw Each Other, We’Re All Screwed - Peter G. James Sinclair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To be wise, one must spend time with the wise. And how does one become wise? One way is by learning from all the foolish things one has done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success in life is not a seamless highway; that road has bumps. To become an authority on this, Peter G. James Sinclair has led a life that has been a series of stops, starts, fast bursts, long hauls, desert treks, jungle manoeuvres, and a whole lot more. And yet even when a brick wall has stood between him and success, he has learnt to stand back, size up the opposition and simply shout, There must be another way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And do you know what? There always is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If We Screw Each Other, Were All Screwed: A Book on Getting Earthly Wisdom is the result of a life lived in the real world dealing with real people. Within its pages, more than five decades of tried and tested wisdom has been compacted into short, concise and easily digestible phrases that have been designed for immediate application to your life. Some would call them quotes. Peter calls them liquid gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to reach success in life and have successful relationships in this world, one must acquire and administer earthly wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
