  <title>A Condition of the Heart - Daniel Hoffman, Arlene Engelhardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book offers compelling evidence that the true Church of Jesus is not of this world (John 18:36). The writers have collected a convincing body of factual information (using both biblical as well as secular references) that clearly reveals the true nature of God&#39;s kingdom in the earth.
Never before has the gospel been made clearer! 
	Have you ever thought about what you believe and why you believe it?
	Have you ever wondered if organized religion is the way to get to heaven?
	Do you know that there are over twenty-five thousand different Christian denominations?
	Is it possible to grow in the Lord without attending church?
	Do you desire a personal relationship with Jesus Christ?
	Do you want to know who the antichrist is?
If you want to know what the Bible says concerning these things, you must read this book. Find Jesus Christ for yourselves and learn to follow him!" />
