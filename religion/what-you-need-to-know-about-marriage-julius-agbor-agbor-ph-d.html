  <title>What You Need to Know About Marriage - Julius Agbor Agbor Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God, not you, made marriage. His Spirit inhabits even the smallest details of marriage  
Malachi 2:15 (MSG)&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidifying the family structurethrough properly established marriagesis the key to both poverty alleviation and better-functioning communities.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From this revelation was born this book, What You Need to Know about Marriage. The timeliness of this book cannot be overemphasized, in the context of the growing divorce rate in the Church today, which is fast competing with that in the world. Even more compelling is the scientific evidence linking poverty and many societal vicessuch as suicide, crime, drug addiction, and school underachievementto growth in single-parent households in the United States. If we want to see fewer suicides, less gun violence, less drug addiction, and lower school dropout rates in our communities, the Lords instruction is that we must rethink the basis of our marriage culture to realign it with Gods original framework.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, this book appeals to both individuals and policymakers. For folks who are contemplating a marriage or divorce decision, this is the book you have been waiting for! Parents, church ministers, and marriage counselors may also find this an invaluable resource.&lt;p&gt;" />
