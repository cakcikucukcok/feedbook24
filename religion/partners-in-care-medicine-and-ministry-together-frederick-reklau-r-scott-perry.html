  <title>Partners in Care: Medicine and Ministry Together - Frederick Reklau, R. Scott Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The needs for and the benefits of holistic health care--care that extends to the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of individuals--have been well known for 2,500 years or so. But still, to quote the late Rodney Dangerfield, some caregivers don&#39;t get no respect. Fred Reklau is out to change that with this book, offered as an exploration of the synergies possible among those who care for persons. In the 1980s he wrote the theses that formed the core of this book. Since then they have helped many, in groups and singly, to see their work in a new light. Chaplains, pastors, parish nurses, lay caregivers, hospice workers--all will rejoice to read this heartfelt plea to elevate them to equal status with the vital care-giving services performed by physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other members of the medical professions." />
