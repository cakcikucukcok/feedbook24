  <title>Dying, Grief, and the Other Side - Judith A. Sommerville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We all have to face death. Although its inevitableor perhaps because its inevitable death can be our biggest fear. And when we fear death, we cant be there for others in their times of transition.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Author Judith A. Sommerville like most of us, she feared death. But ironically, she found funeral industry. Eventually became a palliative caregiver and natural therapist. &lt;i&gt;Dying,Grief, and the Other Side: Assistance with Making Peace and Transitioning with Dignity&lt;/i&gt; is the result of her providing twenty-five years of professional and passionate end-of-life care.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Judith has a unique, panoramic view of the needs of the dying, the relief that natural and complementary therapies can provide, the scientific theories and personal explanations of near-death experiences, and the grieving processes families undergo after the death of a loved one.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dying, Grief, and the Other Side: Assistance with Making Peace and Transitioning with Dignity&lt;/i&gt; will help you release the fear that surrounds death. For once it is eased, that space can be filled with love, acceptance, and peace. When the stages of dying and grief are understood and discussed openly and with compassion, this vulnerable, uncertain time will become a respectful celebration of life rather than an anxious denial of demise.&lt;/P&gt;" />
