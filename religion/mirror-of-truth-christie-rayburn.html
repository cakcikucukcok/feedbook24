  <title>Mirror of Truth - Christie Rayburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who Do You See In The Mirror?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a young woman who is strong and confident? Or, do you see someone who feels insecure and somehow not enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a courageous lady living each day fully and freely? Or, do you see someone who is weighed down with emotional baggage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a Christ-follower passionate about making a difference? Or, do you see someone who is defined by the current culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time. No more filling the voids of your soul with exhausting and empty substitutes.  God wants you to look into His Mirror of Truth and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidify your confidence in your Christ-given identity  Tenaciously fight for your spiritual &amp; emotional freedom Powerfully influence this world with your unique voice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this six-week Bible study, specifically written for young women ages 16 to 25, you have the opportunity to be emotionally and spiritually transformed during this critical time in your life. You will get to the real issues of your heart and be mentored by His truth as you &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Bravely confront your past &amp; how it has impacted you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Examine your soul to determine your lifes core values &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Make realistic plans to live out your God-given dreams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Each lesson encourages you to dig deep into Gods Word and take a real look at yourself by guiding you through the unique process of stopping, looking, asking, and changing. Experience for yourself the Mirror of Truth, and the truth will set you free.&lt;/p&gt;" />
