  <title>A Layman’S Commentary Volume 2 - John Devine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays world, it can be difficult to maintain your faith. Those seeking a greater understanding of the Bible have numerous excellent theological commentaries available to them, but due to volume and depth, many of these are out of reach of laypeople. Others lose contact with the Bible, because it no longer seems relevant to life. They use a superficial knowledge of science and evolution to exclude God and faith from their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Laymans Commentary: Volume 2Books of the History&lt;/i&gt; presents a passage  by-passage explanation of the twelve books of the Bible, known as History. In this second volume, author John Devine covers biblical passages from the Entry into Canaan to the end of the Monarchy and the Return of the Remnant. He explains Gods continued self-revelation and plan for a relationship with humankind in his dealings with the nation of Israel. He considers the conflict and consequences of the desire of the individual to be independent from God. Further understanding of Gods moral standard, which has been the backbone of Western society, is given. Devine also lays out the basis for a full and rewarding relationship with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book in &lt;i&gt;The Laymans Commentary series, Volume 2Books of History&lt;/i&gt; provides many proven principles for life and leadership. Devine presents examples from life based on characters and situations. They confirm science and faith are complementary in giving purpose and meaning to life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
