  <title>Unveiling Theological and Doctrinal Concepts - Rev. Oscar García, Ana M. Coppin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the present, the Christianity is going through a time of much confusion of false apostles and false prophets, along with false teachings and erroneous interpretations of the Bible. The churches have been infiltrated by homosexuality and bizarre cults; the moral crises at all levels in our society, the ravening crime, rapes of children, and family violence all demonstrate the urgent need that the Christian people have to seek in prayer for Gods intervention to heal human beings from their terrible spiritual condition.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, the reader will find concepts that may help him to grow and to get stronger spiritually. Here is a brief list of the many topics covered in this book:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than three hundred Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah that were fulfilled in Jesus Christ
	The deity from eternity of the Begotten Son of God that can be seen in both the Old and the New Testament
	The evidence of the fullness of the Holy Spirit
	The return of Jesus by the saints in the Old Testament, as well as in the New Testament, and the prophecies that demonstrate the rapture of the heirs of the kingdom of heaven of the born-again believers
	The prophecies about the millennium and the time of its fulfillment
	The security of the salvation of the kingdom of heaven of the children of God
	The judgment of the nations and the White Throne judgment
	The resurrection of the dead in the Millennium
	The resurrection of the dead and the judgment of condemnation for the impious&lt;p&gt;" />
