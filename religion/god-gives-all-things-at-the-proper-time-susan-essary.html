  <title>God Gives All Things at the Proper Time - Susan Essary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the first sign of the light given to my spirit at the awakening and quickening of my soul, my mind has sought diligently to know the one true God. He is the Designer and Creator of all things.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My satisfaction will only be found in and by the will of God. My soul belongs to him who is trustworthy. Therefore, with these words put forth in my book, I hope you will find a delight for your edification. I pray that if you are also a child of God, my stories will connect with you in a like-minded way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the moments in my life, past and present, where he moves within me the desire to write them down, and so I do. This is not your typical storybook in which you will read one story from beginning to end. The book contains many stories about a girl named Heather, my daughter. The story of her and her pony are intermingled throughout my book with poems and memoirs (the writers experiences as lived).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life (as was yours) was well thought out in the mind of God. The pages you hold are some of my documented experiences of his thoughts that he has shared with me, lived out through a gift of life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was to have originally been a childrens book, but as I began to write, it proved to be more for an adult audience. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also includes some Bible scripture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
