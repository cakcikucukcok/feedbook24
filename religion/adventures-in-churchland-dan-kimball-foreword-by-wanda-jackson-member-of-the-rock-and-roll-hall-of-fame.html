  <title>Adventures in Churchland - Dan Kimball, Foreword by Wanda Jackson, Member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Would Jesus Attend Church Today?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Among the top ten trends that are changing American life, Time magazine recently listed a rising dissatisfaction with organized religion. Though many people today like Jesus, they are growing tired of traditional religious institutions. Even those who follow Jesus aren&#39;t so sure they always like what Christianity and the church represent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For many years, Dan Kimball would have agreed, until an encounter with a small group of Jesus followers started him on a journey that challenged him to rethink everything he had ever assumed about the church.&amp;amp;nbsp; In &lt;EM&gt;Adventures in Churchland&lt;/EM&gt;, Dan invites you to join him as he uncovers what the Bible really says about the church and reminds us that it’s more than just buildings and institutions, it’s a beautiful mess of broken people learning to follow Jesus together. As you journey with Dan, you’ll begin to see the church as Jesus intended it to be: a community of forgiven misfits coming together to serve the world around them with passion, creativity, innovation, and grace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;If you don’t like the church, or if you’re thinking about leaving, please read this book first. Dan’s stories will make you laugh, make you think, and make you appreciate the church like never before.&quot; – Mark Batterson, author of The Circle Maker&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;“As a non-Christian, I was inspired and moved, and have been enthusiastically recommending it to my friends. This is a book for everybody.&quot; – Mark Frauenfelder, editor-in-chief of MAKE, founder of boingboing.net&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Dan encourages us to break through the tension and messiness that church communities inevitably encounter to experience the beauty of being in community and sharing God&#39;s infinite love with others.&quot; – Zach Lind, drummer, Jimmy Eat World&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;I am so glad that my friend Dan has written this book, because there is a lot of confusion out there about Jesus and the church.&quot; – Wanda Jackson, Queen of Rockabilly and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/P&gt;" />
