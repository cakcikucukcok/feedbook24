  <title>More Than a Conqueror - Porcia Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hopeless. One word could describe the condition of my life as I sat on the edge of my bed in my tenth and final treatment center. Death seemed to be the best and only solution for the mess I&amp;rsquo;d made and the life I&amp;rsquo;d destroyed. There had always been a light at the end of the tunnel &amp;ndash; some glimmer of hope that a better day would come. Until now. I&amp;rsquo;d prayed many times in my life, but never this prayer:&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Lord, I give up. Just take my life. Please, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to live anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;d lost everything in my addiction.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;d become accustomed to, and quite frankly very skilled at, picking up the scattered pieces of my broken life. When I was 20 I moved from my hometown in Minnesota to Florida to try to escape my druggie friends and lifestyle. I thought getting enough miles between us would solve all my problems. For a while, it did. But the problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t them. It was me.&amp;nbsp; Something inside of me &amp;ndash; a dangerous, evil, unquenchable thirst for the thrills of drugs and alcohol &amp;ndash; a monster so strong and so powerful I thought killing myself was the only way to get rid of it for good. Chaos and crisis were a regular part of my existence. I can&amp;rsquo;t even keep track of all the times I tried to move away for a fresh start.&amp;nbsp; From Minnesota to Denver, back to Minnesota, to Florida, back to Minnesota again, then New York, California, and eventually back to Minnesota.&amp;nbsp; I was the queen of one-way tickets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
