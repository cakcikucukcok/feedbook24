  <title>The Church Made Flesh - Alan Todd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his book, The Church Made Flesh, Alan takes the spiritual pulse of the Pentecostal/Apostolic Church and lays bare its true condition. Tapping into a rich spiritual repertoire of experiences, both anecdotal and other erudite sources, this book is a tour de force that revisits bedrock issues such as the cost of discipleship, church-planting and church order, among others. Employing a fruitful dialectic of tension, these issues are explored in the intersection between the nascent Apostolic Church of the first century AD and its contemporary incarnation. The denouement is an incisive, accessible, candid and profound exposition that is a must in every discerning minister and laypersons library.&lt;/p&gt;
Paul Thomas, PhD (Education, Kings College, London)&lt;/br&gt;
Lecturer, University of Olso, Norway Institute for Pedagogy&lt;/br&gt;
Comparative and International Education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give yourself this book and then help God solve the next vexing problem in the North American Apostolic church. Sorry  this book is not designed to grace the shelf of your library. You should really read it on your knees. Embark on your journey with tears in your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
Bishop Paul Reynolds&lt;/br&gt;
International Honorary General Presbyter&lt;/br&gt;
United Pentecostal Church International&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church Made Flesh challenges todays commonly adopted church system of attraction by comparing it the 1st centurys church model which exercised Apostolic authority by going out to the world. Without apology Alan combats the readers thinking on how well todays church is executing the Great Commission and touching the lives of people of all nations. For those that are ready to effect change in this world the biblical way, this is a book that you must not only have but study and wrestle with.&lt;/p&gt;
