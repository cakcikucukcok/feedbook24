  <title>Why I Have to Die Like Jesus and Louis Riel? - James Prince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dozens of writers wrote about the life, the death, and the career of Louis Riel, but they have mainly written about his political activities and his rebellions. I will talk to you mainly about his relationship with God and that he had the same preoccupations as Jesus had in this world, meaning to free his people from the slavery of sin and the slavery of religion and to lead his people to God.
Louis Riel understood just like Jesus did that religions, mainly the one that has its head in Rome, are a dreadful slavery, and we definitely have to separate from them. This is the reason the John A. Macdonalds government pressed by the Christian churches found a way to eliminate him from this earth despite the protestations against this from all over.
So Louis Riel had to go through the same destiny as the one who inspired him, Jesus of Nazareth, and this is why I expect the same conclusion for myself, because I do the same thing they did, meaning opening the eyes of the blind.
Fortunately for the world and thanks to God, a bit of salt and a gleam of light made their way to me. So in one way Ill be able to continue the work of Jesuss disciples, and this is what Im doing with the help of my books." />
