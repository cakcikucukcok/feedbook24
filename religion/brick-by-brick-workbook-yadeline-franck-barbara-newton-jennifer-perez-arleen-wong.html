  <title>Brick by Brick Workbook - Yadeline Franck, Barbara Newton, Jennifer Perez, Arleen Wong...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With sixty million abortions since 1973, there are equally as many wounded hearts. They are living a life filled with painful memories, silently seeking to be healed but not knowing where to begin. These calloused hearts need the chains of anguish unlocked so healing can finally begin. This workbook offers hope for walls, which have been built over a period of time, to begin to crumble. What is behind the walls of those who have had an abortion? Where does healing begin? What does walking in freedom look like? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this workbook, the healing study for Brick by Brick Healing His Way: A Devotional and Journal for Healing a Womans Heart, are a variety of exercises that address the following: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beginning to deal with the issues behind your wall &lt;br /&gt;
Healing one wound at a time and learning to surrender all the pain &lt;br /&gt;
Surrendering all the pain for an exchange of love, acceptance, and forgiveness &lt;br /&gt;
Learning how to walk in a fortress of security that God has for your new beginning &lt;br /&gt;
Walking in victory as your heart is transformed and set free &lt;br /&gt;
Receiving a restored and renewed heart &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This study is perfect for the person who wants no one else to know, as well as a small group setting. It may be used in womens Bible study and pregnancy center. It offers healing techniques for counselors or a group of friends who share the same desire for healing. Undoubtedly, with one in three women having an abortion in their past, this workbook will surely appeal to many especially those fearful of someone finding out their secret. I invite you to walk this healing journey together one brick at a time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
