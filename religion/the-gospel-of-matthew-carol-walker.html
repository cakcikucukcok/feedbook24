  <title>The Gospel of Matthew - Carol Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of Matthew is the first book in the New Testament. It truly is a teaching Gospel. It serves as an important resource for learning about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The Apostles needed this teaching so that they could effectively form the foundation upon which the future Christian church would be built. They needed this teaching to obey the commandment which Jesus gave them: Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. (Matt.28:19-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an easy-to-understand format, The Gospel of Matthew offers an in-depth study that reveals why Christs presence forever changed the world. Author Carol Walker explores the true nature of Jesus, his mission on Earth, and his ministry. From his birth to his death and resurrection, Walker recounts Jesus life and, in so doing, reveals how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker presents thirty-four lessons that cover the twenty-eight chapters of Matthew. Each chapter is summarized to provide historical and cultural background information and a question and answer section presents an opportunity for further discussion. Lessons include the important work of the Holy Spirit, the ministry of John the Baptist, the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus interpretation of the Ten Commandments, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of Matthew presents a comprehensive study for individuals or groups. If youre seeking to expand your knowledge of Jesus life and teachings and want to deepen your faith, let this be your guide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
