  <title>The Hen - Marthus-Adden Zimboiant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Indeed many men of knowledge have written more books about leadership
using birds to relate to leadership. Surprisingly, almost these authors use
eagle, the king of birds, as an example of a good leader. That is to say, they
use the seven known important characteristics of eagle to claim that he is a good
leader, despising the other birds especially the hen. Even no one has perhaps
thought about the HEN (female domestic fowl) as being a good leader and for
that matter she need to be studied more than any other bird.
However, Marthus-Adden Zimboiant does not agree that only eagle should
be used as yardstick to measure a good leader. He has perfectly studied the
hen as leader, using both the good and the bad side of the hen to reveal the
behaviours of leaders, especially in the churches today.
What I love on this book is that it tackles everything. Every realistic situation on
every ones life is revealed in this book. After reading this book, it will enlighten
you about both good and bad leaders. For example, it will help you understand
that something you thought it was right will actually prove the opposite. This
book is informative in a way that you will be able to review every bad thing you
did, which will help you make sure you are not going to do that again in the
future. In effect, this book is a self-guide about leadership" />
