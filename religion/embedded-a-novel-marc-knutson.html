  <title>Embedded: A Novel - Marc Knutson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Steve Stanton, the Jerusalem Bureau Chief for the World Observer Gazette, has been covering events of the Middle East for many years. Stanton&#39;s adventures begin when he receives a priority assignment from his Managing Editor: Our sources tell us of a new national movement sweeping Judea. Apparently the king pin of this movement, is Yeshua bar Joseph of Nazareth See what is going on in Judea and report back! Stanton was as intrigued as he was excited about the assignment. The country was abuzz about this upstart movement and activity around Jerusalem was making the local leaders nervous. From the moment he accepted the assignment, trouble was literally at his door. Following a trail of leads, from eyewitness shepherds in Bethlehem, to religious leaders of the Jews, and even Roman soldiers and other twists and turns, Stanton catches up with and becomes embedded within the cluster of disciples. However, Stanton&#39;s task will not be easy. There are those who want to block his story. One man will warn him that his whole meaning of his existence will be to stop Stanton&#39;s mission. Many face-to-face encounters ensue, all to prevent the story of Yeshua from getting to the outside world. At almost every turn, there are attempts to stop him. The embedded journalist rubs elbows with the disciples of Yeshua and learns more, sees more, experiences more than any other person around, maybe even more than the closest of Yeshua&#39;s disciples. His &#39;exclusive&#39; access allows Stanton insight which will help explain why there is such a furor in Judea. Embedded co-mingles historical data, with plot twists, and characters that could have happened. Does Yeshua&#39;s fate bring the end of the story? The Stanton Adventures may not end here, but what direction will they go? You know what the verses in the Bible say; now let the Stanton adventures tell you what went on between the verses!" />
