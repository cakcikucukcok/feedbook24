  <title>When I See Him - Sharon C. Mo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In When I See Him, a mother recalls her journey with her firstborn son, from his anticipated conception to her eventful pregnancy that leads to his premature birth. She recounts his days at the neonatal intensive care unit and shares an intimate story of finding God in those around her for hope.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After waiting over a year to start a family, God finally blesses Sharon with a child. While there are moments of joy and excitement in her pregnancy, there are also frightful episodes that end with trips to the emergency room. Following some complications, her son is bornthirteen weeks early. Sharon and her husband suddenly find themselves with new responsibilities of parenting a preemie in a hospital environment. As they face the realities of being in the neonatal intensive care unit, they are taught to rely on Gods grace and to trust in His sovereignty, even when God gives them exactly what they need. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I See Him is a candid, hope-filled, and intensely personal account of the peaks and valleys Sharon and her husband experienced with their baby boy and a testimony of how God used their sons life in ways that were higher than their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
