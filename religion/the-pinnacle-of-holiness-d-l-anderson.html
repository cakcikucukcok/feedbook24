  <title>The Pinnacle of Holiness - D. L. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theres more to inheriting eternal life &lt;br&gt;
than what many of us have been told. &lt;br&gt;
Depending upon your level of spiritual commitment, this statement may or may not mean anything to you. But it means everything to me. Why? It is because eternal life represents the progressive alternative to endless death, the only other potential final destination of my soul. Therefore, as the soul shall subsist forever, securing eternal life should be the primary objective of every progressive existence. &lt;br&gt;
At the same time, many have been deceived into believing that inheriting eternal life is as easy as saying a simple prayer or having an undeveloped, meager level of faith. Still, the reality is that inheriting eternal life [i.e. the greatest prize of all time] will naturally require the greatest investment of all time  a life dedicated to the will of the Father which is the basis of progressive spiritualism. Accordingly, the scriptures teach us For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? [See Matthew 16:25-26]. &lt;br&gt;
In my opinion, any honest person would come to this conclusion and would rightfully (as well as willfully) desire to make the necessary investment required to obtain the prize of eternal life. The problem is that many honest believers havent been told the whole story and are preparing to go to the Judgment with many of their works undone. Consequently, the question of the hour is simply this  what more is there to the story? &lt;br&gt;
Conclusively, the answers to this inquiry are found within this volume of The Pinnacle of Holiness. Building off the former volume which provides a high-level description of the path which leads to eternal life, this volume will focus on providing detailed information about the path. Thus it should be viewed as a spiritual training manual which each sojourner soldier can employ to ensure that they are abiding by every criterion associated with inheriting eternal life. &lt;br&gt;
In the end (and with regards to the delicate matter of eternal life), the most critical factors are the instructions which the Father has revealed to us by His Spirit and recorded within His Word. Definitively, these spiritual and scriptural disclosures are contained within this volume. As the scriptures have said, And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. &lt;br&gt;" />
