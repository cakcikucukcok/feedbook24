  <title>Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell: Homosexuality, Chaplaincy, and the Modern Military - John D. Laing, Page Matthew Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The repeal of the government&#39;s policy on homosexual military service, known as Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell (DADT), has caused much concern among Christian military service members, especially chaplains, and has led to much debate about the morality of homosexuality, the ideal of free speech, and the role of clergy in public service. Can it be scientifically demonstrated that homosexuality is normal? What has homosexual political activity shown to be their agenda, if any? What does the Bible say about homosexuality? How can chaplains who disagree with the homosexual lifestyle respond to the repeal in a way that retains their prophetic voice, but protects them from prosecution? How can chaplains minister to homosexual service members and their families in a post-DADT military? These are just some of the questions addressed in this important work by a group of scholars and chaplains, many of whom serve or have served in the academy, the military, and the church." />
