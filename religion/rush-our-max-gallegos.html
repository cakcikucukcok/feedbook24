  <title>Rush Our - Max Gallegos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ability to listen and understand God is of utmost importance for humanity. Obedience through listening is crucial for a fulfilled life with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a series of experiences through listening.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Divine intervention depicts the compassion and love of our heavenly Father. This is what he does best; he heals our bodies, provides prophetic words, dreams, visions, as well as prophetic statements in and about our current time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Episodes of divine intervention will foster hope where it seems there is no hope. They are to encourage the individual whose focus is on hopeless situations. Hopeless situations such as current events in the ever-shaking economy, the gruesome events of people at war with each other, the planet itself quaking, flooding, and experiencing many extreme conditions, to say the least! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions taken by our growing society without the knowledge of God to help guide their thoughts and choices can cause a sense of unrest which hovers over this planet. Unrest is felt by both old and young alike. All of creation has been and is anticipating something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of this unrest or seemingly discouraging events taking place in your life or the lives of those around you, the love of God will prevail!&lt;/p&gt;" />
