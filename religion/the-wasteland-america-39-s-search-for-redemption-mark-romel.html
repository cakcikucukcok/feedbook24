  <title>The Wasteland: America&#39;s Search for Redemption - Mark Romel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine the Spirit of America as the Fisher King - the Maimed King - of the medieval Arthurian romances. The King is charged with preserving the Holy Grail (American greatness). But the King has been wounded in the genitals and rendered impotent. The power of the Grail is the only thing that keeps him alive. He cannot move. He is unable to perform his tasks. His kingdom suffers just as he does. His impotence stretches across all the land, affecting its fertility, devastating it and turning it into a barren wasteland. The Wounded King reigns over a cursed land. America is a Wasteland for its people. The rich elite - the 1% - are the wound that afflicts the nation and curses it. Only the plutocrats prosper in America. Only they have great and glittering opportunities. Everyone else is left to fester and rot. The masses are supposed to spend their whole lives fantasizing about success. Dream&quot;. As George Carlin said, &quot;It&#39;s called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.&quot;" />
