He is waiting on us to turn from our wicked ways and come to him. Jesus is speaking to the ones who have not given their life to him yet. I have written his spoken words and a reference that tells you it is true because its in the Bible. Yes! Jesus is real. Jesus Spirit can give you helpful hints of how he works in the spirit. Trust and believe in him and be holy, and he will take your life to a whole new level of living." />
