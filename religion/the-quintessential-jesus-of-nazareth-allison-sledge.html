  <title>The Quintessential Jesus of Nazareth - Allison Sledge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Penned by Allison Sledge, The Quintessential Jesus of Nazareth is a penetrating,
intellectually profound masterpiece of the Highest Order.
Ms. Sledge is a premier scholar of gnosticism, comparative religion, Biblical nomenclature,
symbolism, onomastics, metaphysics, kaballah, mysticism and spiritual initiation. Her
book transports the reader beyond space and time - into the mind, heart, spirit and soul of
The Master Jesus, on every conceivable level which is not generally known to the masses.
Many of the Holy Scriptures chapters and verses will be viewed from a different perspective;
as was once perceived with the universal eyes with which Jesus viewed the world, rather
than what many of the modern clergy promulgate and attempt to teach the majority of
unenlightened souls. This book is designed to enlighten each reader to depths they might
not have ever imagined
Never before has a writer dared to be so bold as to interpret the Natal Birth Chart of
Jesus Christ, a Piscean, born on March 19th, 07 BC, while elevating and re-creating
awareness, understanding and insight to completely new heights of all inclusive universal
comprehension.
This Authors book was written in a stream of consciousness with God, emanating from
her deep connection with Jesus of Nazareth. Intertwining her personal observations within
the subject matter, Allison Sledge methodically includes the works of Edgar Cayce, The
Keys of Enoch, The Aquarian Gospel and Egyptology. She engages her familiarity with
science, mathematics, planetary energies, and Biblical personalities. Her work highlights
the thread of unity, which connects the Old Testament with the New Testament in symbolic
patterns, from Genesis to Revelations.
Her goal is to be inclusive rather than exclusive, thus incorporating differing thoughts and
opinions into the ultimate reality that We Are All One, despite our conflicting beliefs;
just as Jesus taught.
Contemplating the reality and purpose of human existence surely must lead us to wonder
how we, as human beings created in the image of God, do not truly know God as Jesus.
There is a disconnection. Even more profound is the fact that Jesus, The Christ, died a
horrendous death by execution in order to instill in each one of us His everlasting message:
That we love one another as we love ourselves... Sadly, the state of the world today 
reflects the exact opposite of His hopes and wishes.
The Book, now in your hands, was given to you to know the Real Jesus of Nazareth, inside
and out, like you have never, ever known before. Enjoy it, and God Bless You." />
