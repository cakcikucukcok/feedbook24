  <title>A Most Incredible Witness - Emily L. Pittsford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On September 1, 2010, Timothy Pittsford chased a man who had just hit and killed a woman in a crosswalk. Chasing a Prius in his Eclipse through the streets of San Francisco was the biggest event of his life. Little did he know that days later he would also be dead. Yet being a witness was all part of a bigger plan. As the young man who hit the woman saw Tim in his rear view mirror, God was in Tims. Learn how Tims mother, Emily, deals with losing her son and how her faith is only strengthened by what God has done in her life, including mending her relationship with her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This manuscript chronicles the authors journey through grief to ultimate healing after suffering the loss of her son, every parents nightmare. With utmost honesty and courage, the author takes the reader through her shock, sorrow, anger, and confusion, along with sharing her familys story prior to and after her sons death. Holding nothing back, the author engages with the reader and maintains that connection throughout the manuscript. And through it all, her strong, deep faith in God is palpable and is her powerful testimony today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
