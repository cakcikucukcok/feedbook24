  <title>When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World - Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, Stanley Schachter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1954, just as the &quot;Flying Saucer Contactee&quot; movement was taking off in America, a housewife named Dorothy Martin (here renamed &quot;Mrs. Keech&quot;) began receiving messages from the Space Brothers. They told her a flood would occur on Dec. 21st that would cleave the United States in two, and kill millions. She and her circle of disciples were commissioned to warn the world, and to prepare themselves to be whisked away to safety in flying saucers. Psychologist Leon Festinger and several colleagues infiltrated the group to study the effects of failed prophecy on believers. If the world was still standing on Dec. 22nd, would they abandon their beliefs? &quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot; is a fascinating, hour by hour, inside account of the days leading up to, and following, December 21st, 1954. The New Paradigm Press edition of this classic of both UFOlogy and psychology includes a bonus image gallery, &quot;The Truth Seekers In Context: Famous Flying Saucer/Space Brother Contactee Narratives of the 1950s.&quot;" />
