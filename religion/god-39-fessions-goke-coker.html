  <title>God&#39;fessions - ‘Goke Coker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world fraught with evil, encroaching darkness, violence, strife, confusion, attacks on families, failing finances, and health,  distractions and emotional instability, mans usual reaction is that of despondency and negative proclamations. In the beginning, when God saw the darkness that covered the face of the earth, He decreed what He wanted to see rather than agree with what He saw. Since we are made in His image, rather than confessing the problem (darkness) we are to confess the solution (the WORD) thereby transforming darkness to light.
(Rom 10:10) For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Believing and confessing are  an important part of our Christian walk. What becomes manifest in our lives depends on our faith and confession. When our lips contradicts the word of God, we prevent His work in and through us, but when we get our hearts and lips in line with His word, He  manifests His grace in us and  His power flows through us.
Godfessions is the first of four compilations of inspired confessions of Gods promises. This book will help you cultivate an awareness of your spiritual blessings and the limitless power of God as well as enable you grow stronger in  your faith, as you establish the truth of Gods word over you and your household through your declarations.
