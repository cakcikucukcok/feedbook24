  <title>The Human Animal: A Revelation of Hypocrisy - Don Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a forest view or a broad summary which addresses human history as related to human nature and causes of civilization decline. It is dedicated to those &amp;quot;free thinkers&amp;quot; who are not afraid to challenge the conventional wisdom and its ignorance. The book provides a new perspective of God and creation and explores differences between faith and fact. The book reveals the misconception of human rights and other rights and the origin of all rights and how a right must be protected. A true definition of human slavery and how it relates to the human animal is discussed. The book separates true wealth or real wealth from fools wealth and parasitic wealth and suggest how each could be treated differently regarding tax policy. It is the opinion of the author who sees the present economic system of consumptive materialism used to distribute the national wealth as unsustainable in the long run because of diminishing resources. Destruction of the environment and human greed with ever human population growth is seen as the greatest danger facing humanity. The author believes that it is religious ignorance chained to ancient thought that hinders the many solutions needed for solving modern problems. It is the hope of this author that young people can take some of the ideas presented in this book and provide the systemic change desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
