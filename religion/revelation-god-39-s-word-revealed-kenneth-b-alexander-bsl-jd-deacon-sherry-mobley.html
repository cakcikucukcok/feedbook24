CHRISTIANITY&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXPLAINING the BOOK of LAMENTATIONS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHY READ the BIBLE?: IT IS GOD&amp;#39;S WORD RECORDED&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IN the DAYS of the KINGDOM &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE MARK of the BEAST&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE TRUE MEANING of CHURCH&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHY SO MANY DENOMINATIONS?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNIVERSAL LAW: How God Thinks About the Law of the Earth &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The title of this book is Revelation. Revelation is variously defined as: &amp;quot;an uncovering, a bringing to light of that which had been previously wholly hidden or only obscurely seen. God has been pleased in various ways and at different times (Heb. 1:1) to make a supernatural revelation of himself and his purposes and plans, which, under the guidance of his Spirit, has been committed to writing (Easton&amp;#39;s Dictionary). Although this book does contain an attempted interpretation of the Book of Revelation, anything God does or speaks is in and of itself revelation in that it is bringing to light something hidden. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bible is unlike any other book written by man. The bible, although written by man, is the inspired writing of that man moved by the Spirit of God and so becomes not the word of man but the Word of God. Books written by men convey emotions, ideas, entertainment, concepts and other mental images. God&amp;#39;s word brings revelation to the Spirit of man. Jesus said: &amp;quot;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&amp;quot; (John 6:33). The words are food for man&amp;#39;s spirit, just as natural food nourishes the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Revelation is highly valued in the Kingdom of God. &amp;quot;Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, &amp;quot;Who do people say that the Son of Man is?&amp;quot; And they said, &amp;quot;Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.&amp;quot; He said to them, &amp;quot;But who do you say that I am?&amp;quot; Simon Peter answered, &amp;quot;You are the Christ [Messiah], the Son of the living God.&amp;quot; And Jesus said to him, &amp;quot;Blessed are you,  Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven&amp;quot; (Matthew 16:13-19). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lord was overjoyed in that man had not talked Peter into anything regarding the Lord&amp;#39;s identity but Peter had received revelation directly from the Father. This book, along with others I have written, attempt to convey the truth of the Lord through revelation obtained from Him. The following are some odds and ends I have gathered together helping you will gain a better understanding of Him from His words. Everything said here is confirmed by scriptures from God&amp;#39;s word. I hope it opens an even clearer picture as to He is and His purpose in the earth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heavens" />
