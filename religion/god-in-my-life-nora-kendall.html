  <title>God in My Life - Nora Kendall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seldom does one pick up a book where the author was not only led by God to write it, but was provided by Him with her pen name, the book title, the names of the editors, the picture for the front cover, and the publishing company by which He wanted the book published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the book that you are now holding in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nora Kendall has presented some simple, yet faith-enhancing stories of how God moved in her life for the benefit of others. She tells of the moments in her life when God called her into action and then provided all that she needed to carry out His work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Having never written a book before, Nora relied completely on God, not only for help in writing the manuscript, but to bring this book to publication. She makes it very clear that this book is not hers, but rather Gods book, written by her hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold I stand at the door and knock. (Rev 3:20 KJV)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you feel moved by this book to respond to Gods calling in your life, then go and answer the door.&lt;/p&gt;" />
