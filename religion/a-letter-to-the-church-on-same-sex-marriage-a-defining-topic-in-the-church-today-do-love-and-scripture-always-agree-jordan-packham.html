  <title>A Letter to the Church On Same-sex Marriage: A Defining Topic In the Church Today; Do Love and Scripture Always Agree? - Jordan Packham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The spread of Christianity into new times and places throughout history has continually brought difficult issues and unforeseen challenges that do not allow the disciple of Christ to cut and paste rules from Christian tradition legalistically. New contexts force the Church to go back to love, and to Christ, in order to discern appropriate thinking and forms. Today, as this book is published, the topic of same-sex marriage is a defining topic for the Church, causing polarization and deep dialogue. This book represents a voice from within the Church today. The voice heard in this book is of one who journeyed toward taking a stronger stance on the topic of same-sex marriage. It was not a simple journey, but it was a required journey for a Christ-follower who revered scripture. May this book be a part of the reader&#39;s own journey toward truth and love, and Christ and neighbour. May the Church continually emerge from all new challenges and contexts with a sound, Christ-centred theology and message for the world." />
