  <title>Yes You Can – with God’S Help! - Denis Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The original edition of &lt;i&gt;Yes You CanWith Gods Help!&lt;/i&gt; was self-published in 1991. The cost of printing two thousand copies in full color was $12,500. At that time, after Id left teaching, that was practically all the money I had, but I believed the Lord wouldnt let me fall flat on my face. When I was due to pay that money to the printers, I went to withdraw a small amount from my savings account, and there was an additional entry of $12,380! In our little prayer group, we used to say that in any endeavor its a team effort, but we need to do our 1 percent before we can expect the Lord to provide his 99. Months after the booklet (only thirty pages then) was printed, a friend pointed out that the $120 shortfall was 1 percent of the money. The Lord had provided 99 percent of the money, in mysterious circumstances, and left me to pay the final 1 percent. Thank you, Lord!
In preparation for the publication of this expanded and updated Second Edition, at the Lords prompting, I had added to the original text five years earlier but was blocked from any further development. His perfect timing became obvious to me when I recently discovered what I consider to be the final spiritual piece of the jigsaw puzzle regarding goal-setting. I was able to include it in this edition. Again, thank you, Lord!&lt;/P&gt;" />
