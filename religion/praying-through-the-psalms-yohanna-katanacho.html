  <title>Praying Through the Psalms - Yohanna Katanacho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Join with Yohanna Katanacho, a Palestinian Israeli Christian, in praying through the Psalms.
After completing his PhD on the book of Psalms, Yohanna Katanacho felt led to pray every psalm in the context of the Middle East. These prayers transformed him. They helped him expand his understanding of Psalms as he prayed out his theology. They also enabled him to express all of his frustrations, hopes, joys, and many other emotions. His feelings were sanctified in the presence of the Lord and this experience created a healthy theology of tears in the midst of oppressive realities. Lastly, these prayers strengthened him to face the harsh realities of the Middle East from a biblical perspective.
This collection of 150 beautiful and unique prayers, inspired by each of the Psalms and birthed in the same land as Jesus, will help you grow in under- standing the struggles of Christians in the Middle East, and deepen your love for God." />
