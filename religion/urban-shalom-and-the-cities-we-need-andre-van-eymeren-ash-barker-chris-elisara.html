  <title>Urban Shalom and the Cities We Need - Andre Van Eymeren, Ash Barker, Chris Elisara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is the result of two historic events that took place in Quito, Ecuador during&lt;br /&gt; October 2016. The first was the Gospel and the Future of Cities Summit at which a&lt;br /&gt; contingent of Kingdom focused urban leaders gathered to explore what the gospel has to&lt;br /&gt; say to the development of cities globally. The participants then formed a delegation to the&lt;br /&gt; United Nation&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s Habitat III conference, joining with 45,000 city leaders, academics, NGOs&lt;br /&gt; and others from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Urban Shalom and the Cities We Need picks up the themes discussed at the summit and&lt;br /&gt; reflects on their connection to the New Urban Agenda which was ratified at Habitat III and&lt;br /&gt; sets the tone for the development of cities globally. In these pages, you will hear from&lt;br /&gt; practitioners, leaders and academics as they lead you in reflection on some of the major&lt;br /&gt; issues facing all urban environments. From years of experience the authors offer very&lt;br /&gt; practical tools on discipleship, urban planning, land use, community development and&lt;br /&gt; responding to the poor. It is our hope that their reflections and tools will enable you and your&lt;br /&gt; networks to engage in crucial conversations with others about the physical and social&lt;br /&gt; development of your neighborhoods, communities and cities. And that together we can all&lt;br /&gt; work on the creation of great spaces and places that reflect God&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s desire for us all to&lt;br /&gt; experience shalom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
