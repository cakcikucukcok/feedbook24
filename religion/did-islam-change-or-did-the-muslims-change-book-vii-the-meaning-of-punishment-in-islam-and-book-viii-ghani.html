  <title>Did Islam Change? Or Did the Muslims Change?: Book VII: The Meaning of Punishment in Islam and Book VIII - Ghani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Punishment in Islam &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Blasphemy in Islam&lt;/em&gt; are the fifth and sixth installments of a projected series titled &lt;em&gt;Did Islam Change? Or Did the Muslims Change? &lt;/em&gt;The books were written by Ghani, an American Muslim who has lived with his family in Pakistan for over thirty years to learn about Islam and his cultural roots. The series, which took more than ten years to write, explains the tenets of Islam through the words of the Qur&amp;rsquo;an.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Punishment in Islam&lt;/em&gt;, Ghani explains that Islam teaches the importance of forgiveness towards those who err or do wrong. The purpose of &amp;ldquo;punishment&amp;rdquo; in Islam is not to bring pain or disgrace to a wrongdoer but to reform the wrongdoer and help him be a valuable part of society. Using the words of the Qur&amp;rsquo;an itself, he explains in the second part of the work, &lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Blasphemy in Islam &lt;/em&gt;that, in realty, there is no thing as &amp;quot;blasphemy&amp;quot; in Islam, nor does Islam prescribe a punishment for it. The Qur&amp;rsquo;an teaches that one man&amp;rsquo;s beliefs can be blasphemy to another. The Qur&amp;rsquo;an also teaches that the prophets of God, including Muhammad, faced overwhelming mockery and irreverence from their detractors, but responded with peace and patience and put their trust in God alone. Ghani believes that when men read the Qur&amp;rsquo;an with care and deliberation, a resurgence of the Muslim World can ensue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen centuries ago, Islam was revealed for the spiritual and material benefit of mankind. The teachings of the Prophet transformed the backward and pitiable Arab peoples into examples for the world to follow. For almost five centuries, Muslim scholars contributed much to the medieval world in terms of wisdom, science, and technology. They taught Europeans about algebra and optics, astronomy and chemistry, and even introduced ice cream. The light of erudition in Muslim books and instruments helped take Europe out of its long and difficult Dark Age and into the Renaissance. But, ironically, much of the Muslim world today is populated by the most backward and troubled peoples on the planet. The Qur&amp;rsquo;an is exactly the same today as it was when it was revealed to Muhammad over 1,400 years ago. The &lt;em&gt;Azan,&lt;/em&gt; or Muslim call to prayer, is spoken exactly the same today as it was during the time of Averroes, as are the words of the Muslim prayer itself. The Muslim fast of Ramadan is exactly the same today as it was centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that Muslims today must ask a vital question: &lt;em&gt;Did Islam change? Or did the Muslims change?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that this series, which is based on the writer&amp;rsquo;s experiences in both America and Pakistan can help readers find some solutions to the various and complex issues we see in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
