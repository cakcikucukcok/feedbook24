      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you could get all your work done by 6:00 p.m.? Eat dinner with your family every night? Form deep, satisfying relationships? Naturally blend the world of church with your everyday life? Spend hours a week on your hobbies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can!&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Making Room for Life&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reveals how to make all of these things a reality. Not by working faster or having more gadgets, but by simply choosing a lifestyle of conversation, and community over accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Frazee&#39;s practical, motivating insights call you back to the kind of relationships and life rhythms you were created to enjoy. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Making Room for Life&lt;/em&gt;, Frazee shows you how and why it&#39;s so important to balance work and play, establish healthy boundaries, deal with children&#39;s activities and homework, bring Jesus to your neighbors, and build authentic bonds with a circle of close friends. Share these insights with those around you and help usher in an amazing transformation: your life and the lives of others blooming, in the midst of the chaos and fragmentation of today&#39;s culture, into communities of purpose and peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
