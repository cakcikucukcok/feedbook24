When she realizes she has survived a head-on collisionand her father has nother world comes crashing down around her and shakes the foundation of her faith in God. 
When Carilyns best friends, Maxwell and Christina, step in to lift her spirits, Carilyn has no idea that Max has a crush on her. After she unconsciously begins to make Max the center of her life, she discovers he has fallen for the school shrew, Angela Hartford. Devastated by Maxs rejection and confused by her own feelings, Carilyn is on the verge of giving up on their friendship. Meanwhile, Christi risks her own relationship with Carilyn by suggesting she find her way back to God and, in her spare time, manages to instigate a big shake-up in the high school food chain.
When events begin to unfold around the anniversary of her fathers death that will change lives and finally push someone over the edge, Carilyn begins doubting the concept of faith, friendship, and even love. Only time will tell if she will indeed find the brightest light." />
