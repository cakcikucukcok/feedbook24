  <title>Volume One Ladies of Gold - James Maloney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ladies of Gold: The Remarkable Ministry of the Golden Candlestick begins a three-volume compilation of the visionary teachings of Frances Metcalfe and the members of the Golden Candlestick, a Christian fellowship of individuals who lived in a California mountain community a little more than seven decades ago. They focused their spiritual lives on worshiping God and in making intercessory prayers for the nations. Touched by the vitality of the visions experienced by these remarkable ladies, James Maloney has undertaken the work to prepare this collection of their direct experiences of the presence of God and His messages for the world.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an extended introductory essay, Who Were the Golden Candlestick?, James Maloney answers that titles question and places the groups ministry in context. The main body of Ladies of Gold presents eleven visions Frances Metcalfe described as records of her times of rapture.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you share the concern of the Golden Candlestick and James Maloney for experiencing true worship of the Lord and for praying for the wellbeing of the nations or if you have an interest in exploring the history of religious experience in twentieth-century American culture, then Ladies of Gold: The Remarkable Ministry of the Golden Candlestick will give you substantial food for thought and inspiration for reflection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
