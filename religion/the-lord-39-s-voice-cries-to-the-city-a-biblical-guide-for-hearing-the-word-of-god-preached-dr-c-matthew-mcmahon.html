  <title>The Lord&#39;s Voice Cries to the City: A Biblical Guide for Hearing the Word of God Preached - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about hearing the Word of God preached boldly, plainly and faithfully. It is particularly aimed at the Christian sitting in the pew who is required by God to hear the Word of God preached with spiritual profit to their soul. However, many pastors today would also do well to hear the contents of these chapters since their performance allows, or not, the ability for the Christian to accomplish the intended ends when they hear the Word preached. If they are negligent in preaching, the hearer can never do his commanded duty. It is primarily directed at the Christian hearer, though much will be said about the minister and his pulpit ability. It is directed at what Christians ought to expect when the minister stands up to preach in the pulpit. If the minister is not fulfilling his office as it should be intended, what is the final result? What should the congregation see, hear and expect in this regard, biblically speaking?" />
