  <title>The God Solution - Ian Stott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ian Stott was born in Moseley, Birmingham, in 1946 and became a travelling evangelist in 1986, with his Gospel band After the Fall, performing in prisons, remand homes, pubs, clubs, church halls, carnivals, fetes, festivals, handicapped homes and colleges all around the United Kingdom. After writing Touching Glory as the title song for the 1994 Cross Rhythms Festival in Devon, Ian and the band received a record distribution deal with Kingsway Music. He wrote the songs for two more albums, and the band continued its evangelistic work for eleven years. Ian has studied Bible Prophecy for thirty years and is now a full-time musician, working as a tribute act in the UK and worldwide. He has had songs and poems published during this period. After the Fall, the band, played their last show in 1997 on stage at Dudley Castle, Birmingham, live on Sky TV.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Stott is a layman, representing every man and brings a refreshing perspective to apologetics, with a dash of humour. He has a desire to reach people who know nothing about the Bible or what it contains. This book is a direct reply to militant atheism and The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. Atheism is growing and making much noise and needs a Christian answer. The author brings everything together in one place with amazing clarity and startling revelation  the evidence for God, the weakness of the argument for atheism and evolution, secret societies, Bible prophecy and the deception, misinformation and corruption of the shadow governments and leading players of this world. The world needs information that is intelligible to the man in the street, who only ever hears one side of the argument. The God Solution contains that information.&lt;p&gt;" />
