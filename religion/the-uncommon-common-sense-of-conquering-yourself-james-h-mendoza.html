  <title>The Uncommon Common Sense of Conquering Yourself - James H. Mendoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we get irritated, mad, emotional, resentful, furious, upset, hateful, etc., the adrenaline, norepinephrine, and dopaminepowerful hormones that are part of the human bodyacute stress response system are secreted into the bloodstream. They affect our body by stimulating the heart rate, shrinking blood vessels, and expanding our trachea and bronchia, inflating and deflating our lungs during high stress or exciting circumstances, all of which work to upsurge blood flow to the muscles and oxygen to the lungs. When these hormones are forwarded into the bloodstream from the adrenal glands located on top of the kidneys (about three inches or 7.6 cm in length), at least one of the electrons from the atoms that form the cells of every organ of our body is replaced by one electron of these hormones, amplifying our energy and turning it more capable of executing (in a microsecond) reactions not commonly done under normal conditions. These natural self-doping boosters are reserved for the defense department. These reactions may cause us to run faster, jump higher, scream louder, or take higher risks, putting our life or the life of others in danger by acting irrationally, having incontrollable body reactions designed to defend ourselves as part of our defense mechanism system. 
The ideal response to our problems is to deal with them with objectivity without any emotional attachments to them in that way to avoid all the reactions that cause illnesses and complications to ourselves." />
