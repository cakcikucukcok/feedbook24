  <title>Biblical Literacy: The Most Important People, Events, and Ideas of the Hebrew Bible - Joseph Telushkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As he did so brilliantly in his bestselling book, jewish literacy,Joseph Teluslikin once again mines a subject of, Jewish history and religion so richly that his book becomes an inspiring companion and a fundamental reference.
