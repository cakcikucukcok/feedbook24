  <title>The Reader-Friendly Life of Christ - Sterling H. Redd, Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By use of a singular and seamless format, and organized into thirteen chapters of pure Scripture, The Reader-Friendly Life of Christ takes the complexity out of a readers attempt to get a clear, basic, yet thorough overview of Christs mortal life and teachings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Christs major sermons, miracles, and parables are also identified and placed at a readers fingertips by use of an accompanying appendix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you finish reading this story, you may want to keep it close by for ready reference, and to experience again and again the simple, beautiful and powerful story of him who is worshipped by and inspires hundreds of millions.  
This is a complete, interwoven story not found in either one of Matthew, Mark, Luke, or Johns New Testament accounts alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though purely Biblical, even a child can understand this books marvelous message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read &lt;i&gt;(The Reader-Friendly Life of Christ)A Singular and Interwoven Biblical Account&lt;/i&gt;  which was compiled by Sterling H. Redd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that this compilation of the four gospels  of the New Testament  has profoundly clarified and made extremely accessible and readable the mortal ministry of the Savior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in a format that would enable children from about ten years of age and older to read the Scriptures as they are written with increased understanding and appreciation. &lt;br&gt;
