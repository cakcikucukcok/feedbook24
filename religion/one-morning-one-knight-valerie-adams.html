  <title>One Morning, One Knight - Valerie Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intimacy is what two people share without reservations. Talking to God is experiencing intimacy like no other. Its also like talking to man, you are sure to get an answer. It may not be the answer you want, but God is always speaking if youre listening. In every relationship, there are good times and bad times. Remember marriage vows prepare you just in case it gets rough, not that it will. 
The key to every great relationship is intimate communication. When you are intimate you are real. you are true. Going into any relationship with the right motives and intentions is the foundation of true friendships and love that will last a lifetime.
&quot;This book addresses the many complexities of the waiting game, the trusting game, and the journey of self and relationship with God. The &quot;voice&quot; of the story is very personable and real.&quot;
