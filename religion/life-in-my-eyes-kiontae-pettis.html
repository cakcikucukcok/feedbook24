This book was created from a sign from God as the author prayed for guidance. He wanted to know how many pages the book should be. He went to the bank, took out 200 dollars for a bill, and on a 20 dollar bill was a sign 500. This is how many poems there are within the book, and twenty represented the age it would get published. This book is very powerful. The imagery is explicit and the rhythm flows. There is great love of poetry. Really good sayings and situations explained the book have a certain format. It can have love poetry mixed with serious poetry, but the middle to end is thrilling. You will see a spiritual side of the author, as there are stories with God throughout the book.
