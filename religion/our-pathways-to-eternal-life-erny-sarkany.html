  <title>Our Pathways to Eternal Life - Erny Sarkany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you know that you can rewrite your life right now? Yes you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes you by the hand from where you are to where you should be. It is not just a fantasy but a proven path that God can use to give us the lift we so greatly desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can turn your life around with the information that you find in this book which is packed with nuggets of information that will help you to live the life of your dreams both now and for eternity. You can open your world to deep mysteries that give answers to long standing issues of your life. Never forget that each encounter with destiny comes along for a reason that will both aid and comfort you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first series on Preparing for Eternal Life, Our Pathways to Eternal Life is not just an answer to the questions you have in your life, especially when caring for your loved one, clients, friends or others who are experiencing suffering or end of life issues. It can also be applied to a vast array of issues and situations such as your marriage, your life, your finances, your family, your relationships, and other challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This journey will bring out the genius that makes all of us special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is based on the insight and experiences of the Author and has its roots in the Word of God. It comes to terms with the realities that one faces and offers options for a way out of each predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Pathways to Eternal Life is an excellent road map to begin this process. (Pastor Adam Bernal, Jubilee Christian Center, San Jose)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Pathways to Eternal Life can bring help when struggling with end of life issues. (Pastor John Headley, GateWay City Church, San Jose)&lt;/p&gt;" />
