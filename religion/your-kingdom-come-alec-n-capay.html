  <title>Your Kingdom Come - Alec N. Capay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, you will discover Gods will and purpose in bringing heaven to earth. For too long, we have desired and yearned to leave earth, along with all its problems and complications, without ever longing to see Gods kingdom and will established on earth. Jesus prayed, &quot;Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&quot; This was not necessarily the model prayer, but what we should literally be praying. We must pray that His kingdom comes to invade the earth and our lives. We must pray that His will be done.
The author explains and answers several key questions pertaining to the Kingdom of God, such as: what is Gods Kingdom? Is Gods Kingdom here and now? What is my role in this Kingdom? And so on. Alec unveils hidden truths from Scripture and challenges modern day theology concerning Gods Kingdom. As you open its pages, you will begin to understand and experience a different meaning of our mandate and responsibility as children and citizens of God. Come along as we discover the power, majesty, and beauty of Gods Kingdom that will revolutionize your life and ministry." />
