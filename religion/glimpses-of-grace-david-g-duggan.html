  <title>Glimpses of Grace - David G. Duggan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early forties, I began writing a regular column for the newspaper sent to Episcopalians in the diocese of Chicago. In Faithwalk, I tried to describe my struggles as a believing Christian set against my background as a lawyer, single parent, son of aging parents, and sinner. This venture in self-analysis continued a process of trying to square my life with Gods call to a Christian begun many years earlier, but the writing was, I believe, an insight into how God works in all lives. Though written from a Christian perspective, these essays should appeal to anyone struggling with his or her faith in a world that seems spinning out of control. And I believe that God uses nonbelievers as a fulcrum to test our own belief.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in my early sixties, after the columns collected dust, I reread them, and I think they stand the test of time. So, I have decided to publish them in a book, adding a bit of commentary to provide the context. They have been arranged, not in the order they were written, but rather according to topic, topics suggested by the biblical narrative by which the Creator of the universe loved us so much that he sent his only Son to die for us. I hope you enjoy them.&lt;p&gt;" />
