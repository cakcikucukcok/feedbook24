      <meta name="description" content="&quot;You have just stepped into life&quot; those were the prophetic words spoken to the author by her new  husbands non-Christian friend.  She would later discover how accurate those words were.    If you are wondering if you are called to the life of a missionary; gain insight from the adventures of two  travelers who started their lifelong journeys together in military life, the authors husband being a U.S. Navy pilot at that time.    Follow the continuing escapades of the author as the wife of a commercial Airline pilot, later becoming  church planters and eventually entering the mission field.    These many encounters are not only about the life of the author and her husband. The recollections also include some of the authors family and tales about many friendships forged along the way.    Stories that include very special friends who are much admired and respected by the author and her husband.   Two thirds of God&#39;s name is GO; If you are called to GO, the author guarantees you will never be bored." />
