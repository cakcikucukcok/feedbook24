  <title>The Meaning is in the Waiting: The Spirit of Advent - Paula Gooder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first in a series of books commissioned in consultation with John Sentamu. It can be described as &quot;The Archbishop of York&#39;s Advent book&quot;. Its theme is overtly an Advent one, yet subsequent books will range over other biblical and seasonal topics.Paula Gooder provides a profoundly biblical guide to the season of Advent and we explore its central theme of waiting (something we are not good at in our modern culture) in the company of the biblical characters who feature prominently in the lectionary readings for the season: Abraham and Sarah who waited for a child, Isaiah and the prophets who waited for judgement and redemption, John the Baptist whose role was to wait in the wilderness until the prophecies he foretold were realised, Mary whose waiting began in pregnancy and continued as she stood at the foot of the cross. Arranged for daily reading, this offers an exquisite meditation on the spirituality of waiting - the active doing of nothing - as a way of enhancing our lives and bringing us closer to God." />
