  <title>Sinners Have a Soul Too - R Smart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People live at least two lives; the one in front of the family and the one outside of that.  Now I can say that my more dominant personality is the only life. As a professional, it makes me feel good to know that people look upon me as someone competent, and possessing leadership qualities. Earning the Bachelors and Masters degrees have provided a different level of confidence; however, my development is attributed to a major portion of life in which I call the human services era or the stripping and male prostitution era.  
	For the past 6 years, teaching and training have been at the forefront. Why tell this story now?  Am I worried about what people think? People always compliment the man that I am, so it is necessary to know that mistakes made me into this man.  There is not a day that goes by that my thoughts dont rewind to the days of easy money, and frequent sexual encounters. Every time I open a check or check my bank account, my mind takes me to a place where there was no working 8 hours a day to earn minimal money or money being taken from the check to pay taxes. Going back is not an option because of a life fulfilled now.  I touch people now, but differently: with my words." />
