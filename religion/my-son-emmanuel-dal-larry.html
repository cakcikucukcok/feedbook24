  <title>My Son Emmanuel - Dal Larry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a boy, being reared in a highly religious atmosphere, the idea of a man living on earth two thousand years ago going about doing good, giving sight to the blind, healing the sick, and, eventually, dying for our sins was indeed perplexing in light of the fact that there was no living being to whom I could relate to Jesus Christ. This confusing phenomenon became more chaotic in my mind as I grew older and realized that individuals who claimed to be Jesuss prophets were seemingly His oppositedriving luxury cars, preaching against welfare handouts, condemning rather than forgiving those who found themselves taking the wrong path. &lt;p&gt;
If Jesus lived today, I meagerly reasoned, would He drive luxury cars? Would He own several Rolls Royces? Would He condemn those who did not contribute money to the cause of the kingdom? Would He go on television and radio condemning abortion? What would a present-day Jesus really be like? &lt;p&gt;
Over a period of many years, I jotted down thoughts, taped ideas, took notes of sermons, and studied the Gospels hoping to someday coordinate all of these into a novel depicting a present-day Jesus Christ. The present book is the result of that.&lt;p&gt;" />
