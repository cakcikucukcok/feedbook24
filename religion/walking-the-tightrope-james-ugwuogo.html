  <title>Walking the Tightrope - James Ugwuogo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For we are Gods handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do&lt;/em&gt;  Ephesians 2:10. This presupposes that we were not saved just because we did something good, special, or amazing; on the contrary, after we have been saved we are then called to do good works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in every work we do in life, we need some training. We are first taught what is expected of us and sometimes supervised (rebuked and correctedif that is what it takes) until we got the job done. Then, after passing through the learning curves, we are expected to show some competency and sometimes required to train others (2 Timothy 2:2).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;2 Timothy 3:16 outlines the purpose of the Scriptures, which is teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training till we attain verse 17 status: thoroughly equipped. God does not want us to be ill-equipped, rather to be completely and thoroughly equipped for every (not just some, but every) good work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
teaches us what we ought to know
shows us sins, blind spots, or errors to avoid
helps us make it right again and
helps us stay our course 
&lt;p&gt;If there is any blessing or laurel or glory as a result of this book, therefore, let the glory be to God and not to men.&lt;/p&gt;" />
