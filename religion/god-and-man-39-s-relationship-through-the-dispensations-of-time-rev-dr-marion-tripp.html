  <title>God and Man&#39;s Relationship Through the Dispensations of Time - Rev. Dr. Marion Tripp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God and Mans Relationship Through the Dispensations of Time
            This book is a follow up of What Was God Doing before He Made Man, Dr. Tripps unusual book. Gods plan for man through the ages is a progressive one, through seven dispensations of time. Ephesians 1:10, That in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.
            Through the ages, God has dealt with man in varied ways according to the period of time. These periods are known as dispensations. The prehistoric period does not come under a dispensation because there was no man during that period.
            A dispensation is a period of time when man is tested in respect to obedience to some specific revelation of the will of God for that period. There are seven such dispensations, each of which has a character of its own and is so distinct that it cannot be commingled with any other." />
