  <title>Science of All the Sciences - Dr. Mohammad Taqi Jamani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, I have tried to convince people that the Quran is the most authentic testimony of God or nature or, in the language of Albert Einstein, the testimony from the superior reasoning power. And in this regard, I have proven that the revelations in the Quran contain deep scientific insights as each verse includes all minute scientific details that were later uncovered by scientists. I have elaborated that if scientific knowledge is contradictory to the views of the Quran, its not at all because of faulty and premature declarations in the Quran. Rather, the opposite may be true as science is dependent on tools and techniques designed by humans frail and feeble minds, and many of the scientific advices and recommendations that were once valid are now obsolete as you can see in drugs of pharmacological origin, the utilization of cosmetics that were once recommended and now declared as harmful, and lots of other examples.
In accomplishing this task, I have supported my views on the basis of my own observations of natural phenomena, deep studies on the subjects, and the products of meticulous thinking. My book can benefit people in two ways. First, it can consolidate the faith of those who believe in the Quran and God. Second, it can convince nonbelievers to consider the Quran as a scientifically reasonable book revealed onto the heart of the prophet solely and exclusively by the supreme authority who claims responsibility of governance of all the phenomena on earth and the heavens.
Another interesting area in this book deals with the physical health benefits embedded in the rituals and practices of Islam, told in a convincing tone so that it can draw our attention toward the practical aspects of religion. This you can see in chapters on breastfeeding, the use of honey as a medicine, and in the chapter Recommendations of Islamic Sharia: Health Benefits." />
