  <title>Enter the Holy Spirit, Exit Me - Virginia S. Saunders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enter the Holy Spirit, Exit Me was the result of quickened words from the Holy Spirit on January 5, 2012, when Ms. Saunders was reading Psalm 96:3, which told her to Tell His glory among the nations. Among all peoples His wondrous deeds! As a successful and established writer in Asia, she has not written anything of value for twelve years, ever since her husband died in June 2000. His passing created in her a writers block that was excruciatingly painful and fearful. But when she heeded the prompting, the Holy Spirit immediately lifted her writers block, inspiring her to write about the supernatural actions and gifts she has been experiencing since 1993 after attending a charismatic seminar and receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit. These gifts included praying tongues, healing hands, prophecies and visions. Be inspired. The supernatural gifts are for everyone. Ms. Saunders tells you how to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
