  <title>Revelation and the Mark of the Beast - Z. Richard Sawan M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No longer do I want you to be afraid of Revelation as I was but rather embrace the inevitable future that God has planned for us. This book is a passport to the future of humanity and will explain the end-times in simple ways, for the most part, based on Biblical interpretation and not on widely accepted views or mine. Most of the prevalent views on Revelation that you have learnt or learning are incorrect. Not knowing the future with respect to God&#39;s plan could jeopardize the timing of your salvation which could put one in the receiving end of God&#39;s plagues.
Revelation was written for us today in the end-times and not for the Jews and ancient Romans 2000 years ago. This book will prove this to be true beyond a shadow of a doubt. Revelation cannot be interpreted without key scriptures in books in the Old Testament thus proving that there is divine intervention in the Bible as a whole. It is impossible for different human authors to write so many different books with hundreds to thousands of years in between and have the same conclusions and interpretations. IMPOSSIBLE.
We are presently near the end of the Great Tribulation with the Day of our Lord fast approaching. Already five of the seven seals have been opened with the sixth approaching rapidly. The beast of Revelation chapter 13 is alive and well and the mark of the beast is already in use. A limited nuclear war is on the horizon and world domination by the Son of Satan by means of a 200 million-man army would follow. 
There is good news though. Read this book." />
