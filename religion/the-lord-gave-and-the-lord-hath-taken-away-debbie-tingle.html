  <title>The Lord Gave, and the Lord Hath Taken Away - Debbie Tingle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a reflection of my own life. Very early in life I suffered many losses. I asked myself many times why me? Through the years, as I got older I better understood. I got saved and baptized and learned that one day we would meet again. My bible became my study guide through life. I owe all this to my husband and best friend combined. As you read through the book you will wonder how someone could live through this, but if you read the bible verses as you go you will come to understand how someone can still go on living." />
