  <title>Worthy to Escape - Marlon L. Sias, Adrian Zenz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christians base their understanding of the end times on the popular pretribulation rapture view. They expect that Jesus will rescue them just-in-time before the tribulations of the Antichrist. However, few people realize that every single biblical promise of being raptured at that time is conditional on personal spiritual readiness. Eminent Christian leaders such as A.B. Simpson, founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, as well as Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission, first taught this biblical perspective of a conditional rapture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their captivating account, the authors take their readers on a fascinating journey through the pages of the Bible, showing how biblical prophecies from Daniel to Revelation point toward not just one but two raptures: a conditional first fruits rapture for the ready wise virgins of the church, and a later rapture for foolish virgin believers who are spiritually unprepared. Packed with fresh scriptural insights, this book will prepare and equip you for the times ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worthy to Escape makes for a thoroughly intriguing read! It is rare for Christians to apply the Hebraic traditions regarding marriage to the rapture. That and the books strong focus on spiritual intimacy set it apart from the majority of end times writings.&lt;br /&gt; Messianic Rabbi Ed Rothman, Hon. M. Div., Hon. Dr. M.S. &amp; J.C.,&lt;br /&gt;Seed of Abraham Messianic Congregation, St. Louis Park, MN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should become familiar with the first fruits rapture. I highly recommend this book!&lt;br /&gt; Rev. J. McCracken, Team Leader, TrueBridge Family of Churches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any student of eschatology needs to read this book and consider its insights. Bible colleges and seminaries should use it as a reference work and make it required reading.&lt;br /&gt; Pastor T. Porta, Grace Gospel Church, Cambridge, MN&lt;/p&gt;" />
