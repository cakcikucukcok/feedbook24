  <title>The Tricks and Snares of the Devil - Horace Dellafosse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The inspiration to write this book was planted in my heart by the Holy Spirit over twenty years ago. I started writing chapter by chapter as the spirit inspired me.  The title of each chapter was give to me by the Holy Spirit. At times I couldnt write a single word and at other times the words wouldnt stop. I was awaken sometimes in the early morning hours and midnight at times. The very title of this book was given to me a visual view. I was looking up while sitting in a warehouse when I notice that there were spider webs in the corner with an insect trapped in its web. The Holy Spirit said that mankind also is trapped in Satans web of sins. I notice that a spider was across the room in the far corner slowly making his way back to his web where upon his arrival he consumed the insect. The Holy Spirit then said that man get him or herself trapped then it may take a while for the old Devil to shows up to destroy them. 
Each Chapter deals with problems or demonic addictions which many in this world are dealing with. My hope is that this book will open up the eyes of ever one knowing that we all need Gods salvation and deliverance.  There a many Christians walking around saved but not delivered from Generational curses and sins of their fathers and ancestors.
Please understand that upon reading this book one need to eat whats for them and leave the rest for the others who needs the rest. 
Some readers may not be Christians or born again members of the body of Christ and may have Questions. Go to the word of God (the bible) verify scriptures and ask you pastors. We all have been commanded to study to show ourselves approved unto God." />
