  <title>The Plans of Our Enemy Have Been Revealed - Stephen Haastrup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are in a battlefield; it doesnt matter if you are born again or not. As long as Satan exists, there will always be a struggle for the souls of mankind to be lost. Satan is trying very hard to hide himself, his demons, and his tactics from the saints of God and also from the world. Please be aware that this is not a study of demonology or another book that concentrates on demons. This is a book that helps you to realize some aspect of your work with God, first as a believer, minister, pastor, bishop, and worker in the household of God. As time goes on, we shall see the areas that the devil is making sure we do not pay close attention to. We shall be looking closely at the tactics of the enemy and also the tactics that God wants us to use in fighting against wicked spirits, principalities of powers, and all other things that fight against righteousness. This book also looks into leadership, money, debt, and relationships. These are areas that the devil is attacking." />
