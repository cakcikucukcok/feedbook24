  <title>Bible Folks - Ernest D. Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some of my favorite Bible stories have been about Noah, David and Goliath, Elijah, and many stories about Jesus. All of these are included in Bible Folks.
In these stories, youll feel the jealousy of Cain, hear the jibes and taunts of Noahs neighbors as he labors on the ark, hurry with Lot and his family through the streets of Sodom to escape the impending death promised by the angels of God. Youll listen in on the conversations and hear the private thoughts of the folks in the Bible.
In some of these stories I have given names to individuals who weren&#39;t mentioned by name in the Bible. I have also suggested possible answers that someone might ask about.  Some of these include Where did Cain find a wife? How did God let Cain know his offering was rejected?  and How did Noah find the animals and get them aboard the ark?
These stories are written from an adult perspective and deal with adult themes, such as homosexuality, incest (The Birth of Two Nations), and adultery (David and Bathsheba). In two stories of sinner women, they were cast in the role of prostitutes (whether they were or not is not fully explained in the Bible). I suggest that you read these stories yourself before reading them to your children.
God Bless you for your interest in Gods Word." />
