  <title>You Make Me Brave - Bethany Lesch Grubb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesuss view of women was radical. So why does it seem like the Church does not view women the same way? Why, in so many parts of the world (including America) are women not encouraged towards their full potential as leaders in the church? Are you living with a very palpable tension between your roles of wife, mother, and career woman? You are not alone. The secular world attempts to embrace women as equals. We are equals in many ways, but we are not exactly the same. I believe as women, we are uniquely created for such a time as this. Let us lay aside the damaging judgements that we bring against each other (working or not, divorced or not, single, childless, many children, black, brown, yellow or white) and let us unite. Let us come to the table and have conversations about the strong, vibrant, thriving place the Lord has designed women to live in. We are His ezer warriors. May we be humble as we allow space for this new kind of conversation. May we step boldly into the conversation and even more so as we are propelled into battle. I see you warrior woman.&lt;/p&gt;" />
