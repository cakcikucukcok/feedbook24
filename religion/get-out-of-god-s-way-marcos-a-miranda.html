  <title>Get out of God’S Way - Marcos A. Miranda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We can become so constricted by liturgical rituals that we cannot love God in our own way. When we cannot live up to the impossible standards that have been placed on us by some denomination or faith group, we may start to feel bad about ourselves, and that only takes us farther and farther away from God. When we come to church to meet with like-minded individuals in search of spiritual reinforcement or support, human rules and regulations grafted on to religion often make us feel belittled, as if we are doing everything wrong. Rather than finding absolution from our sins, we are made to feel inadequate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message of Jesus Christ is a message of hope and love for all people. Scripture is beautifully written, and when we delve into it deeply, when we uncover its mysteries, that leads to enlightenment. As Christians, we are called on to imitate Christ. That is why it is so important that we closely study the words and actions of Jesus Christeverything He did, every move He made, everything He said, and how He delivered it. Jesus only rarely became angry, but He was never hateful. That is Gods way. We will never be Christ, but we should try to imitate Him as closely as possible. However, when it comes to spirituality, we are our own worst enemies, constantly getting in Gods way. What we need to do more than anything else is to get out of Gods way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
