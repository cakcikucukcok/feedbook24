  <title>Foundations - Dr. James Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FOUNDATIONS takes an in depth approach to the design and function of ministry and discipleship. We find in the modern Church a great need for discipleship and spiritual training. Many believers, who &quot;know to do good,&quot; struggle in their daily spiritual life as they long for an expression of overcoming faith. FOUNDATIONS leads the reader into a meaningful recognition of their place in Christ. He is our righteousness and God&#39;s grace and goodness leads every saint into a repentant and firm faith. 
There are two kinds of &quot;knowledge&quot; spoken of in the Bible, which are information and application. Information is knowledge that &quot;puffs up&quot; (1 Corinthians 8:1), due to the potential it has to lure people into believing that the more information they have about the Bible, the more mature they are. Hosea speaks about the second type of knowledge when he wrote: &quot;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.&quot; He was expressing our need for the application of God&#39;s word that is necessary for the salvation of our souls and the impartation of Christ-likeness every Christ needs. The application of spiritual truth is the key to an overcoming faith and a renewed mind. Because of this, FOUNDATIONS offers a functional approach to Discipleship and spiritual training which develops the believer&#39;s ability to stand firm in the faith they profess. 
With this in mind; Solomon asked God for an understanding heart (i.e., &quot;a hearing heart&quot; - 1 Kings 3:9), because he understood that  in order for anyone to be inclined toward wisdom they had to first hear God. FOUNDATIONS is designed to help the believer mature in their faith by expanding their ability to renew their mind while they develop an understanding heart, so they can  learn to hear the Holy Spirit in a clarifying way. Every saint must mature in their ability to hear God as they read the Bible and listen to the Holy Spirit, and this is more readily accomplished through the discipleship process and through spiritual growth. FOUNDATIONS is an exegetical study that was compiled over twenty-eight years of pastoral and ministry experience. It is a study of the Scripture that dives deeply into the ways of God as it also expounds on many of the principles, practices, and doctrines found in the Scriptures. FOUNDATIONS is a practical tool for the serious disciple, and an aid for every Church leader." />
