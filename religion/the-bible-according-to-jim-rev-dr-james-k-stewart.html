  <title>The Bible According to Jim - Rev. Dr. James K. Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1976, Rev. Dr. Stewart read the whole Bible for the first time and became fascinated with Gods relationship with creation. After an early life in construction, Dr. Stewart felt Gods calling and returned to university. At university, he majored in ancient history and studied the Hebrew language. His exegetical work is taken directly from biblical Hebrew and Greek. This ability has helped him understand how ancient male bias has been promoted by the church in all ages. As a student of the Bible, he has come to see how the womens voice has often been suppressed. He has also come to appreciate that when it is not suppressed, a certain beauty shines forth. Knowledge of scripture, from the Hebrew perspective, allowed him to discover how the male voice can make a positive statement at the beginning of a story and then go on to contradict the statement by describing the negative actions that followed. Dr. Stewart lives in Milverton, Ontario, with his wife, Marjorie, of forty-five years; they enjoy visiting their two children and five grandchildren. Retirement has given him the opportunity to research, write, and play golf.
