  <title>Truth Be Told - Brandon McManus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Truth Be Told was birthed out of an encounter with a man who had lost it all because of a series of his own bad choices, but he was somehow clinging to one of Gods greatest promises in a way that made me feel that he expected God to bless him even though he continued to make poor choices. As I thought about the truth of that great promise that he wanted to pluck from its context, I realized that it is so easy to do. In fact, as I thought back over my years of ministry, I found that I too was guilty of misquoting verses and clinging to them in the wrong way just because I heard someone else do it. Too much of Christendom is groomed by poor theology and poor hermeneutical guidelines. This book will take some of the verses that have been misused and shine the light of proper interpretation upon them. You will see that encouragement and application from Gods eternal truth can come without the cost of compromising Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
