  <title>Toward a Meaningful Life - Simon Jacobson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toward a Meaningful Life &lt;/em&gt;is a spiritual road map for living based on the teachings of one of the foremost religious leaders of our time: Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Head of the Lubavitcher movement for forty-four years and recognized throughout the world simply as &amp;#8220;the Rebbe,&amp;#8221; Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who passed away in June 1994, was a sage and a visionary of the highest order.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toward a Meaningful Life &lt;/em&gt;gives people of all backgrounds&amp;#160; fresh perspectives on every aspect of their lives&amp;#8212;from birth to death, youth to old age; marriage, love, intimacy, and family; the persistent issues of career, health, pain, and suffering; and education, faith, science, and government. We learn to bridge the divisions between accelerated technology and decelerated morality, between unprecedented worldwide unity and unparalleled personal disunity. Although the Rebbe&amp;#8217;s teachings are firmly anchored in more than three thousand years of scholarship, the urgent relevance of these old-age truths to contemporary life has never been more manifest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; At the threshold of a new world where matter and spirit converge, the Rebbe proposes spiritual principles that unite people as opposed to the materialism that divides them. In doing so, he continues to lead us toward personal and universal redemption, toward a meaningful life, and toward God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
