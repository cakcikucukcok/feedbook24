  <title>The Master’S Voice – Hearing and Heeding God’S Will for Your Life! - Winston Abrams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is primarily about Gods voice, Gods direction, Gods guidance, Gods protection, and deciphering Gods will for your life in these last days where there are many voices competing for our attention.  There are those that teach God does not speak today.  Then there are those that teach God speaks in many ways and in everything; nature, audible voices, circumstances etc.  God spoke in the past, God speaks now, and God will be speaking for all eternity.  From the time God spoke the world into existence to now, He has never stopped speaking to and through His creation  and He will continue to speak throughout eternity.  The question is how does He speak today, and who is listening? This book shows, from Scriptures, how to know the voice of the true and living God in these last days of confusion and deception.  Our Lord warned us that the world would be characterized by deception in the last days according to 2nd Timothy 3:1,3; and also admonished that My sheep know my voice in John 10:27." />
