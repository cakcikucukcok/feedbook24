  <title>The Fountain of Life Opened Up: For a Display of Christ in His Essential and Medaitorial Glory - John Flavel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear friends, my heart&#39;s desire and prayer to God for you is that you may be saved. O that I knew how to engage this whole town to Jesus Christ, and make fast the marriage-knot betwixt him and you, albeit after that I should presently go to the place of silence; and see men no more, with the inhabitants of the world. Ah sirs! me thinks I see the Lord Jesus laying the merciful hand of a holy violence upon you:methinks he calls to you, as the angel to Lot saying, &quot;Arise, lest ye be consumed; And &quot;while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, the Lord being merciful unto him. And they brought him without the city, and said, Escape for thy life, stay not in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed,&quot; Gen. 19: 15. How often (to allude to this) has Jesus Christ in like manner laid hold upon you in the preaching of the gospel, and will you not flee for refuge to him  Will you rather be consumed, than to endeavour an escape" />
