  <title>When was Jesus Really Born? - David Hamshire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was Jesus born at Christmas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it true that God&amp;#39;s Word does not indicate the date of Christ&amp;#39;s birth? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;David Hamshire takes the reader on a journey of discovery to find that the date of Jesus&amp;#39; birth is revealed in Scripture from Creation to the Feasts of Israel. David Hamshire explores the Genesis account of the days of Creation, well-known verses of Scripture and the annual Feasts of Israel to establish a biblical basis for suggesting the Day of Atonement - one of the most important days in the Jewish calendar - as the correct day and date for Jesus&amp;#39; birth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was rebuked humbled and greatly encouraged by David in this book. Coming from a Sabbath fellowship I may not agree with all he says but I highly recommend it to all who seek to understand our saviour Yeshua and all who seek the light. How could I not have seen this before? Maybe because no-one told me as David says. Why did I not consider the importance and gravity of the Incarnation of Messiah? Thank you David for opening my eyes to so much more of the woven truths within the Scriptures. This is truly a must read for those seeking to understand YHWH&amp;#39;S WORD. It is revelation I have not read before and has been food for my soul, a new window into the Glory of YHWH ELOHIM. - &lt;em&gt;Dave (Amazon Customer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I found David&amp;#39;s book fascinating. It is clearly and concisely written and every argument is thoroughly backed up by scripture. I love the fact that everything God has done, and is going to do, is like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that need to be found in His Word and then fitted together to make the whole, and David has certainly placed many of the pieces together in his book. As a fairly newcomer to understanding more about the Jewish faith, I found the descriptions of the different festivals fascinating and am now excited to learn even more! - &lt;em&gt;WMC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;David Hamshire has given us a book that explores a question that has challenged the Church for centuries. &amp;ldquo;When was Jesus really born?&amp;rdquo; directly challenges traditional thinking and adds a biblical dimension, well thought through and scripturally supported throughout. If read with an open mind, it can only bring the reader to the point of making a decision relating to a very important subject. The argument is convincing, well presented and will undoubtedly cause a re-thinking for many.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to the main subject, I was personally &amp;nbsp;greatly blessed by the five points used to present the writer&amp;rsquo;s conviction. Each &amp;ldquo;Sign&amp;rdquo; is a complete study in itself. To have a copy of this inspiring book is to gain a five-book library of good, solid, biblical teaching. Any one of the five points is a book in itself, and I found myself wonderfully enlightened on great truths of the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whilst each reader will be challenged to a personal conviction to the conclusions of this excellent piece of work and research, I am convinced that this book should be read widely as a source of biblical information that is nothing short of a &amp;ldquo;Treasury of Teaching&amp;rdquo;. I would particularly recommend it to anyone who has a thirst for learning more of God. - &lt;em&gt;Dr Tony Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
