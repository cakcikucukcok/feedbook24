  <title>Warring  in the Spirit - Loretta Harrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prophetess Loretta Harrell is an ordained minister of In His Presence Cathedral of Praise, a church founded by Apostle Leonard E. Cohen located in the great city of Tallahassee, Florida. She gave her life to the Lord at the age of 18 years old and diligently sought the face of God for instruction and direction in His righteousness. It was evident that she was born to fight; it was through her own trials and tribulations that she began to see the mighty hand of God move on her behalf. Growing up in a dysfunctional home she learned at a very young age, that God will answer the sincere prayers of His beloved. &quot;Warring in the Spirit&quot; &quot;Preparing for Spiritual Battle&quot; was inspired by her life story and how she has fought to proclaim her inheritance. She is a peculiar woman that walks in a strange anointing that comes directly from God. As you read this book on spiritual warfare, your heart and mind will engage in a realm that has been closed to so many; for so long. You will be enlightened and empowered by the revelation that will come forth from the word of God and from the spirit of a warrior who has stood the test of time." />
