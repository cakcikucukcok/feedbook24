  <title>Keep On Standing: The Story of Krystaal - Darlene Polachic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 1989 student massacre in Lubumbashi, Zaire under the brutal rule of dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko was almost the end for brothers Michel, Fabian and Aliston Lwamba. Escaping with only their lives, that day was a grim and deadly reality marking the beginning of an incredible saga that changed their lives forever. During the chaos, the Lwambas were separated from each other, living in refugee camps for over five years and leaving many of their relatives for dead. They survived violence, disease, depression and starvation before they met God and found in Him both the reason and the will to keep on standing. Eventually Michel and Aliston were sponsored and given the opportunity to migrate to Canada, and later miraculously reunited with their brother Fabian, who was feared to have been killed. Today, the music that the brothers shared in the refugee camps that brought people purpose and healing, has led them to found the group Krystaal, whose award winning music style blends gospel, hip-hop, R&amp;B and African styles. In September 2006, they launched the &quot;Krystaal World Peace Tour,&quot; advocating peace -- politically, interpersonally and spiritually -- around the world. Their aim is to share with others the hope that music brought to them, particularly to children, who like themselves, have been orphaned by war. Keep On Standing - The Story of Krystaal is a true story of hope, faith and deliverance." />
