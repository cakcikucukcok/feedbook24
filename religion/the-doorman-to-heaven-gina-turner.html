  <title>The Doorman to Heaven - Gina Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People need a plumb line for Truth. People need evidence for the true history of spirituality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The crux of the matter is the cross. The resurrection is a reality. The heart of the matter is the condition of peoples heartsand we need to be aware of our standing with the Doorman. &lt;i&gt;The Doorman to Heaven&lt;/i&gt; sends readers an invitation to the Banquet, emphasizing the importance of responding. A relationship quiz examines the readers standing with the Doorman, and gives a description of the alternative to accepting the Doormans offer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Through &lt;i&gt;The Doorman to Heaven,&lt;/i&gt; we see a glimpse of the Doorman through His Book and discover His ways as explained therein. What is His Presence like? &lt;i&gt;The Doorman to Heaven&lt;/i&gt; gives a comforting description of where our loved ones who have joined His family spend their time after leaving this earth.  Share it with friends and relatives whose eternal standing hasnt been clearly decided, and those struggling with everyday realities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following is taken from the Appendix of &lt;i&gt;The Doorman to Heaven:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Bible says in Romans 10:9, &lt;i&gt;&quot;If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1.	Admit you are a sinner. &lt;br&gt;
2.	Be willing to turn from sin (repent). &lt;br&gt;
3.	Believe that Jesus Christ died for you, was buried and rose from the dead. &lt;br&gt;
4.	Through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal Savior. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dear God, I am a sinner and need forgiveness. I believe that Jesus Christ shed His precious blood and died for my sin. I am willing to turn from sin. I now invite Christ to come into my heart and life as my personal Savior.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If youve accepted Jesus Christ as your own personal Savior, then you will want to do the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1.	Read your Bible every day to get to know Christ better. &lt;br&gt;
2.	Talk to God in prayer every day. &lt;br&gt;
3.	Be baptized, worship, fellowship, and serve with other Christians where Christ is preached and the Bible is the final authority. &lt;br&gt;
4.	Tell others about Christ. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
