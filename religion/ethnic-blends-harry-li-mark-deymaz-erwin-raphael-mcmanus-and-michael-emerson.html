  <title>Ethnic Blends - Harry Li, Mark DeYmaz, Erwin Raphael McManus and Michael Emerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this Ethnic Blends Ebook, multi-ethnic church pioneer Mark DeYmaz provides an up-close and personal look at seven common challenges to mixing diversity into your local church. Through real-life stories and practical illustrations, DeYmaz shows how to overcome the obstacles in order to build a healthy multi-ethnic church. He also includes the insights of other effective, multi-ethnic local church pastors from around the country.Increasingly, church leaders are recognizing the intrinsic power and beauty of the multi-ethnic church. Yet, more than a good idea, it&#39;s a biblical, first-century standard with far-reaching evangelistic potential. How can your church overcome the obstacles in order to become a healthy, fruitful multi-ethnic church of faith? And why should you even try?“Ethnic Blends will help every church broaden its horizon of outreach, love and care for their city. Acts 1:8 commands us to reach the uttermost parts of the earth. Today, the &quot;uttermost parts&quot; are found within a few miles of where you live. God called us to reach people, love people and help them grow in Christ, no matter their background. Mark&#39;s book helps us recapture that vision in a powerful way.”  —Jonathan Falwell, pastor, Thomas Road Baptist Church" />
