  <title>The Harlot Demon Unveiled - Maxine Malcolm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Harlot Demon Unveiled is a stunning revelation of the harlot spirit, a principality of the forces of darkness; revealed as the death angel, the spirit of the great whore of Revelation 17,18, &amp; 19 &lt;br /&gt;
I believe I have been divinely chosen in this last hour to manifest and declare the name of the Sovereign Yahweh and his son Yahshua. To declare that Yahweh rules in all heaven and earth; that He still relates to mankind and whosoever will seek him with all their heart, He will reveal to them the mysteries of the gospel (an abundance of truth).&lt;br /&gt;
To reveal the hidden force and agenda of Satan the enemy of or souls, and the evil spirits that are influencing our loved ones to murder, commit suicide, and all types of hateful crimes against each other. The word of Yahweh warns us not to be ignorant of Satan&#39;s devices &quot;lest he get an advantage over us.&quot; (see, II Corinthians 2:11) Yahweh declares that His people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge. (see, Hosea 4:6) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Proverbs 7:24-27) Harken unto Me now therefore o ye children and attend to the words of my mouth. Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray on her paths. For she has cast down many wounded; Yea, many strong men have been slain by her. (The harlot demon) Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My earnest desire is that through the revelation of the Holy Scripture and the disclosure of some if my personal experiences the reader will be transformed by the wealth of knowledge and truth. Yahweh sent his word and healed them and delivered them from all their destructions. (see. Psalms 107:20)" />
