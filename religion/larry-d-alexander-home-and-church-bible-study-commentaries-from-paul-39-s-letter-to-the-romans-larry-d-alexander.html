  <title>Larry D. Alexander Home and Church Bible Study Commentaries from Paul&#39;s Letter to the Romans - Larry D. Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul&#39;s letter to the Romans is the most formal and systematic of his New Testament epistles. In fact, it has been called, and, is considered to be, the theological cornerstone of the New Testament. The main theme of this letter is that &quot;righteousness&quot; is a free gift from GOD, and is only receivable by &quot;faith&quot;. Paul wrote this letter to introduce himself to the Church at Rome, and to give them a summary of Christian teaching.  He begins by showing them how every person has rebelled against GOD, and is cut off from HIM because of sin. Paul also demonstrates in this letter how GOD, through HIS mercy, interceded, while we were yet set against HIM in full-fledged sin. GOD, then, opened the way back up to HIMSELF through CHRIST JESUS, and now, anyone who trusts in JESUS will be saved from evil, and be given the power of GOD, through the HOLY SPIRIT, to live a good life." />

    	<p>Paul's letter to the Romans is the most formal and systematic of his New Testament epistles. In fact, it has been called, and, is considered to be, the theological cornerstone of the New Testament. The main theme of this letter is that "righteousness" is a free gift from GOD, and is only receivable by "faith". Paul wrote this letter to introduce himself to the Church at Rome, and to give them a summary of Christian teaching. He begins by showing them how every person has rebelled against GOD, and is cut off from HIM because of sin. Paul also demonstrates in this letter how GOD, through HIS mercy, interceded, while we were yet set against HIM in full-fledged sin. GOD, then, opened the way back up to HIMSELF through CHRIST JESUS, and now, anyone who trusts in JESUS will be saved from evil, and be given the power of GOD, through the HOLY SPIRIT, to live a good life.</p>
