  <title>Parables of Salvation - David T Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The authors wife has frequently reminded him that there is a sermon in everything! The parables of Jesus demonstrate clearly to us that spiritual truths can be readily communicated with the aid of everyday objects.  Just as Jesus used real life situations such as sowing or lost coins, so the attempt is made here to draw spiritual lessons from objects met every day. The emphasis in this book is on familiar objects, such as will be met frequently in life. Thus while it is a good and valid technique to add visual material to a talk by means of a picture, a word or a series of letters, this is not done here.  The emphasis is on the object and the message gleaned from that, rather than on an attempt to visualize the message.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Those wanting inspiration for children&#39;s talks that will not bore them, or illustrations to liven up a sermon, will find a wealth of ideas here.  No time-consuming making of pictures and posters, but just the use of ordinary objects, found in every home.&lt;/P&gt;" />
