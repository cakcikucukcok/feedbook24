  <title>Under the Watchful Eye of Mary - Pamela Mandela Idenya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the Lord Jesus faced imminent death upon the Cross, He dedicated all His beloved disciples to a love relationship with His Mother saying, Behold your mother! St. John was present at the foot of the Cross, representing all mankind. And from that hour, he took her into his home. This commissioning of the Blessed Virgin Mary as Mother of all mankind illustrates the great love with which the LORD Jesus offered His life for all peoples - by giving us the gift of His mother. All are to comprehend that Mary has an active role to play in our faith and in our spiritual life. We acknowledge that this is how the LORD Jesus wished to bring His Sacrifice to completion by entrusting His mother to His beloved disciple, and in the beloved disciple to all mankind. It is a concrete maternal love relationship between Mary and all who trustingly commend themselves to her care. Under the watchful eye of Mary is a spiritual journey where we learn from the Blessed Mother of God what living a worthy discipleship in the LORD is, and we meditatively pray with the Blessed Mary as the first Christian Community did before Pentecost." />
