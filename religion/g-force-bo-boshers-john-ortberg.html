  <title>G-Force - Bo Boshers, John Ortberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Includes 55 personal devotions, 11 small group studies, and a leader’s guide!Ever feel tired of trying really hard to be a Christian? Being a Christ-follower isn’t about trying really hard; it’s about training to be more like Jesus so he can transform you into the person he made you to be. G-Force shows you how.The “Five Gs” of G-Force are markers or guides for your spiritual journey. They are designed to help take the guesswork out of what it really means to be a fully devoted follower of Christ—to live like Jesus would if he were in your place. In personal devotions and weekly small group gatherings you’ll learn about:Grace: Move beyond religious rules and regulations and learn how to live in God’s grace–then learn how to share this grace with others. Growth: Discover how spiritual practices can bring you closer to the heart of God.Groups: Experience an authentic community where you will learn what it means to know and be known—to have real and intimate friendships throughout your life.Gifts: Identify your spiritual gifts and dedicate them to serving God—then watch how God uses your gifts to impact the world in amazing ways.Good Stewardship: Trust God with all your resources and discover what it means to live with freedom and generosity.Each session you’ll be challenged to think about what you really believe and learn how to have a deeper relationship with God and with others. Once you discover the power of G-Force, you learn that ultimately, being a Christian is about Christ with you and within you, guiding and empowering you to become more like him. Attention Student Ministry Leaders!G-Force uses an innovative new approach that engages students both individually and in small groups: individually with daily devotions, guided journaling and creative experiences; and in small groups with a weekly Bible study and group activities. The result is two weeks of foundational training and powerful teaching that will equip students for a lifetime of full devotion to Christ." />
