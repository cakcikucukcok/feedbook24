  <title>The Mystical Keys to the Book of Revelation - Laura Lee Galan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mystical Keys to the Book of Revelation&lt;/i&gt; is about the author&#39;s miraculous transformation that was responsible for aligning her soul with the Spirit of the living God. As her journey progressed, God and his angels taught Laura the secrets to the Book of Revelation. They revealed that this sacred Scripture is not a book of doom and gloom, but simply describes in symbolic language the stages of metamorphosis that will occur on the planet as the souls of humanity are aligned with the divine spirit. Laura&#39;s own metamorphosis led her into the arms of true love as she and her soul mate were united. She reveals how the forces of the Holy Trinity become active in two souls as they become bonded by Divine Love. Laura has recorded her journey and the messages that the Divine Spirit imparted to her in the hopes that they will inspire others to search for truth and love in their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
