  <title>Modern Paladin - Victor Matthews PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An instant classic, Modern Paladin (a holy warrior for todays world) combines the best of Bible commentary and church-leader discipleship. This work is as comprehensive and detailed as any program for leadership development could be. It begins with the discovery that the ancient city of Ephesus is the only church location to receive both an epistle from Paul and a letter in Revelations. This city and church are proven to be perfect representatives of the modern church and a line-by-line analysis of Ephesians uncovers over a hundred bullet-point lessons for modern church leaders. This in-depth commentary then evolves into an actual system, the modern paladin system, wherein a reader can analyze themselves, their small groups, and even whole churches, with an eye toward the biblical lessons of leadership. Absolutely required reading for any church leader that wants to improve or any scholar or student that wants to know more about Ephesians or what the Bible has to say about leadership. Dive in and discover how you can strengthen yourself, your small groups, and your church, striving through the Word of God to become a modern paladin!&lt;/p&gt;" />
