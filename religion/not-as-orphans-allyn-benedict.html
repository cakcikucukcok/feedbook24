  <title>Not as Orphans - Allyn Benedict</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not As Orphans was life-changing for me. It charts the journey of a soul, my soul and your soul, from fearful orphan to precious child of the Father. The journey is best taken slowly, thoughtfully and prayerfully as there are many profound insights that need to be pondered and received in the deep places of the heart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Carolyn Hart&lt;/b&gt;, National Prayer and Ministry Co-ordinator, England&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; This remarkable book leads us into a closer walk with God. Christ is immediately real, present and alive. We feel His life-giving breath upon us. We sense His loving gaze penetrating our innermost being. This is a liberating encounter which enables us to discover our real humanity. Not As Orphans unlocks a secret place and brings us into an awesome closeness with the God who yearns for us and without whom we are never truly at peace. This book is written by a man with very deep roots of faith and a profound vision of the Kingdom. With great sensitivity, Allyn Benedict gently leads us into a refreshing and often startling intimacy with Christ. Lives will be transformed through this book. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dennis Wrigley&lt;/b&gt;, Co-founder and Leader, Maranatha Community, England&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Not As Orphans is transforming my small group... huge revelations... one can never stop gleaning ... We were all challenged, and continue to be, as reading the book has become an ongoing personal devotion for most of us. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;From a Small Group Leader&lt;/b&gt;, Roanoke, Virginia, USA&lt;p&gt;" />
