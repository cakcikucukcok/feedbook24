  <title>Why Jesus Won&#39;t Go Away - Philip J. Skotte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How many times have you read a book by a seasoned diplomat in the United States Foreign Service examining the universal drawing power of Jesus? With the advantage of a solid theological education and the privilege of living among communities of people world-wide with vastly different perspectives, Phil Skotte here presents richly woven insights into his studied conviction that we are all hard wired for Jesus: that Jesus is not going away. This book is a gem. Read it! Samuel Hugh Moffett Emeritus Professor of Ecumenics and Mission Princeton Theological Seminary Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has often been said that humans are hard-wired for belief in God and for religion. In Why Jesus Wont Go Away, Philip Skotte suggests that we are also hard-wired for Jesus Christ. Faith in Jesus is the most globally widespread movement in human history, and it is growing more rapidly than ever before, even in remote and unexpected places. Why Jesus takes us on a world tour to discover the surprising sources of Jesus attraction and explores the powerful impact of his attraction on the human race. Written by a seasoned diplomat, Why Jesus Wont Go Away may change your calculations about humanitys religious future. It may also change your mind about Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
