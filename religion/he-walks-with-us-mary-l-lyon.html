  <title>He Walks with Us - Mary L. Lyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God wants a relationship with us, a relationship that is rooted in His love and grounded in His forgiveness. &lt;i&gt;He Walks with Us&lt;/i&gt; is about Gods relationship with us. It is about God applying His truths to our lives. The truths presented focus our attention on God and not ourselves. It is God telling us what He has already done for us, rather than us asking what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme throughout Scripture is that man sins and God forgives. Man is unfaithful, and God is ever faithful. God walks with us even when we are walking down the wrong path. God wants us to have power over sin. He wants to build faithfulness in us. He wants to take us by the hand and walk with us down the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods walk with us begins with His living Word, Jesus Christ, and His written Word, the Bible. &lt;i&gt;He Walks with Us&lt;/i&gt; examines both and uses both to explain Gods role. Ultimately, it is all God and none of us. The truth is that we are because He is. He is the author and perfecter of our faith. It is wonderful to know that we cannot fail when God has the responsibility for our success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He Walks with Us&lt;/i&gt; is how God will succeed at that good work that He has started within us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
