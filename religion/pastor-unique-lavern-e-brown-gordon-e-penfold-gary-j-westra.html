  <title>Pastor Unique - Lavern E. Brown, Gordon E. Penfold, Gary J. Westra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ADVANCED PRAISE FOR PASTOR UNIQUE: Becoming a Turnaround Leader&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each year thousands of books are written, published, and distributed. Few are really significant works. Pastor Unique is, in my view, a significant book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Gary L. McIntosh, D.Min., Ph.D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talbot Seminary, Biola University&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Helping pastors understand themselves and their role is crucial and fundamental. So is training them in the tactics and strategies of change. Furthermore, they must learn how their personalities help or hinder leading change. I believe the process described in this book is targeted more specifically than any other I know to provide this training&lt;/p&gt;. 
&lt;p&gt; Paul Borden. Ph.D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director, Church Health Initiative&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to the authors for including The Birkman Method in their work with pastors. My father, Roger Birkman, was passionate about helping people of faith gain a clearer, more accurate understanding of self and others. The authentic kind of leadership development recommended in this book will profoundly impact pastors and the people they lead. We are proud that Birkman can play a role in the important initiative represented in Pastor Unique.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Sharon Birkman Fink, CEO&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Birkman International, Inc.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Are you still searching for that killer church health conference, that rock star pastor to imitate, or the perfect formula that will tell you how lead your church to effective service in Jesus mission? Pastors who chase dreams of high powered ministry by looking for answers outside of themselves are inevitably discouraged when they learn that what works for others wont work for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If thats your story, Pastor Unique is what youve been looking for. Inside you will learn how to use all the tools the Head of the Church has already given you  your identity, your personality, and your life experience  to become a turnaround leader in your church.&lt;/p&gt;" />
