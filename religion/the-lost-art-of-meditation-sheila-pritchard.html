  <title>The Lost Art of Meditation - Sheila Pritchard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you ever wonder if there&#39;s more to prayer than you&#39;ve so far discovered?
If you long to explore creative, two-way communication with the amazing God of the universe...
If you have a desire to plumb the depths and enough holy daring to experiment...
If you would love the familiar, well-read scriptures to seem fresh and new again...
If you&#39;re a faithful pray-er and know deep down that prayer matters, but secretly wish there was more life to it...
If you want to stay close to Jesus while discovering new paths to travel...
If you want to live your prayer in your body, in action, in creation - as well as in your head and hear...
...this book is for you.
A refreshing and inspiring book to help readers deepen their prayer life and, through it, their relationship with God. This book deals with the objection that meditation is either eastern or new age and therefore dangerous, instead showing that biblical, Christian meditation can take you closer to God. The eight chapters cover various different approaches to meditative prayer, including creative communication, meditation on the move, and what to do when words won&#39;t do." />
