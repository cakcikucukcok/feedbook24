  <title>The 30 Teachings of Mary Magdalene: How to Advance Your Soul - Eva Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;You are ready to consciously embark on the path of advancing your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;30 teachings are offered for your journey. ~ Mary Magdalene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her own words, Mary Magdalene imparts her knowledge on how to deepen the practice of spiritual advancement through 30 sacred teachings. The culmination of these teachings speaks to two planes of realization: how to personally experience the divine within, and also how to raise our souls consciousness while performing our earthly tasks. This book was woven from the authors direct experience when she agreed to follow Magdalenes step by step instructions on what turned out to be a miraculous four week journey that led to realizing her own true nature. Now Magdalene teaches us all how to connect to Source, master our minds, enter into sacred relationships, and much more. This volume was created both as a companion to the book, &lt;em&gt;A Guide for Advancing Your Soul&lt;/em&gt; and is also designed as a stand-alone for those who desire only Magdalenes words that were captured within her teachings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
