  <title>Growing Missionaries Biblically - Dr. R. Zarwulugbo Liberty, Dr. Ronald Kilpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For missionaries in the twenty-first century, change is necessary in order for them to continue to be strong and viable. &lt;i&gt;Growing Missionaries Biblically&lt;/i&gt; takes a fresh look at Christian missions and proposes a comprehensive, biblical missionary training program for short- and longterm missions. Its objective is to produce an effective, cross cultural ministry for Africa and, with some modifications, globally. The goal is to provide a postimperial, post-colonial model for training missionaries by looking to biblical guidance on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;b&gt;Dr. R. Zarwulugbo Liberty&lt;/b&gt; is a native of Liberia, Africa, with biblical, theological, and practical insights for prospective and seasoned missionaries and their supporters. The information he provides can successfully launch and sustain these missionaries in the course of their mission work. In order to accomplish his goals, he proposes the use of bicultural missionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bicultural missionary is one who has studied both his own culture and the culture of the people to be served. This missionary will not equate his or her culture with Christianity and will know and understand the practices of the culture he or she serves that can easily be incorporated and assimilated into Christianity. &lt;i&gt;Growing Missionaries Biblically&lt;/i&gt; proposes a vital curriculum for missionary preparation for cross-cultural missionary service.&lt;/p&gt;" />
