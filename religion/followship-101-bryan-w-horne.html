  <title>Followship 101 - Bryan W. Horne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in a society where leadership is applauded and celebrated, while following is seldom discussed but often demanded by those who are usually self-appointed to lead. Everybody wants to lead, but very few have ever mastered the art of following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where would we be in the body of Christ if the twelve disciples never made the decision to be followers of Jesus? I argue that we would have never heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ! Jesus called the disciples to be His followers, not His leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples walked out a three-year journey to learn how to become followers, not leaders. They were then launched into the role of leadership as a result of their ability to grow through the process of following.&lt;/p&gt;
