  <title>Growing with Purpose - Jon Walker, Rick Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This powerful daily devotional will help Purpose Driven&amp;reg; Life readers and others move deeper into God&amp;rsquo;s plan for their lives. Author Jon Walker, who has worked as an editor and writer with Rick Warren for many years, challenges readers to return God&amp;rsquo;s grace to its proper place, above sin, where love always triumphs over lists of rules, where no one is forgotten, and where everyone gets more than a second chance. Using a compelling, conversational combination of parable and humorous prose, these 366 devotionals will energize readers as they move toward a deeper, transparent relationship with God. It asks readers to make an authentic assessment of how their beliefs connect&amp;mdash;or remain disconnected&amp;mdash;with the decisions and actions they make each day. Appealing to a broad range of readers, Growing with Purpose is a fresh look at biblical truth that will transform the way men and women live their lives as believers. It&amp;rsquo;s a gift that will be read over and over again, strengthening the spiritual legacy readers hope to build in those they love.
