  <title>Truth and Its Yield - Dennis E. Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God made us for himself, to be in eternal communion with him. This one single claim makes sense of mankind, why he was created, and what it is that gives man his deepest meaning and fulfills his deepest yearnings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But are these things true? How do we know theyre true? How important is truth itself? What flows from truth? Human experience has taught us how important truth is--truth frees and falsehood enslaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something within man that needs God, created by God himself, and something given by God to meet that need. At its base, the need is for happiness, and happiness, once understood, has its source in one place alone, God himself. This truth is pivotal to mans well-being as a full human being. It is Gods revelation about this core nature of man that is essential to mans own self-understanding. St. Augustine expressed this in one simple line: Our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods own revelation of eternal life provides the very meaning for our existence. It reveals the eternal mind of the Father, what he had in mind for mankind even before creation--a being that would have life through, with, and in him. Truth has its yield. Our own happiness is linked to knowing what it is. But the truth about God is subject also to our reason. We have discovered that religious truth must stand the test of human reason, experience, and time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth and Its Yield&lt;/em&gt; deals with the very importance of truth itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
