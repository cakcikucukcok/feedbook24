  <title>The Heavens Are Telling - Lionel de Klerk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world that is changing at such a dizzying rate we as Christians and as people who sometimes cling with such a feeble grip to whatever and whomever may still give us hope are so often confronted with so many difficult questions and a testing of our faith. Questions for which, at least to our earthbound minds, there seems to be no answers.
We are faced with the question, firstly, of why it is that good people so often have to endure what seems to be an inordinate and unfair share of suffering.
We are faced with a myriad of faith options in our search for the truth.
If we are really sincere in our service to our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, we cannot help but to be grieved and perplexed by the never ending and always painful question of why our Savior had to pay the price that he did for such ungrateful children as we so often prove to be.
These are but some of the questions that I battle with on a daily basis, and I hopeno, I praythat somewhere within the pages of this book, your searching heart may find that hope that so often seems so tantalizingly illusive.
Having read through Mr De Klerks book twice, I was astounded at the simplicity of his message. I was encouraged deeply in my walk with God. Whether you are a new believer or youve been on this journey forever, this book will take you to the next level of your faith.
Blessings

It&#39;s an easy and honest read.
Stimulating a personal conversation and evaluation of one&#39;s own response to our individual journey&#39;s.
The writting style is personable in it&#39;s approach and direct in it&#39;s purpose.
Evoking a personal response to Truth,as life unfolds and demands of us.
I would recommend this read,to anyone searching.

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the writer, Lionel De Klerk, on a book well written and every word, worth reading. It was a book that once you picked it up and started reading, you just wanted to carry on to see what the next and next page said. It made me understand Gods deep and unending love for me and reading certain passages gave me answers to questions. I would recommend anybody to read this book and maybe like me, you will find answers to questions.
