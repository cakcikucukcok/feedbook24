  <title>Feeding Your Family&#39;s Soul - Donna-Marie Cooper O&#39;Boyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today&#39;s parents consistently struggle to meet their deadlines and check off their &quot;to-do&quot; lists, and are often stressed, exhausted, and lamenting. This often results in well-meaning parents putting off their children&#39;s faith formation for &quot;another time&quot; or relying on others to teach their children.  This book is uniquely suited to come to their rescue. Feeding Your Family&#39;s Soul: Dinner Table Spirituality is a vital tool to enable parents to transform a regular dinner time into a prayerful faith lesson for their elementary school to high school aged children. It will indeed help to fulfill the Catholic Church&#39;s vision for evangelization in the family and beyond. Through 52 fun and creative faith lessons (one for each week of the year), this one-of-a-kind book will encourage parents and caregivers to seize the opportunity in teaching the Catholic faith to the children (the captive audience waiting to eat!) while gathered at the dinner table, and while reminding them of the value of coming together as a family to break bread and share hearts." />
