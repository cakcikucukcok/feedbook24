  <title>The Cross of Christ - William H. Wetmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The most momentous time in all of recorded history was when Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into the world to proclaim the kingdom of God. Because He challenged the Jewish and Roman authorities with the Truth of God, He was arrested, condemned to death, nailed to the cross, died for the sins of the world, and rose from the grave. Therefore God has highly exalted Him. Christ fulfilled the reason for which the Father had sent Him into the world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the cross, our sins were exchanged for Christs righteousness. On the cross was Christ, the Righteousness of God; standing before the cross were we, sinners in need of redemption. He died as the evidence of the love of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of the cross is that we have been redeemed and reconciled to our Father and Creator. We have peace with God; we have become the children of God. He who knew no sin became sin for us. The Righteous for the unrighteous, the Sinless for the sinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the cross of Christ symbolizes the glory of the Christian gospel (I Cor. 1:17); the fact that, through this cruel and inhuman death, the debt of sin was nailed to the cross (Col. 2:14); and we, having been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20), have been freed from sin and death and made alive in God (Rom. 6:6-11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross is the symbol of Christs love, Gods power to save, and our faith in Him, who died for us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
