  <title>How God Can Use You? - Barbara L. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi. I would like to talk to you about my loving book, How God Can Use You? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He can use you in many different ways. Jesus can send you to a person to pray on them, for example. He tells you to pray for the sick people to heal their bodies or help people that need help in Jesuss name. Amen. You can be good Samaritans. For example, a ladys car stopped by the light, and two gentlemen got out of their cars and helped her put her car to the side of the road. She said, Thank you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus can bless you double or triple. It is a miracle to work and pray together as one. How you can reach out to others? Jesus warns you to pray for that person or talk to them, because they need a friend or a good listener. How can you focus on your loving family? You need to learn how to forgive them. Repent, pray, read your Bible, and communicate with one another. You will see how much peace you will have in your loving heart. Showing a lot of love is the key to keeping your family loving and together as one. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have explained in my loving book a variety of ways on how God can use you and me. Just buy it and read it in a quiet place or with your loving friends and family. You will see a change in your loving life. People or your family and friends will see that glow on you with Jesus in your loving heart. So please read my book, and after you finish reading it, you will feel good and will want to work on yourself to be a better person in Jesuss name. Amen. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember, Jesus loves you and will never leave you or forsake you. You have a good and blessed day with a smile on your loving face. Please give everybody a hug and kiss your loved ones. Please continue to pray and be nice to everybody. Also, think before you say anything. It is the key for everyone to having a happy and healthy family in Jesuss name. Amen. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you read my book, you will be a different person and be glowing each and every day with Jesus Christ. It makes you feel like you are walking side by side with Jesus. That is a blessing, and it means he is working on your loving heart. You have a good and blessed day. And thank Jesus each and every day. He will never leave you or forsake you. Please keep a smile on your face with Jesus. Amen." />
