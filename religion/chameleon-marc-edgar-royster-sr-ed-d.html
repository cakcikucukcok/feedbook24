  <title>Chameleon - Marc Edgar Royster Sr. Ed.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At one point or another, weve all been targeted or victimized by a Super Deceiver. Even as you are reading the cover of this book, unbeknownst to you, there is a very strong chance that someone you are very familiar with is lying, cheating, hustling or deceiving you. It is very possible that you are doing the same thing to someone else without you fully understanding the spiritual ramifications it holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of having as its primary instructional tool, the best-selling book [The Bible] of all times, todays Christians are in an identity crisis  we are in perilous times! And as we continue to live in perilous times, the explosive growth in WEALTH, the POPULARITY of people, places and things, the unencumbered SENSUALITY displayed in various forms, the charm and CHARISMA of people who are Christian in name only, and people who are adept at manipulating FEAR tactics to paralyze or channel a persons movement, has allowed an insidious platform for Super Deceivers to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a CHAMELEON, who is capable of changing colors and appearances based on the environment it has settled into, a Super Deceiver does it in order to wreak havoc on you, your relationships, your finances, and your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to understand and reclaim your identity, your purpose, and your influence as a true believer and follower of Jesus Christ, so that you, too, can expose and counter the five faces of a Super Deceiver.&lt;/p&gt;" />
