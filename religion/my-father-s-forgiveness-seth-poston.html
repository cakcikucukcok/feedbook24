  <title>My Father’S Forgiveness - Seth Poston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why the hurts of the past still haunt you? Why the things that people have said or done still plague your subconscious? Could it be that the forgiveness you thought you had extended actually wasnt forgiveness at all? You may have said the words, but often they are hollow words. This is what forgiveness has become to most people. We hear these words day in and day out, Im sorry and I forgive you. But forgiveness is much more meaningful than that. There is a deep journey that accompanies true forgiveness, and it cannot be found in words alone. Forgiveness is a powerful and personal experience that is finely laced throughout Scripture. Forgiveness is deeply rooted in the Word of God, and we can only find it if we are willing to saturate ourselves in the Scripture in search of a deeper meaning. This forgiveness will carry each of us on a journey of personal transformation that is redemptive in its work. My Fathers Forgiveness guides you toward the light of Gods Word as it illuminates true biblical forgiveness. If we allow God to unveil our eyes with His truths, we will find that we really can embrace our Fathers forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
