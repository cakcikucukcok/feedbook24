  <title>My Life in Truth - David T Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story you are about to read actually happened, the places and characters are real, and many are still alive today, and this story is written in poetry. The reason that it was done in poetry is that it is about my salvation, how I came to know Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour, and the events that actually happened to bring that about, which was by all accounts a miracle of God.
In my Church, my recognised gifts are encouragement and helps, the latter being best known as works of service, and the main reason for having my life story published is to encourage others that they also have a story to tell, and there are times when that story needs to be told in order to encourage others also. We all have a story to tell, and that story is unique, no one else has a story quite like you do, but to be able to put your story down on paper and publish it as a book is something else. I spent many hours recollecting thoughts of my past life, and trying to remember bits and pieces of my past that I had forgotten about, but were essential in telling my story in an exact way.
But even in light of the above, never a day goes by where I dont give some thought to the events of my past and what happened during those past years, not to mention just how far I had come since surrendering to Christ. One thing I have discovered since publishing my first book, unless you are doing things for yourself due to a desire just to put your experiences in book form before your story slips into oblivion, save your money and your time, because it really is a lot of hard work, unless doors of opportunity magically open up and give you a chance in a lifetime to make it big in publishing.
I have included other poems as well, some of which have never been published before, but being a re-launch of the original first book, some things had to be modified and added to, as well as changed, in order to have the publishing of this issue as hassle free as possible.
Even though the poetry in this book is rather long, I found that it was necessary to accommodate the story as a whole, as it is about my life story, noting that some people have written entire books just on their life. I have attempted to make my story as brief as possible, without going into too much detail, which I felt would cause the reader to lose interest in the story and therefore they would miss the important theme of my story.
In any case, I trust that my story would not only encourage you, but would stir you to action in consideration of telling your story, and thereby being an encouragement and inspiration to others. May God bless all who read My Life In Truth,
David T. Gilbert." />
