  <title>Does God Suffer? - Thomas Weinandy, O.F.M.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The immense suffering in the modern world, especially in the light of the Holocaust, has had a profound impact on the contemporary understanding of God and his relationship to human suffering.  There has been a growing acceptance that God himself suffers in solidarity and love with those who suffer. Weinandy&#39;s comprehensive presentation resolutely challenges this view of God and suffering, arguing from scripture and from the philosophical and theological tradition of the Fathers and Aquinas. He maintains that a God who is impassible is more loving and compassionate than a suffering God. He also argues that it is the Son of God&#39;s experience of suffering as a man that is truly redemptive and life-giving." />
