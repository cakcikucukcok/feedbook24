  <title>The Gospel According to Job - W. Robert McClelland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Those who are familiar with McClellands other books know they are in for a thought-provoking treat worth cussing and discussing!  So why, he asks, should  people be interested in a GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOB?  For the same reason that the Book of Job is included in the Bible, he argues.  In the wisdom of the Church and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the Book of Job becomes Sacred Scripture to keep the conversation about God honest!  McClelland goes on to suggest that Christ is Gods Apology to the world for His questionable behavior in the Old Testament, and particularly, His need to use Jobs family and their lives as stakes in a wager to bolster His Egos insecurity!  Gods Apology made flesh in Jesus is His Egos act of Reconciliation -- not merely forgiving our sins -- indeed, God does not even count them against us.  Rather, God, Himself, has taken responsibility for His role in creating the problem of our alienation.  Christs death, therefore, is an atonement for Gods Sin as well as ours.  The culmination of McClellands thesis is that God has entrusted this AMAZING Message to us and is once again betting on us to win the bet for Him!  As usual, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOB is not only a good read, but well worth your consideration!  Genesis Literary Review" />
