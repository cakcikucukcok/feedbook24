  <title>Carved in Stone - Carol DeWitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a must read for all Christians. The morals of our society have taken such a steep decline. Many people are searching for the next thing that will bring them happiness. We only need to hear or read the news to realize that this unrest is bringing discontent and heartache to much of the world. Our Lord never intended for us to live such a dreary existence. Our Lords desire is for us to live in freedom by following his perfect plan for our lives. Scripture tells us-The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our loving Lord gave us directions on how we are to love and honor Him and keep from hurting and harming our neighbor. This law of love is The Ten Commandments. These commands were of such importance to our Lord that he gave them to us, not once but three times. The last two times they were written on stone as a lasting reminder to his followers.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
These commands were faithfully taught, displayed, and passed through all generations. They need to be taught as they once were. Jesus told his disciples, Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (Matt. 5:18) &lt;/p&gt;" />
