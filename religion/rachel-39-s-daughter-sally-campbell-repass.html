  <title>Rachel&#39;s Daughter - Sally Campbell Repass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The saga of &quot;For the Love of Rachel&quot; continues in &quot;Rachel&#39;s Daughter.&quot; Jennifer Rose Parker was raised on the Parker Ranch in Laurel, Montana. She was the beautiful daughter of Rachel Hargrove Parker and Dr. Mitch Parker, who was killed in a car accident, seven months before Jennifer was born. Rachel later met and married, Grayson Sterling, who was the only father Jennifer ever knew.
In high school she met and fell in love with Gabe Colter, whom her mother thought was not good enough for her daughter. She defied her mother and dated him anyway.
After high school she went to the University of California to become a doctor, following in her deceased father&#39;s footsteps. She and Gabe parted ways, even though it was very hard for both of them. They were deeply in love. Determined to get her education, she sacrificed love.
Both she and Gabe faced many disappointments and heartbreaks during the eight long years she was in medical school. Would their faith in God and love for each other be enough to bring them back together or would it be too late?" />
