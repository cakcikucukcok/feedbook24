  <title>One Thousand Years with Jesus: The Coming Messianic Kingdom - Matthew Bryce Ervin, Michael L. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The time is coming when the world will be radically changed for the better. It will last for a thousand years, bookended by resurrections, first of the just and then of the unjust. Satan will be chained in the abyss, no longer free to influence the nations. The saints will reign alongside the King of kings, Jesus Christ. This is a time that will begin after the return of the Messiah and end with Satan&#39;s total defeat and the judgment of sinners. It is the very culmination of history, a transition away from the fallen world into the perfection of the eternal state. This is a time known as the Millennium and the Messianic Kingdom. An understanding of this critical age makes the Bible come together as one metanarrative. It helps tell the story of the Scriptures." />
