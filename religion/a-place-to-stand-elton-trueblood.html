  <title>A Place to Stand - Elton Trueblood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Place to Stand&lt;/em&gt; is addressed to those who recognize the need for a strong stand from which to operate in the confusion of contemporary thought. Ours has become an age, says Trueblood, in which people simply do not know what to think. Trueblood is convinced that there is an objective truth about everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Trueblood explains what Christians believe and why, exploring through each chapter rational Christianity, a center of certitude, the living God, the reality of prayer, and the life everlasting. He is convinced that part of the weakness of the Christian movement in this age has been the relative lack of emphasis upon belief. However good and important service to humanity is, it loses its motivating power when the sustaining beliefs are allowed to wither. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Place to Stand&lt;/em&gt; is a classic text that shows it is possible, without contradiction or confusion, to hold a Christian position which is both evangelical and rational. &lt;/p&gt;" />
