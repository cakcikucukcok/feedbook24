  <title>Faithful Education: Themes and Values for Teaching, Learning, and Leading - Amy Lynn Dee, Gary  Tiffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book presents nine biblical themes in essays authored by veteran educators who surprise and affirm readers with personal accounts of how these themes shaped their practice in education. Culture, faith, and praxis often inform one another, and in an era of increased scrutiny and criticism of education, educators hold tremendous power in shaping the education of students by incorporating these values into daily practice. A cycle of improvement follows purposeful attention to biblical principles, and provides educators with the means to reclaim and reshape our profession.  When teachers are willing to examine their practice in light of biblical themes and values, learning becomes meaningful and lasting. Often that learning goes beyond the formal educational process. Educators serve as role models, and the experiences we provide for our students shape who they become and how they view life. A faithful educator encourages positive dispositions of the heart, mind, and spirit. The charge and responsibility of developing the hearts, minds, and spirits of those who enter our classrooms, and the magnitude of the call to teach these students, requires faithful recognition of these biblical themes." />
