  <title>The Holy Workshop Of Virtue - Rowan Greer, Tim Vivian, Maged S. A. Mikhail, Tim Vivian...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saint John the Little was a monk and &lt;i&gt;hegumen&lt;/i&gt; of Scetis (Wadi Natrun) during the first great period of early Egyptian monasticism. The &lt;i&gt;Apophthegmata&lt;/i&gt; preserve some fifty sayings by or about him (see CS 59, 85 &#39;96).
