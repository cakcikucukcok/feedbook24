  <title>The Autobiography of an Extraterrestrial Saga: I Am Thyron - Craig Campobasso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A citizen in The Galacterian Alignment of Space Peoples and Planets, Thyron is an ExtraTerrestrial Titan with a highly evolved soul, but born with a duality disorder. In this parable of the souls journey towards perfection and rebirth, Thyron must merge his Light and Dark to evolve into a Being spiritually strong enough to lead others towards the Light. Archangel Michael, the Universal Sovereign, orders him into The Shadow Chamber, to force him to look deep into the Darkness within himself. Once he has conquered his own Shadow Self, Michael sends Thyron to meet with the imprisoned Rebel Archangel Lucifer to take down his statement before his Tribunal. What happens next in Thyrons story will leave you wondering not only about your very own existence, but whats secretly happening on Earth right now.
Its time to finally reveal the secrets hidden inside the vaults of Universal Magic. Get ready Star Trek and Star Wars fans for the next phase of entertainment, for you are about to meet the extraterrestrials--your cosmic family!
&quot;Speaking not only as an author, but an avid reader, I havent had any book hold my attention like Craigs book has. If you liked or loved Avatar, youll be ecstatic about this book. I can also see this as a great movie. Kudos to you, Craig, for this marvelous book and good luck with its success, although we dont need luck when something is great and this is.&quot;
