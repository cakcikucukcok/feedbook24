  <title>Salvation and Modernity: Intellectuals and Faith in Contemporary China - Fredrik F채llman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Salvation and Modernity presents an interpretation of the phenomenon of intellectual Christians in contemporary Chinese society, with special focus paid to Liu Xiaofeng, by exploring the main issues of faith, salvation, and the quest for a modern China. Author Fredrik FSllman investigates similar developments in earlier centuries by linking past and present forms of cultural Christian phenomenon, and the beliefs and ideas of Liu Xiaofeng and other scholars. Their focus on Christianity implies a criticism of traditional Chinese value systems, in particular Confucianism and Daoism. The introduction of Christian theology and values into Chinese academia is a way of creating greater understanding for Western culture. Many cultural Christians argue that this advanced understanding is a prerequisite for establishing a modern China. Issues of personal faith and identity are also central in respect to modernity as well as to individual and national salvation. Post-Mao China is seeking a new foundation for values and cultural Christians have a definite role to play. Since the choice of Christianity is an expression of individuality, freedom, and criticism of political structures, cultural Christians will ultimately help in laying foundations for a theology in Chinese relations between the intellectuals and the Church. The impact and importance of cultural Christians is becoming more visible now than ever before." />
