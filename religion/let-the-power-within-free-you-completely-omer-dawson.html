  <title>Let the Power Within Free You Completely - Omer Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The truth shall prevail; that is the reason author Omer Dawson wrote &lt;em&gt;Let the Power within Free You Completely&lt;/em&gt;. Much is being done at this time for the betterment of mankind and the world as we know it. We must all rejoice in the knowledge that entities on all levels are working for the sake of all of Gods creations. Jesus died on the cross to free us from sin. Spiritual growth is held back when we truly believe that we were born in sin and will always be sinners. Complete faith will clarify this idea for all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Never be concerned with where others might be on the path of life, as we all are where we need to be at the moment. We must learn to live in the now. The past is behind us, and the future is yet to come. We are the trusted guardians of a great trust on this plane, and we must do what we can to become responsible caretakers of this trust. A good place for each of us to begin would be to keep the faith.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Let the Power within Free You Completely&lt;/em&gt;, created by automatic writing directly from the Holy Spirit, Dawson explains that each soul who lives the truth can help those around him or her, living the truth as it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;should be lived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
