  <title>How to Argue like Jesus - Joe Carter, John Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Uses Jesus&#39; words and actions found in the New Testament to systematically evaluate his rhetorical stylings, drawing real lessons from his teachings that today&#39;s readers can employ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jesus of Nazareth never wrote a book, held political office, or wielded a sword. He never gained sway with the mighty or influential. He never took up arms against the governing powers in Rome. He was a lower-class worker who died an excruciating death at the age of thirty-three. Yet, in spite of all odds-obscurity, powerlessness, and execution-his words revolutionized human history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Argue Like Jesus&lt;/em&gt; examines the life and words of Jesus and describes the various ways in which he sought-through the spoken word, his life, and his disciples-to reach others with his message. The authors then pull some very simple rhetorical lessons from Jesus&#39; life that readers can use today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Christian and non-Christian leaders in just about any field can improve their ability to communicate effectively by studying the words and methods of history&#39;s greatest communicator.&lt;/p&gt;" />
