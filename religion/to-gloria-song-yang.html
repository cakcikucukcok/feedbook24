  <title>To Gloria - Song Yang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The joy of her pregnancy was shattered by the discovery of her baby&#39;s developmental problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why don&#39;t you want an abortion? &quot; doctor asked. &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Because it&#39;s a life! &quot; she answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My Child, rely on me; I will take care of you! &quot; God called. She followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wrote, &quot;When I came to God asking for His wisdom to understand the whole situation, it was as if a light lit up inside me. God fills each life with beautiful meaning. God doesn&#39;t favor those who are strong or smart. He loves us just as we are, unconditionally! I made up my mind to love my baby unconditionally and to carry her with a grateful heart, because I was walking with a beautiful life. &quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did, and God was with her. It wasn&#39;t an easy journey. She shed tears and dealt with anguish and heartache. And yet she had peace, enjoyed sweet times with her husband and her unborn baby, and even experienced miracles. By the mercy of God, she and her husband had chance to hold their baby, Gloria. Their time with Gloria was filled with tender love, and they sent their baby off with songs and prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life after Gloria&#39;s death was even harder, but God healed her broken heart miraculously, in a way of love, faith, and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection of tender, loving letters that Song Yang wrote to her late daughter, Gloria, turned out to be a love story of Gloria&#39;s short life and a praising song of God&#39;s incomprehensible love. May you find love, comfort, and hope in this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
