  <title>I Know Why Young Men Rage - Thomas Johnson The Benevolent Tinker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you ever wonder about whats out there? The one thing that religion prohibits is the right to question. In the real world we are all free to ask that we may grow. It is the relationship between the Creator and the created that is the beginning of our understanding. And this is the first step in the finding of faith in the discovery of what love is and in the wonder of being loved. When the answer is given we can move forward into the new day. We have right now and the journey begins with our first breath and ends with our last sigh. In between it is the miracles unfolding that are the treasures we keep forever. The one who gives is the true gift and there in the giving is the miracle itself- that we are remembered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
