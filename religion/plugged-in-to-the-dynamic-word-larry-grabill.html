  <title>Plugged-In to the Dynamic Word - Larry Grabill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We know that the Word of God is living and powerful, with the potential to dramatically impact the heart for God. The passages of the Bible enlighten and enliven us, but most of us have a limited view of how the parts of the Word relate to each other. What if we could have a comprehensive grasp of the whole of Scripture, so that we could see the big picture? What if we could see the whole illuminated by the truths that bind the parts as one book?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plugged-in to the Dynamic Word&lt;/em&gt; familiarizes us with the thought form and allows us to see the parts of the Bible as a united message. In this experience, we can subject our hearts to the collective impact of the Word, be more in touch with Gods basic thoughts, and draw closer to the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A builder could introduce the parts of a house to a totally uninformed person, who could admire the straightness of the stud, the massiveness of the floor joist, the structure of the truss rafter, and so on. But only when he sees that each part is intended to connect to the other parts to form a house can he fully appreciate their value and joyfully look forward to having a home from the parts he originally admired.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plugged-in to the Dynamic Word&lt;/em&gt; shows the orderly connectivity of the parts of the Bible to portray a whole spiritual house of Gods truth and grace housing His people.&lt;/p&gt;
