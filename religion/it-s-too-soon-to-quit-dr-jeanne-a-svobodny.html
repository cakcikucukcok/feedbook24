  <title>It’S Too Soon to Quit - Dr.  Jeanne A. Svobodny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is happening to me? Why am I constantly terrified? Why are these strange and scary feelings plaguing me and robbing me of lifes joys? Why wont they go away? What is wrong? Why Lord? Why wont you rescue me?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jeanne Svobodny asked these questions during a very difficult time in her life.  Jeanne had experienced what she describes as an idyllic life as a Christian wife, mother, daughter, teacher, and athlete until she unexpectedly experienced overwhelming fear. The physical sensations she repeatedly felt as a result of horrific fear including rapid heartbeats, nausea, dizziness, sweating, chills, and loud ringing in her ears were petrifying and shook her confidence to the core.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Its Too Soon to Quit, this determined woman describes her journey coping with an unexpected season in her life which was filled with dreadful panic attacks. By writing her story, Jeanne hopes the lessons she learned will bring hope to others who may be going through a similar season of suffering.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jeanne vulnerably shares her early experiences with extreme anxiety and her later diagnosis of panic disorder. Because of the severity of the attacks, she thought she was going crazy. Functioning through simple, routine daily tasks became extremely challenging for her. After many years of living with excruciating fear while searching for answers, relief finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Read about the amazing promises of God and His personal whispers which sustained Jeanne during this season of her life. Take heart and Run with perseverance, the race that is set before you (Hebrews 12:1-3) and Let the peace of God guard your hearts and minds (Colossians 3:15).&lt;/p&gt;" />
