  <title>Buddhist Astrology: Chart Interpretation from a Buddhist Perspective - Jhampa Shaneman, Jan Angel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book Buddhist Astrology offers us a glimpse into how to view astrology not as one&#39;s destiny but as an influence. Astrology is not a religion and Buddhist Astrology helps us understand things where we are the one making the decisions, not something distant and unseen. Astrology from the Buddhist perspective is one of interdependence. Interdependence brings to mind many factors that are influences to body and mind. One can look at genetics, parents, siblings, education, social standing, cultural and ethnic influences, all together as being factors affecting the personality and attitude. All of these factors are immediate and directly in our environment, so they are considered primary influences on us. From the Buddhist point of view, astrology would fall into a secondary category of influence. It is also considered to be an environmental influence. It is secondary because it is at a distance from us, not immediate and visible. It is environmental because it is part of the physical world. This classification of astrology is important if we are to consider astrology realistically. It would not be useful to over-emphasize astrology to the exclusion of other more primary influences. We are the product of interdependence, astrology plays a role in that interdependence, but it is not a primary influence." />
