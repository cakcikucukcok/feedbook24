  <title>Intimacy and the Sacred - Habeeb Alli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Intercourse with ones spouse is part of being human. Alli has taken such a subject which has cultural taboos all around it, and brought it to the reader with religious light. Something that is rare in the English language. A must read.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tahir Anwar&lt;/b&gt;, Imam, U.S.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sex is a normal function of life...so normal that every single human being owes its existence to it. However because of the insanity that has gripped the world in terms of porn this book acts as sane voice. Sex is sacred and we need to take back the sheets from the porn industry. Many young people are drawn to porn and what is learnt from its pages/screens is all wrong. Women are to be respected. And in the arena of love/sex between married people only true knowledge can bring joy. This book carrying such knowledge should be required reading by all young people as it discusses the topic of intimacy in a halal manner&quot;.
