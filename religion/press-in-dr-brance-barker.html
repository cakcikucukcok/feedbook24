  <title>Press In - Dr. Brance Barker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you feel distant from God? Have you ever felt like God wasnt listening to you or that &lt;br /&gt;
He didnt care? Do you feel like you are having trouble hearing from God or seeing Him at work in your life? Are you having difficulty spending time with the Lord? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Press In, the 40-Day Journal, Bible Study, and Prayer Challenge, will open your eyes to Gods presence in your life and allow you to see His hand on you in a more personal way. Journaling, as a spiritual discipline, is not just one more thing that should be done but an incredible avenue and opportunity to enhance the spiritual disciplines of daily prayer and Bible study in your life. By traveling down this 40-day journey of journaling, my prayer for you is that you will experience God in a fresh, new, and intimate way. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Press In will guide you through the process of journaling, Bible study, and prayer to help &lt;br /&gt;
you with the following: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recognize the benefits and blessings of seeking the Lord &lt;br /&gt;
Set the stage: Getting started with your quiet times &lt;br /&gt;
Provide practical tips, strategies, and examples from experienced journalers &lt;br /&gt;
Draw closer to God &lt;br /&gt;
Learn who you are and Whose you are &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of Press In is to help you grow closer to God and recognize His hand on your life, &lt;br /&gt;
as well as learn how to record and remember His faithfulness in your life so that you can &lt;br /&gt;
move forward in the strength of His presence. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Press In allows you to dive in on Day 1 with a freedom to just get started without fear of &lt;br /&gt;
whether you are doing it the right way. You will walk away equipped with a tool belt of &lt;br /&gt;
various approaches to consider as you develop your unique approach to spiritual journaling &lt;br /&gt;
so that you can press on in your journey as you press in to His presence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
