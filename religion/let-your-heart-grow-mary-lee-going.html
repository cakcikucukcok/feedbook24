  <title>Let Your Heart Grow - Mary Lee Going</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Bible was written long ago in a land we would call foreign and for a people without the Internet! Their culture was different. Their language was different. Their day-to-day living was different, too. How could the Bible be relevant to us now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truths we find in the Bible transcend time, but if we put them in the language and situations of today, they may be more understandable to twenty-first century people. We can use these biblical truths to identify who we are and who God wants us to be. Then we allow God to grow our heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy reading these contemporary stories that can give you an insight into ageless truths. Each devotional in Let Your Heart Grow focuses on Godly truths that will help you explore how to live a Christ-centered life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devotions are terrific as an individual study, but they can also be shared and discussed in a small-group setting, whether it is a family dinner, a youth group gathering, or a friends get-together. They encourage pondering, praying, and practicing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start becoming a better you with Let Your Heart Grow!&lt;/p&gt;" />
