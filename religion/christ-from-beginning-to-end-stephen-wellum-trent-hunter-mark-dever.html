  <title>Christ from Beginning to End - Stephen Wellum, Trent Hunter, Mark Dever</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How we see Christ and how we read the Bible are directly related. And while many people are encouraged to know that the Bible is &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; Christ, they end up discouraged when they can&#39;t explain how the Bible&#39;s various parts relate to him. Some attempt to force the pieces of the Bible together, making superficial jumps to Jesus. Others give up trying to understand the Bible altogether, losing confidence in God&#39;s Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how can we read the Bible in such way as to grow in the knowledge of Jesus Christ on every page of Scripture? We need a &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; reading of Scripture, one that reads the Bible according to its nature, its structure, and its own agenda. You&#39;ll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;read the Bible according to according to three biblical contexts: the immediate context, the unfolding context, and the final context&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;recognize how different parts of the Bible interlock with other parts of the Bible, fitting together like a puzzle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;embrace the story of the Bible as our own, to live this story out, and to share this story with our neighbors and the nations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Wellum and Hunter explore the connecting thread of covenant and how it ties several key biblical figures together. They also unpack some of the trickier questions Bible readers face today including how the Old Testament law applies today as well as several apologetic challenges to the Old Testament. For the first time, you will be able to see the Bible&#39;s multi-layered story and how it is held together by one plan of God to glorify himself in salvation. You&#39;ll come away with a clearer and more profound vision of our own need as sinners, of God in all of his grace, and of Jesus in all of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;" />
