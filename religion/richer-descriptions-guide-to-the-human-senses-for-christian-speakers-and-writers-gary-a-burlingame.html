  <title>Richer Descriptions:  Guide to the Human Senses for Christian Speakers and Writers - Gary A Burlingame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a unique manual that explores all nine human senses in seven chapters for use by Christian speakers and writers. Applications are encouraged by exercises, a speaker&amp;#39;s checklist, writing samples, and a writer&amp;#39;s guide. Bible references encourage a deeper appreciation of being created by God for a sensory experience. The common senses of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing are covered as well as thermoception, nociception, equilibrioception, and the kinesthetic sense. With two degrees in environmental science, Gary A. Burlingame has researched and lectured internationally on the application of the human senses to make observations of man made and natural environments. Scientists continue to unlock the mysteries of the human senses because they know how vital our senses are to a healthy and enjoyable life. After presenting this information to a writer&amp;#39;s group, he was encouraged to develop a manual because there was nothing like it on the market. Thus, this book&amp;#39;s purpose is to draw on the latest scientific knowledge while reflecting back on what God has revealed in the Bible to better equip speakers so they can more deeply engage their audiences, and to help writers bring to life their characters and scenes in their stories. Richer Descriptions is written as a handy guide for use by speakers and writers. It provides a good resource for writers&amp;#39; and speakers&amp;#39; conferences. Pastors will find this guide full of exciting information and ideas for enriching their sermons. Fiction, non-fiction, science fiction, fantasy, romance, and mystery writers will find helpful tips for making richer sensory descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
