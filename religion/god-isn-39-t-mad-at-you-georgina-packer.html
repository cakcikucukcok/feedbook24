  <title>God Isn&#39;t Mad at You - Georgina Packer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bible says in Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart. This is such a simple invitation to a relationship that will only bring life and peace into ones life. However, too many times today we find people seeking after men or women instead of the One who can supply their every need. It is good to listen to good teaching from Gods Word but in the end, it is we who must decide for ourselves about our lives. Any other way will certainly lead us in a path away from God. He wants a personal relationship with each and every one of us. He wants to bless and deliver us from situations which are pulling us down. He wants to pick us up when we fall and restore us into a right relationship with Him. He is the God Who is more than able to supply all that we could ever ask for or desire. It is His purpose for us to realize the love He has for us above all else. Many of the things which come into our lives are of our own doing and have nothing to do with God. It is our poor choices or a wrong path that we have taken which leads us into situations which it seems that there is no deliverance from. But God is the God Who is bigger than any situation and He is more powerful than any bad choice that we have made. The only requirement is for us to trust Him and surrender all to Him. In 1 Peter 5:7 it reads:  casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.
I heard someone say once I dont know what the future holds, but I know Who holds the future. We can rest in the promises of God and learn of Him and we will have success even when it seems an impossibility for a situation to turn around. So when we seek Him, we can claim the promise in Jeremiah 29:11-13:  For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.
Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.
So lets believe in a Father whose grace will carry us through any obstacle and lets believe in a Saviour Who wants to perform miracles the same way He did when He walked this earth. He is as near as the mention of His Name, Jesus." />
