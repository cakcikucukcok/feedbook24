  <title>The Road Home: A Guided Journey to Church Forgiveness and Reconciliation - Darrell Puls, Everett L. Worthington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Remarkably, as many as sixty-six thousand churches are in conflict at this moment, and one-third of those will experience permanent damage. Though Christ commanded his followers to forgive, we often don&#39;t, and that lack of forgiveness poisons all of our relationships. Churches are particularly vulnerable to unforgiveness for a simple reason--no one has taught us what forgiveness actually is, how it benefits the forgiver and the forgiven, and, most importantly, how to forgive. The Road Home provides a pathway to forgiveness and healthy reconciliation for churches wounded by conflict. While the road it follows is not easy--just as forgiving is not easy--the result is an explosion of grace and restoration, taking relationships beyond where they were to where they were meant to be." />
