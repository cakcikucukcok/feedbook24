  <title>Life in the Heart of God - Pastor Margaret Duttera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are a spiritual being, having a human experience. Do you have a clear sense of that reality? Do you believe that you are a spiritual being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thirty years, I have been a pastor within a traditional church, one that is both progressive in its thinking and firmly rooted in love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News flash! Those within traditional churches and those outside church of any kind are often confused, uncertain, and detached from what I call relevant faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you describe yourself as a person of faith? If the answer is yes or if the answer is no, &lt;i&gt;Life in the Heart of God &lt;/i&gt;will take you on a journey that will clarify what you do believe and what you do not believe. Most importantly, you will gain insight and affirmation related to your true divine identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in a churchgoing family or simply attending church does not guarantee that your faith will be relevant in your daily life. For faith to be relevant, it must make sense. When faith is relevant in your daily life, who you are, whose you are, and the purpose of your life becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering who you are, who you truly are, is of great importance. Alone, the physical world that is finite obscures your ability to see the infinite, and you easily fall victim to your fears. When you are able to understand your life on this earth to be a progressive journey from divine light to divine light, you will enter your personal spiritual dawn and awaken to life in and from the heart of God.
