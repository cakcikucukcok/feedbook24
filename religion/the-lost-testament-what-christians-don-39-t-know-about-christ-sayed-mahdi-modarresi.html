  <title>The Lost Testament: What Christians Don&#39;t Know About Christ - Sayed Mahdi Modarresi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They have been closely guarded for centuries.. Painstakingly and meticulously preserved at great risk to their keepers. Now, they are being revealed to the world, giving a glimpse of who Jesus really was and providing timeless answers for timely questions. Renowned scholar, Sayed M. Modarresi, searches for the lost words of Christ within other religious traditions, uncovering words that have been lost for two-thousand years. Bequeathed by the heirs of Abraham through Ishmael and his descendants far from the political turmoil of Roman Judea, the social upheaval of the early church, and &amp;mdash; crucially &amp;mdash; the perversion of opportunistic impostors. These passages reveal a different side to Jesus, transforming the prevalent image of a placid spiritual healer to a radical transformer who challenged the status quo with a vexatious pose reminiscent of a revolutionary. In a world marred by hate, inequality, and corruption, the lost words of Christ are a felicitous contribution to public discourse and a must read for his followers, as well as anyone searching for the unsullied truth about Jesus and his newfangled worldview. Providing short reflections on each quotation, the author shares these insightful epigrams and attempts to exalt humanity to its uppermost potential using the sagacious vision of one of the most influential men to have ever walked the earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
