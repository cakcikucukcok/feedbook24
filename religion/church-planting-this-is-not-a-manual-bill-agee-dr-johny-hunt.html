  <title>Church Planting: This Is Not a Manual - Bill Agee, Dr.Johny Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In our world today there is no shortage of books and manuals that tell a person how a church should be planted. In most cases the books and manuals will highlight and specialize in one aspect or one methodology of church planting.
The book, by its very title, Church Planting: This Is Not a Manual, sets itself apart from all the rest. Although certainly not a manual, it is filled with insights, real-life stories, and lessons learned through experience that will assist any church planter as he moves forward with his call from God to plant a church.
This is the story of church planting as a lifestyle. Much of what a church planter needs when he gets to the field cannot be found in a manual. Much of what he needs is to be found in life experience lived at the feet of Jesus.
Church planting is not a career choice. It is a calling to a lifestyle. The Agee family has lived the church planting lifestyle together for more than thirty-eight years. Their story of Gods call, Gods provision, Gods sustaining power, and Gods grace will be a blessing to all who will take the time to read this book." />
