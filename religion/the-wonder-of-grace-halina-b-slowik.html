  <title>The Wonder of Grace - Halina B. Slowik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hear the messages of the Lords teaching into the the life of His follower: of His love, peace and harmony of thought she received throughout her years of journaling with Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She began to receive messages of the truth of His ways and promised the Lord to reveal those truths to all people of the world, as He requested of her, so that they would come to know Him, understand Gods wisdom, knowledge, and promises of His heartfelt desire to have them enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It opens to the hearts: of the faithful and to those who hold little or no faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It speaks to all souls: of Gods wishes, desires, and hopes upon His people of the universe to know of His great love for all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It calls upon all people: to come to the Lord in their heart and mind through prayer, for faith and hope, to follow in His truths, and to open your heart to Him. He who awaits your call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journey of profound beauty: in the telling to all those God calls to follow Him in prayer, peace, love, and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
