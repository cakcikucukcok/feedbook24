  <title>A Light in the Darkness - C. Ernie Nivens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There was a time when life in a small town in the South meant it was safe for a child to wander the neighborhood alone. In A Light in the Darkness: Insights of a Christian Southern Gentleman, author Ernie Nivens recounts how he took advantage of that freedom and watched and learned from what he saw around him. From the cautionary tale of his cousin Junior to his delight at the many celebrations of southern life, Nivens gives us a loving portrait of a Christians life in the South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in life, he would become a popular speaker around the world, first through his twenty-year calling as a United Methodist minister and then through his twenty-plus years as a financial adviser. This unique path has provided him with a distinct view into the depths of human life and hearts. His charming vignettes seek to lift the spirit and challenge the hearta celebration of Gods presence in our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern-style Christianity echoes from generation to generation with a faith based on the core of the Gospel. In A Light in the Darkness, discover and rediscover what this faith and culture is all about.&lt;/p&gt;" />
