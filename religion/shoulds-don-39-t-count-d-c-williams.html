  <title>Shoulds! Don&#39;t Count - D. C. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This twenty-eight year journey toward clarity and integrity has, in a nutshell, exposed simple windows of human choice. From choice comes humanity or the lack thereof. God provided the planet, and he often reminds us that we are mere tenants. We, as the evolved human occupants, create the culture through free will. I believe that, over the past twenty-eight years, our choices have been more clearly exposed and defined than ever before. The communication age has given us a real-time, up-front view to clearly experience each lesson. If clarity is what you seek, the windows presented here will be of great value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Periodically, we are ushered back to the basics, when a reset of our human barometer, which measures our collective value to our planet and ourselves, is needed. We must not lose our true spiritual and compassionate humanity to the negative, debilitating acts of some. Think, and should no more is the ultimate theme throughout this journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a path which allows us to Step Out Of The Shoulds is, in itself, worthy of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives begin with had to breathe and end with had to stop breathing. Had, have, and should are the metaphoric brick and mortar of our physical lives, between our first and last breath. As I have progressed in life, it became an apparent fact that shoulds dont count.&lt;/p&gt;" />
