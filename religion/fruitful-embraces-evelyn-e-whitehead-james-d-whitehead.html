  <title>Fruitful Embraces - Evelyn E. Whitehead, James D. Whitehead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sexuality and justice often seem odd bedfellows. Sexual embraces of intimacy and passion thrive in our private lives, while justice safeguards the laws and duties that govern the public realm. Yet intuitively, we sense there are deeper connections. Both sexuality and justice support the holistic ideal proclaimed by the early Christian writer Ireneaus: the glory of God is the human person fully alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn and James Whitehead combine professional expertise as a psychologist and historian of religion as well as personal experiences and extensive research to explore the interplay of sexuality, love, and justice on the spiritual journey today. While drawing on biblical themes and contemporary psychological insight, the Whiteheads examine modern experiences of attachment and vulnerability, marriage and friendship, compassion and sexual diversity, and the psychological and spiritual experiences of transgender personsa new and often bewildering consideration for many Christians. Included is a reflection on a prophetic Christian ministry in support of sexuality and justice that illustrates the importance of moral awareness and sensual attunement to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fruitful Embraces&lt;/i&gt; utilizes Christian theology and effective pastoral ministry to explore the vital connections between sexuality and Christian spirituality and links between compassion and justice that will encourage anyone on a spiritual journey to open their hearts and minds to the extravagant diversity of creation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
