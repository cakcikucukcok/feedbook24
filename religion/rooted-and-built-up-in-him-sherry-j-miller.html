  <title>Rooted and Built up in Him - Sherry J. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many are searching for the truth but have no idea where it can be found. Others know and accept the truth of the gospel but need to grow spiritually through exposure to Gods transforming Word. This Bible study is effective for both. It can be used as a personal study or as a group study. The study starts with the foundation of salvation and then covers the many faceted subject of spiritual growth. Growing in Christ requires effort. It requires making goals. It requires commitment. This book will encourage you along that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known Jim and Sherry Miller for twenty years. Sherrys love for evangelism and theology has always challenged me. I am thrilled for the body of Christ that Sherry has focused her passion for discipleship into writing. Her studies in this book will mature both the discipler and the disciple in the rich treasures of the gospel. Your questions will be answered. Your faith will find traction. Your freedom will be celebrated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jim Newcomer, Executive Pastor,  Colonial Baptist Church, VA Beach, VA  and Biblical Counseling Professor,  Virginia Beach Theological Seminary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is both a delightful gift and an insightful counselor; it brings us genuine joy and much needed wisdom. Sherry Millers discipleship workbook is a valuable guide to help us explore the Scriptures in order to grow together in passion and insight. &lt;/p&gt;
