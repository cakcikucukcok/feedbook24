  <title>The Calling from God - Lowell Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Calling from God shares an in-depth analysis of various callings to individuals to preach from a Biblical standpoint. It comes in unique ways for each individual. So, the exact nature of the calling from God is difficult, at best, to describe for it does not lend itself to any private interpretation, especially to someone not privy to the calling.
Within the text, the reader will learn about the struggles of various people with God and within themselves. All experiences are coercing, demanding, and cajoling for sure. However, the one called has to determine within oneself what Gods will is for him/herself.
The Calling from God will serve as a guide to those seeking answers about their possible destiny. The book takes the approach that many are called, only a few answers because of uncertainty. The book will help one decide what to do based on their life-changing experiences with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ. The ones called must make sure of their calling, for there is much to do for the harvest is great. This book shows in detail some of the preparation needed as one grows in service to the calling from God.
All Christians are called by God the Father to be witnesses of His resurrection power by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. For sure, a call in in any form lays a heavenly claim upon the one called. This book helps one understand the calling from God, and will help one to reach a sound decision based on their life and experiences in comparison to selected Biblical callings.
The Calling from God will serve a reference manual and a valuable source of information for anyone thinking about answering or has answered the call from God. The decision to serve is very personal as you will learn from the book The Calling from God and the many Biblical 
If you are struggling with the decision to serve of not to serve, this book is for you. Many are called, only few are chosen. You will know after reading The Call from God if you one of the few chosen to serve and trust Gods wisdom in leading you to point others to the Uplifted Christ.
Will you answer the call from God? The alternative is to wrestle with the Spirit, as conviction works slowly and agonizingly in the soul. This book is a must read." />
