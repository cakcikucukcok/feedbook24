  <title>The Messianic View of the Kingdom of God - Joseph O. Esin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Messianic View of the Kingdom of God&lt;/i&gt; offers persevering readers an assurance of secured miraculous healing, forgiveness, rewarding prayers, repentance, peace, and unity in the kingdom of God under the Leadership of Jesus Christ, our divine shepherd. It also presents an organized and systematic paradigm of the analysis of St. Lukes theology and all the New and Old Testament biblical prophesies about the restoration of the promised covenant. The book belongs in the libraries of clergies and seminarians; in departments of theology, philosophy, and moral studies; and in the hands of individuals seeking in-depth knowledge of Gods promise to all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
The book also affirms that the mission of Jesus Christ as the heavenly leader is to restore an unwavering benchmark for peace and unity to those who invest their trust in God. The restored covenant will put an end to all intentional and inadvertent disobedience to the teachings of Jesus Christ. The goal of &lt;i&gt;The Messianic View of the Kingdom of God&lt;/i&gt; is to enhance an enduring end to defiant human conduct and allow an opportunity to receive the glory that is guaranteed to everyone by the Almighty God through His son Jesus Christthe fountain of a secured irreversible healing, peace, and unity for everyone, all nations and the world communities. The majority of setbacks and temptations should be viewed as a consecrated revelation from God to redirect our paths in life, purify our bodies and souls, and reinforce our trust, and faith in Him, and to serve as a divine corridor to bring everyone closer to the promised kingdom of God under the leadership of Jesus Christ." />
