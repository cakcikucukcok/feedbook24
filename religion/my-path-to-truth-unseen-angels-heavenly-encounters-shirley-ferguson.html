  <title>My Path to Truth / Unseen Angels Heavenly Encounters - Shirley Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In My Path to Truth, you will share in the events and questionings of Fergusons life that brought her to a specific point where she met spiritual truth and wholly embraced it. Her journey is a confirmation of Gods Word, declaring that those who seek him shall find him and those who hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scripture tells us that Gods sheep will hear his voice. Many of us question how we are to hear the voice of God. In the second part of this story, Unseen Angels Heavenly Encounters, Ferguson shares how she has heard from God. This story may just give you greater insight and provide the faith that God desires to speak with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let God prove to you that he is no respecter of persons. O taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man that trusteth in him (Psalm 34:8, KJV).&lt;/p&gt;" />
