  <title>The Gospel Is a Children&#39;s Story - Elliot Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rediscovering the simplicity of the greatest story ever told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus never intended His gospel message to be difficult to grasp. He preached to the little children, and they understood what the learned of religious law completely missed: God gave His only begotten Son to love and redeem lost humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Gospel is a Childrens Story, E. Alexander returns to the raw truth of Jesuss message. Jesus isnt just a guy in a book; he is real, relevant, and concerned with every detail of your life. Completely God, yet no stranger to the human plight, Jesus suffered, died, and rose again so He could spend forever with those called to be Gods kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told with wisdom and humour, The Gospel is a Childrens Story is a must read for anyone who longs to encounter the Jesus who is full of joy and acceptance, who lets us cry on His shoulder, and takes the mess of our lives and turns it into something beautiful. Discover afresh the joyous, fulfilling simplicity of the gospel. Enter the adventure of The Gospel is a Childrens Story and be set on fire to share the excitement of this message with your world. It is time that we all return to the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I praise you Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure...I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 11:2526 and Mark 10:15&lt;/p&gt;" />
