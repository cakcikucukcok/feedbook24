  <title>Can God Come Out To Play?: Liturgy Ceremony Ritual - Sally Armour Wotton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Liturgy is not a religious frill or Sunday morning ceremonial exercise. It is a communal response to the sacred.  The liturgies, ceremonies, and rituals in our lives are the stuff of reality and have the power to heal and inspire us. From archaic times they have had this capacity, as they have always been our interaction with God and the gods.  This book is filled with essays and stories, ancient and modern. Some of its liturgies are tried and proven, creative, ecumenical services of worship and others are nonreligious, spirit-filled events. Can God Come Out To Play? is aimed at those who are looking for a spiritual approach to today&#39;s challenges and are interested in imaginative forms and methods to guide them. Educators, clergy, divinity students, event facilitators, care workers, and environmentalists will appreciate this book as a valuable resource. And all its readers will have one thing in common--a willingness to recognize God as their mysterious, playful companion." />
