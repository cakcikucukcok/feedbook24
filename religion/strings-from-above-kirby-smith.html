  <title>Strings from Above - Kirby Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The words you have one year to live had an impact on author Kirby Smith and changed the way she lived her life. At the age of twenty-eight, she learned her mother, Nancy, would not survive her battle with breast cancer. In the days leading up to her mothers death, she and her family witnessed multiple spiritual events. Kirby and her family cared for her terminally ill mother until she passed away on October 13, 2012. 
In 2013, Kirbys sister was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma. Rochelle, a young mother and registered nurse, faced her diagnosis and treatment with faith and a positive attitude that mirrored Nancys grace during her own multiple diagnoses with cancer. Rochelle and Kirbys father, Les, stood by Nancys side during their thirty-three years of marriage and led their two daughters through the grieving process. His prayers for peace and comfort were answered both during and after Nancys passing. 
Some of the answers to their questions came from genetic testing, proactive health care, interaction with a spiritual medium, and signs from heaven. Some of their questions remain unanswered, but Kirby and her family know they will see how all of the pieces fit together at the end of their lives. 
As you read Strings from Above, you will walk through the journey with Kirby and her family as they experience happiness and sorrow. In their darkest of days, God never abandoned them; He continued to guide them through lifes trials and hardships. Their mothers light continues to shine, and they have been blessed beyond measure. They have learned to embrace Gods greatest blessings, and they are excited to invite others to see His great works and His constant love through their story." />
