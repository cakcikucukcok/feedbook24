  <title>The Faith - Charles W. Colson, Harold Fickett Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rightly understood and rightly communicated, the Christian faith is one of great joy. It is an invitation to God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom, where tears are replaced by laughter and longing hearts find their purpose and their home. This is the heart of the gospel: God&amp;rsquo;s search to reclaim us and love us as his own. But have we truly grasped this? Those of us who have disdained Christianity as a religion of bigotry&amp;mdash;have we repudiated the genuine article or merely demonstrated our own prejudice and ignorance? Those of us who are Christians&amp;mdash;have we deeply apprehended the mission of Jesus, and do our ways and character faithfully reflect his beauty? From the nature of God, to the human condition, to the work of Jesus, to God&amp;rsquo;s coming kingdom, and all that lies between, how well do we understand the foundational truths of Christianity and their implications? The Faith is a book for our troubled times and for decades to come, for Christians and non-Christians alike. It is the most important book Chuck Colson and Harold Fickett have ever written: a thought-provoking, soul-searching, and powerful manifesto of the great, historical central truths of Christianity that have sustained believers through the centuries. Brought to immediacy with vivid, true stories, here is what Christianity is really about and why it is a religion of hope, redemption, and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
