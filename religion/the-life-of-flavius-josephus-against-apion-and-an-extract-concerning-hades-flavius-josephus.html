  <title>The Life of Flavius Josephus, Against Apion, and An Extract Concerning Hades - Flavius Josephus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within this collection of Josephus&#39; shorter works, the life and thoughts of this first-century Jewish historian and Roman citizen unfold in an informative, methodical way. The autobiography, &quot;The Life,&quot; is a text originally thought to have been an appendix to his most well-known work, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews,&quot; for Josephus felt the need to justify his cooperation with the Romans as a Jew just after the First Jewish-Roman War. In the two-volume &quot;Against Apion,&quot; Josephus defends Judaism as both an ancient religion and a philosophy, particularly in contrast to the more recent customs of the Greeks, or Greco-Romans. He addresses both negative contentions by the Greek writer Apion and myths of Manetho. Finally, Josephus&#39; &quot;Discourse to the Greeks&quot; includes his thoughts on the afterlife in opposition to the prevailing Greek views of his day. An insightful and observant writer, Josephus&#39;s unique position as a Jew in the Roman world of the first century provides a surprising perspective to a time generally studied through the lens of Christianity." />
