  <title>All About Heaven - Gregory Young Teter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do you believe in? Is God a part of your life? Are you happy with how your life is going? This book is a small part of the authors life and how he has made his life joyous. Content with what God has given him and sharing how he sees the world through nature, the author hopes to inspire you to share the best of your life with others too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope (Romans 15:4).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Relating everyday occurrences in the world around us and some uncommon observations of birds to biblical passages, the author has made a life germane to the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is filled with quick references to inspirational wisdom. Let this book be a guide to strengthen your faith, give you fresh hope, and help your love grow, grow, grow!&lt;/p&gt;" />
