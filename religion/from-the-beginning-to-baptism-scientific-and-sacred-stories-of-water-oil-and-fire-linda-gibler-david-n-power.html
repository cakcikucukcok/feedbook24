  <title>From the Beginning to Baptism: Scientific and Sacred Stories of Water, Oil, and Fire - Linda Gibler, David N. Power</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;From the Beginning to Baptism,&lt;/i&gt; Linda Gibler takes readers on a journey &#39;from the depths of space and the beginning of time through sacred Scripture and church history &#39;to discover the origins and creative power of water, oil, and fire. She traces the lives of those elemental entities through their cosmic history, to the point at which they are poured over the head and light the way of one being baptized. These elemental sources of al life are the substances through which new life in Christ begins in the sacrament of baptism. The journey through space and time, through the birth of the Universe and of life, and Gibler&#39;s reflections on this drama, help readers to enter into the cosmocentric spirituality&quot; at the heart of al things. No one who reads this book will ever again look at a drop of water, an olive, or a candle with the same eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Linda Gibler, PhD, a Houston Dominican Sister, is currently associate academic dean at the Oblate School of Theology in San Antonio, Texas. She has several years &#39; experience as a parish minister and is the science editor and a contributing author for the Collins Foundation Press, which hosts conferences on the significance of recent scientific revelations for faith, meaning, and the well-being of Earth and al her species.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
