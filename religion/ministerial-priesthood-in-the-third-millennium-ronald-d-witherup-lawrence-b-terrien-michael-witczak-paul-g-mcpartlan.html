  <title>Ministerial Priesthood in the Third Millennium - Ronald D. Witherup, Lawrence B. Terrien, Michael Witczak, Paul G. McPartlan...</title>

The religious Christmas has changed over the centuries and, contrary to many critics, is thriving today. This brief, accessible account will explain that:&lt;br&gt; &lt;ul&gt;The first Christians did not celebrate Christmas at al. The earliest mention of the feast occurs in the fourth century. In the Middle Ages Christmas moved into northern Europe where it became a major winter festival, competing with the pagan Yule. During the sixteenth century some Christians objected to Christmas because they claimed it had no biblical foundation. In England and New England the Puritans made it a crime to celebrate it! The modern secular Christmas arose in the nineteenth century, but the religious Christmas continued to grow in popularity and meshed well with the developing emphasis on Christmas as a day for family and friends.
