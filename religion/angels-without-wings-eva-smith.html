        &quot;Angels Without Wings&quot; consists of four facinating stories of ordinary people who found themselves in desparate situations and in need of a miracle. At
        the point of utmost desparation... the point when they thought that all hope was gone.. the point where only a supernatural occurrance could succor
        them, they suddenly found themselves in the presence of strangers who miraclously appeared, removed the threat from their circumstance and disappeared
        just as quickly as they had appeared, never to be seen again. &quot;Angels Without Wings&quot; is a book which provides &quot;proof positive&quot; that there are in fact,
        Heavenly Beings sent by God, who quietly walk amoung us, and surface when the need arises.
