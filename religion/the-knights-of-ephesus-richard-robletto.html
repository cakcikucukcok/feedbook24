  <title>The Knights of Ephesus - Richard Robletto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 6:10-11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont be fooled! Christians are in a spiritual battle. The world may ridicule the notion of a spiritual realm, but Christians know that it is both real and potent. As the last days draw ever closer, we need a deeper understanding of this to help us prepare for the great battles that lie ahead for believers. In the Bible, the book of Ephesians gives the clearest definition of the spiritual war we face; author Rich Robletto has written The Knights of Ephesus to offer readers fresh perspective and profound insight on how we are to put on the whole armour of God as he describes the nature of our struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed extensively by appropriate, relevant passages from the Bible, Robletto reminds Christians that Satan is real. He cautions that unless we fully grasp what our role is, along with the fact that Jesus Christ has given us all we need to withstand and ultimately triumph over evil, we will be woefully underprepared and overwhelmed by Satans wiles. The Knights of Ephesus effectively highlights the great insight provided by the book of Ephesians and offers instruction on how to prepare for war and how we are to achieve victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
