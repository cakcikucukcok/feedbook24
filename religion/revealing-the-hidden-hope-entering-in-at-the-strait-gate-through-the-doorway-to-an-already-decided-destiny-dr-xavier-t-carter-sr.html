  <title>Revealing the Hidden Hope: Entering in at the Strait Gate, Through the Doorway to an Already Decided Destiny - Dr. Xavier T. Carter Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Reverend Dr. Xavier Trone Carter, Sr.
During his last thirty-eight years of practicing preachingthirty-one of them as a pastor in preparationDr. Carter has striven to manifest the Incarnate Word by the spoken word, from the written word.   In those years he joined with some of the greatest and most courageous preachers of our time who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of truth over tradition, good over evil and salvation over sin.  However, unlike his predecessors, Dr. Carter, a brilliant Educator, Author, Pastor and Teacher, made the decisive-decision to take traditional Christian practices to the next level.  His theories have provoked controversy in the local Church for well over thirty years.  With the publishing of Revealing the Hidden Hope: Entering in at the Strait Gate, Through the Doorway to an Already Decided Destiny he now seeks to alter the course of human events in Christendom by painting a literal portrait of what it means to apprehend and adhere to the Principles of God, with the full expectation of enjoying the Promises of God, while we yet live.  
						                          James Francis Brooks, Senior Pastor 
						           Lily Baptist Church, Tarrant City, Alabama
By precept and example this book is a literal road map of how to get from where you are to where you desire to go; that is from earths sorrow to heavens joy, while you yet live.  Dr. Carter has pulled no punches: he calls a spade a spade and sin by its right name, letting the chips fall where they may.  By following his directions any believer can apprehend and adhere to the Divine Order of Authority in this world and subsequently enjoy the promises of God.  Its all a matter of belief plus action, commonly known as faith.
