  <title>The Greatness of God - Charles Frank Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With each passing day, our world seems to drift further and further away from the God of the Bible, divine creation, and Christian belief. This societal shift toward postmodernism and secularism is not a new development, however; the expanding and intensifying revolt against the biblical God and Christianity traces its roots back to the modern philosophies of the Enlightenment and Romanticism, which have given rise to many divergent views during the past three centuries, and become even more extreme in recent postmodernism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Greatness of God: How God Is the Foundation of All Reality, Truth, Love, Goodness, Beauty, and Purpose &lt;/em&gt;stands as an intellectual counterweight to the prevailing winds of a secular postmodern world. Author Charles Frank Thompson argues that the consequences of this rejection of God and divine creation have not been benign. He traces the modern revolution in detail and describes its deleterious consequences, including the loss of the ultimate basis for universal truth, knowledge, meaning, and purpose. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Greatness of God&lt;/em&gt;, Thompson explores a wide range of topics, including Christian theology, metaphysical philosophy, and an analysis of modern thought and art. He examines the rich history of Christian poetry, prose, and art and takes a look at recent scientific discoveries that help us understand Christian teachings about Gods creation. He concludes with an exploration of the millennium, the eternal kingdom of God, and the spiritual state of America and Europe today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
