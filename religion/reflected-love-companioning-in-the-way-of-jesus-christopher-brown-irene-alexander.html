  <title>Reflected Love: Companioning in the Way of Jesus - Christopher Brown, Irene Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By bringing four contemporary companioning narratives into dialogue with gospel descriptions of Jesus&#39; encounters with people, this book demonstrates how wonderfully diverse interpersonal ministry--pastoral care, counselling, chaplaincy, mentoring, spiritual companioning, and spiritual direction--is active participation in his shepherding, healing, restorative, and guiding purposes. Jesus&#39; invitation, as the true shepherd, master guide, and companion, is to embody and reflect his humble, life-giving, and restorative dynamic. With the essence of his way encapsulated in the words, Come unto me (Matt 11:28-30), and gospel accounts opening to us his person and his interpersonal dynamic, we are invited and gifted to offer to pilgrims profound respect as persons created in the likeness of God; the accompaniment of a gentle and humble heart; welcoming and sacred spaces; relational solidarity; creative and often non-directive entry points into the deeper rhythms and flows of their human experience (noting Jesus&#39; use of metaphor, imagery, enlivened imagination, parable, paradox, wakefulness, and attentiveness to the everyday); and, the prayerful attentiveness that will guide them to find rest for their souls. The encouragement is to get on the road with this master guide-companion and experience his kingdom breaking through, in, and around the lives of pilgrims and their companions." />
