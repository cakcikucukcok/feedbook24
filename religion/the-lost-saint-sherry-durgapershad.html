  <title>The Lost Saint - Sherry Durgapershad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do you know about love? A question that has had many answers but with little justification. But the worlds first documented love came from the roots of Christianity. This book is the untold story of lord Jesus Christ and his saviour, his purity, his purpose, his love Saint Mary Magdalene. An epic poetic display of a womans valour and resolve, poetic brilliance and spiritually humbling. This book is a play on words as you have never seen before. A condemned love story vindicated by the grace of art and poetry. This book preserves the legacy of the bravest woman the world will ever know. A never before told journey, written with the spirit of the Lord and his love as a guide. This book will detail love for the beauty it is and serve as a reminder that love...true love is always victorious." />
