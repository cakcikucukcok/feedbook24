  <title>The Bible and Bob Marley: Half the Story Has Never Been Told - Dean MacNeil, Stephen Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With a Bible and guitar, Bob Marley set out to conquer the world of popular music. Rising from humble origins to international stardom, he worked tirelessly to spread a dual message of resistance and redemption--a message inspired by his reading of scripture. Marley&#39;s constant reliance on the Bible throughout the stages of his artistic and spiritual paths is an integral part of his story that has not been sufficiently told--until now.  This is the first book written on Bob Marley as biblical interpreter. It answers the question, What light does biblical scholarship shed on Marley&#39;s interpretation, and what can Marley teach biblical scholars?  Focusing on the parts of the Bible that Marley quotes most often in his lyrics, MacNeil provides a close analysis of Marley&#39;s interpretation. For students of Marley, this affords a deeper appreciation and understanding of his thought and his art. For students of scripture, it demonstrates the nature of Marley&#39;s unique contribution to the field of biblical interpretation, which can be appreciated as an excellent example of what R. S. Sugirtharajah calls vernacular interpretation of scripture." />
