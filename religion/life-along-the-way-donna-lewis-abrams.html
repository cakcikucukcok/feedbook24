  <title>Life Along the Way - Donna Lewis Abrams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life Along the Way is a collection of insights the Lord opened up to me as I walked with Him daily. I love reading the scriptures. I believe the Holy Spirit speaks to us about Jesus through the scriptures. If you want to know Him, read them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As I posted excerpts from these writings on Facebook, I received positive feedback. I did not want to face the Lord one day and have to explain to Him why I had taken what He had given me and just buried it in the dirt. (Matthew 25:18). So here it is, Life Along the Way. Whatever is of Him will not return void. Whatever is of me, may He blow away as useless, for it surely is. To God be the glory, for only He can give life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
