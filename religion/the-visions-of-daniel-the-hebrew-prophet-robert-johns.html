  <title>The Visions of Daniel the Hebrew Prophet - Robert Johns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For centuries, controversy has raged over the authorship and
genuineness of the book of Daniel. Is it an authentic document
from the sixth century before the Common Era with a message
from God to postexilic Israel; or is it a forged document written
centuries later to encourage Israelites being oppressed by the
Seleucid king, Antiochus Epiphanes? Robert Johns addresses
these issues and more in his thesis on Daniels visions. Importantly,
Johns establishes when Daniel was provided with his visions,
and he defines why God provided Daniel with the visions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Visions of Daniel the Hebrew Prophet examines the metal
image, the beast with eleven horns, the Seventy sevens, chapter
eights little-horn, and the 2,300 evening-mornings. It demonstrates
that the enigmatic 1,290 days and 1,335 days are anything but
enigmatic, and it identifies the reason why Daniels fifth and final
revelation is so detailed. Appendices address issues of general
nature, such as the historicity of Jesus the Christ, the popularity of
dispensationalism, the identity of the abomination that desolates,
and the integrity of novels representing the Christian-fiction genre
(which focus on a seven-year tribulation period at the end of history).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will be of value to every Christian who has
an interest in Bible prophecy and eschatology.&lt;/p&gt;" />
