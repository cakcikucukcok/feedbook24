  <title>Lighthouses - Dean Alan Eaton, Paul Whetham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A game changer in local mission. There are already a number of useful resources in the Christian marketplace that teach you how to engage with people who are open to Christianity, even if only tentatively. &lt;em&gt;Lighthouses: Christian Coaching &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;in a Post-Christian World &lt;/em&gt;offers something fresh and different; it presents a model for engaging with people who are barely curious about the gospel or even openly resistant to it. Evangelist and church planter Dean Eaton has teamed up with Christian clinical psychologist Dr. Paul Whetham to propose a fresh approach to gospel-sharing based on a coaching model. &lt;em&gt;Lighthouses: Christian &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coaching in a Post-Christian World &lt;/em&gt;explains how to engage people in a &amp;lsquo;wellbeing conversation&amp;rsquo; that leads naturally to an exploration of their identity in God. The book draws heavily on materials developed by Dr. Whetham for Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; (www.soulfood.cafe), an online resource centre for contemporary gospel-sharers. The basic idea is that by transforming community meeting places and church cafes into informal sacred spaces where people &amp;lsquo;do life together&amp;rsquo;, you can embark on the search for meaning and give voice to the deeper things of the soul. &lt;em&gt;Lighthouses: Christian Coaching in a Post-Christian World &lt;/em&gt;is highly recommended for people looking for a fresh approach to mission and evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
