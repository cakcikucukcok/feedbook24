  <title>You Are Rich - Elaine Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Does the stress and worry of everyday life seem to defeat you from time to time?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You Are Rich is an exciting exposition of the power, dominion and authority that God has vested in you. This book will help you change your perception of who you are and who you were created to be.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Elaine Patterson will help you recognize how powerful your words are and teach you to be selective of what you say, knowing that you are either building or destroying your future. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Learn to speak words that bless, heal, prosper and uplift so you can reach and achieve your highest potential.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You Are Rich will help you learn to take time each day to relax, let go of negative experiences, and confess positive, uplifting words that will build you up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you take time to know who you are in Christ and use your God-given gifts of dominion and authority, you will reap His best and embrace the thought that You Are Rich! &lt;/P&gt;" />
