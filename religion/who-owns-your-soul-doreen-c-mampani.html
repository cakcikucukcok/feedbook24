  <title>Who Owns Your Soul? - Doreen C. Mampani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our Lord Jesus Christ asked this questions which is so relevant today when people do not hesitate to sell their souls to Satan for wealth, fame, power, beauty, and control over others (witchcraft).   Matthew 16:26 &quot;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?  or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  Our Lord Jesus Christ asked me this question and I cried for few days.  This time (2011) my husband and I lost almost everything from a comfortable life to a life of debts, poverty, shame, suicidal thoughts, mockery, no food, name calling, some confessing Christians called me a demon, Satan, witch, and all offending names you can imagine.  Choosing to follow Lord Jesus Christ is choosing life.  I chose Lord Jesus Christ not for wealth, fame, power, possession or material but because I need Him, my soul just cannot do without its Master.
The book you are about to read is based on my life story of how Satan is deceiving people.  The idea of writing this book was after discussing my background and experience with various people from different backgrounds, race, colour and gender both from South Africa and Africa.  I believe in Jesus Christ with all my heart, body and soul.This is a battle plan to destroy and dispossess death, poverty and destruction in Africa and the world. 
You may ask why Satan is so much after souls (human beings). That is because that has been his aim since his fall.  Who does your soul belong to?  All souls (humans) belong to God of Heaven.  With my background when I pray I say &quot;God of Heaven&quot;, Jesus Christ, I have to be specific due to the kind of challenges I experience when I pray.   When I prayed and said God, Satan would challenge and asked &quot;which one do you refer to?  In this book I will discuss witchcraft I experienced.
Witchcraft has been there since Old Testament time.  We read scriptures such Nahum 3:4 &quot;Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts&quot;.  In the New Testament for example we read in Acts 8:9 &quot;But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one&quot; 
I will give as much details as possible to help the reader to identify arrears that the enemy is controlling your own life so that you can pray or have a Pastor to pray for you for God Almighty to destroy the strongholds of Satan.  We are living in times when people are daring to oppose God Almighty publicly without fear.  Does God not hear or see?  Oh He does.  Why do we challenge such a loving caring God of Heaven who created us in His own image with so much unconditional love?  It&#39;s because of rebellion towards our Maker, one of Satan&#39;s goals against the Almighty God.  Satan hated human beings since the creating of Adam and Eve.   His aim since then has been to turn human beings against our Creator.  He tries to make God appear unfair he said in Gen 3:4-5 &quot;then the serpent said to the woman, you will not surely die ... for God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil&quot;.  Satan made it appear as if God was depriving Adam and Eve from being like God, from knowing good and evil.  Today Satan still uses his tricks to deceive people to want to be like God.  Promising that he can give power, control, wealth, fame, beauty, access to everything that the individual desire.  He does not tell the person though that he (Satan) takes the soul in exchange of these things.  
I don&#39;t want to be associated with Satan neither any of his demons, principalities and powers.  I love Lord Jesus Christ with my entire being.  
I will mention some of the numbers used by Satan, especially number 11.   Remember is God of Heaven who created days, weeks, months and years and numbers not Satan.  Sata" />
