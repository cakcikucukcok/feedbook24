  <title>Birthing to the Workings - Dr. Shirley Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All things in life are about birthing. Concepts, viewpoints, and even religious doctrine go through a process of birthing. In &lt;i&gt;Birthing to the Workings,&lt;/i&gt; author Shirley Johnson examines the effect of the church leaving its Hebraic roots. In this informative analysis, Johnson places key emphasis on the effect this had on teachings related to the Godhead, Trinity, and Pentecost. 
Packed with credible resources and buoyed by thorough research, this examination provides revelations and truths relating to Godhead perspectives and Hebraic viewpoint. It illustrates the following points:
	The Hebraic believers emphasized the cohesiveness of the whole God versus the singleness of the one person.
	The Father, and at times the spirit, have become supporting actors, with Yeshua stealing the show.
	The first apostolic believers of Yeshua believed in manifestations rather than persons. 
	Yeshua, the apostles, and the early church did not support the current Godhead doctrines as espoused by Western Christianity of today.
&lt;i&gt;Birthing to the Workings&lt;/i&gt; compares the birthing process of doctrine and the workings of the Holy Spirit to the birth of a child. The theological nature of birthing to workings is clarified as it relates to Christianity, the Trinity, and the Hebraic roots connection." />
