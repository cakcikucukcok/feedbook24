  <title>The Glory of the Lord God Almighty - Mary L. Hock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My husband and I were blessed to spend three months in Israel during the summer of the year 2000 where we experienced the presence of God in a powerful and awesome way. From this experience the Holy Spirit has inspired me to write this book about His Glory. In this book you will learn how to enter into the presence of the Lord and how to abide and stay there. I will share with you how God demonstrates His glory through what He has created, and you will learn how it is possible to stand and receive divine revelation in His presence. In the last chapter of this book you will learn all about Jesus, the King of Glory! After all, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is the King of Glory, and its all about Him. My pastor at The Potters House Church of God in Columbus, Ohio, has instilled in me a great love and hunger for the Word of God, so this book on the Glory of God contains many Scripture verses to support my thoughts. I thank the Lord for the opportunity to share it with all of you. I hope and pray that you enjoy it, grow from it, and get closer to God through it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
