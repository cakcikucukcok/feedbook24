  <title>The Deity Formerly Known as God - Jarrett Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“I do not want my image of God. I want God.”—C. S. LewisLike Lewis, Jarrett Stevens wants to truly know and experience God, not some distorted and destructive image of the Almighty formed over the years. With wry humor and profound insights, Stevens searches to align his broken images of God with the images of God found in the Bible. Attempting to recapture the spirit of J. B. Phillips’ classic, Your God Is Too Small, Stevens addresses various assumptions we have about God and sorts through twelve different views of God—six destructive and six constructive. God is not, for instance, the cop around the corner waiting to catch you breaking the law. Neither is he a talent show judge, wincing as you struggle through life. What if those destructive images we’ve shaped were replaced with more positive ones—a neighbor you can call for help in the dead of night … or a tired-eyed father waiting for his child to return home safely? These images come straight from Jesus’ teachings and invite us into a new experience with the true and living God." />
