  <title>Those Who Choose to Be Chosen - Virginia A. Ashmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Those Who Choose to be Chosen&lt;/I&gt; offers thought-provoking,
inspirational lessons that encourage anyone on a spiritual journey
to focus on awakening their divine life mission.&lt;p&gt;
At a young age, Virginia Ashmore&#39;s practicing religion prohibited
her from attending a friend&#39;s church. In her young mind, she
reasoned that her friend, and the members of her friend&#39;s church,
must have prayed to a different God than the God she
worshipped. That significant impression launched Ms. Ashmore
on a life-long pilgrimage in search of her own divine destiny. She
points out that we are all made in the likeness of God and must
carve out our individuality when contributing to the overall
collective consciousness of the world. After years of study, her
personal reflections have developed into lessons that will teach
you how to:
 See yourself the way God sees you
 Open your heart and find the gift of love
 Discover who you were intended to be
 Use prayer to open the door to God&#39;s work
Through Ms. Ashmore&#39;s teachings, you will learn that you are not
alone. Open your eyes so you can truly experience all you are
intended to see, feel, and love through the glory of God.&lt;p&gt;" />
