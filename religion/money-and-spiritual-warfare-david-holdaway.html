  <title>Money and Spiritual Warfare - David Holdaway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Bible has a great deal to say about spiritual warfare and also about money but what many do not realise is how closely these are related. When you read through the Gospels and the Book of Acts you discover how often money and spiritual conflict are connected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Often times, the greatest opposition to the spread of the Gospel came not from the political or religious authorities but from the financial quarter.&lt;br /&gt;
If money has control over our lives, we become ineffective and untrustworthy in God&amp;rsquo;s purposes. When money is our master then we will never experience all God has for us. A truly biblical understanding of money and wealth can be summed up by:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; You cannot serve God and money but you can serve God with it.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; We are not to serve money but rather money is to serve us.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Wealth and wealthier does not equal prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Biblical prosperity is about our quality of life more than our standard of living&lt;br /&gt;
Understanding and applying these truths is life changing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topics that are covered in the book include:&lt;br /&gt;
How Much Can God Trust You?&lt;br /&gt;
Money and Warfare&lt;br /&gt;
The Spiritual Powers Behind Money&lt;br /&gt;
Understanding the Power of Money&lt;br /&gt;
Gaining Power Over Money&lt;br /&gt;
Understanding God&amp;rsquo;s Economy&lt;br /&gt;
Breaking out of Poverty&lt;br /&gt;
Entering into God&amp;rsquo;s Prosperity&lt;br /&gt;
Financial Decisions and the Will of God&lt;br /&gt;
Eliminating Debt&lt;br /&gt;
Giving as an Act of Spiritual Warfare&lt;br /&gt;
Money and the End of the Age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Holdaway&amp;rsquo;s book explains and expounds the topics he covers with insight, humour and an easy to understand style that draws you in from the very start.
