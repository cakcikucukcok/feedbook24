  <title>Centurion Living - Dr. Justin Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you ever ask, &lt;br /&gt;&quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out what Scripture has to say about the answer to this question as you develop a strategic life plan that is centered on God&#39;s purpose and vision for your life. Learn to see your entire life and all the everyday things that you do as divine assignments given to you by God Himself. You may change your perspective on life and gain a whole new passion for living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin this process we must understand our origin. Where do we come from? Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? What (or who) defines our purpose? These are the most fundamental questions for a business to answer before creating a business plan, and they are the most fundamental, foundational knowledge that an individual must acquire and define before any meaningful plan for life can be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;The intent of this book is to be a guide to a stronger understanding of Gods purpose for you, and to apply this understanding to the defining of values and a vision for your life. In later chapters you will see how applying the foundation of purpose, values and vision through ALL of the missions in your life with a clear strategy that maintains focus on your original purpose, will help reveal Gods purpose for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to define their purpose in life people often state that they were meant to be an engineer, or accountant, or doctor, or clergymen, or parent, or whatever. Someone may be called to one of these specific missions, but a mission in life is different from lifes purpose.  A mission is a life role, or assignment Purpose is a fundamental meaning, or reason for being&lt;/p&gt;" />
