  <title>Pentecostal-Charismatic Prophecy - Samuel W. Muindi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Prophecy is a major theme both in Scripture and in Church doctrine. However, prophecy is seen by many as an ancient biblical phenomenon which is now redundant. There is, conversely, a form of prophecy that is very much alive in the Pentecostal-Charismatic wing of the Church. Although the Pentecostal-Charismatic tradition is billed as the fastest growing movement in Church history, it has received scant attention in Pentecostal Studies in terms of its focus on Charismatic Prophecy. This book is an attempt to explore the notion of &lt;EM&gt;charisms&lt;/EM&gt; of the Holy Spirit. It examines, from an empirical-theological perspective, the nature and significance of the phenomenon of Charismatic Prophecy as reportedly manifested in Pentecostal Charismatic liturgical settings in an African context.&lt;/P&gt;" />
