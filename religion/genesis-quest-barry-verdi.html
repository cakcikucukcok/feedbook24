  <title>Genesis Quest - Barry Verdi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are the stories in Genesis fact, myth, legend, the word of God, philosophy, or something else? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through time, what people think or remember about Genesis has become a mixture of fact and fable. For example, if you were to ask someone what fruit Adam and Eve were tempted by, most people might say, An apple. If you were to ask what color the apple was, most people might state that they think the fruit was red. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these actual facts? No, people are simply using artistic imagination. The stories in Genesis are multifaceted oral traditions about the human family that originated long before the established interpretations, dogmas, and doctrines of our contemporary world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the stories do indicate is that we are all genetically connected regardless of our outward appearance, yet we are divided due to multiple factors related to our situation in life and personal beliefs. The Genesis Quest examines ancient roots of human thinking to strip away veneers of progressive interpretations and reveal the evolution of a philosophy  six principles of the human spirit looking for the soul of our communal life: God/creation, good and evil, sharing, mercy, saving life, and communicating, These principles are intended to help us understand what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;" />
