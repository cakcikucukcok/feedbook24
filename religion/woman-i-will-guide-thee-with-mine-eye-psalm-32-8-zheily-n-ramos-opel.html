  <title>Woman:  “I Will Guide Thee with Mine Eye” Psalm 32:8 - Zheily N. Ramos-Opel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is dedicated to missionary women who carry the Word of Life as a lamp unto their feet. The Holy Spirit identifies them as disciples of Jesus Christ and daily they grow great in the grace and knowledge of the Word of Life and the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. Inspired by the love of Jesus Christ, they rise up every day to fight the good fight of the faith. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. (Luke 9:23). 
In this book, Jesus Christ invites all women who are called to be missionaries to walk with him in the holy gardens founded by His love in the Garden of Mercy, in the Holy of Holies; in the Garden of Grace, in the Place of the Most High; and in the Garden of Victory, in the Heavenly Place. In these three holy gardens, the missionary women learn how the Holy Spirit anchors the Faith of Jesus in them squarely in the finished work of the Cross of Christ. Moreover, they learn how to give the Word of Life and the testimony of Jesus, how to receive the love of God, and how to believe for and live lives full of power, triumphs and victories while maintaining their eyes fixed on The Lord Jesus Christ. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. (1 John 5:13).
