  <title>The True Understanding of the End-Times - Lance Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Book possesses some nuggets, sweet and delicious. There are several points raised that will leave some readers in awe. They will wonder if what they read is true or not. It will cause much introspection, analysis, new and different thought processes and much research. This is especially so with the points raised in the discussion of the timing of the rapture, the arrival of the antichrist on the world stage, and the order of the seals, trumpets and plagues of the book of Revelation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the explanation of Daniel 11, from verse 21-45, that I am quite sure many people will find enlightening. The area where the antichrist will arise is of much interest to Bible scholars, students and other historians. I have narrowed it down to Iraq, based on my extensive studies and from the understanding of the vision given to me by the Lord God. From my online friend, there is also the contribution of the pictorial route of the antichrist on his march to Jerusalem just prior to the mid-way point of the Week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this book holds many exciting new ideas for readers. Do not start the book with a pre-set mind, but rather open your mind for a new adventure. It is a must read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
