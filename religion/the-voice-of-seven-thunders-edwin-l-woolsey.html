  <title>The Voice of Seven Thunders - Edwin L. Woolsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our world is changing at a bewildering rate. Although the prophet Daniel lived during an age when technology was relatively simple, he foresaw a time on Earth when many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. (Daniel 12:4) How unlikely for a man, living 2,500 years ago, to foresee in his own ability a revelation that has been fulfilled within the last 200 years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those embracing the words of Dickens, the assumption could be made that these are the best of times, while anyone objecting to this premise might be judged to suffer from neo-millennium phobia. But undeniably, a darker shadow is being cast upon the stage of current events as the curtain rises one last time for the final act of Apocalypse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apocalypse, A prophecy in which events of a great cataclysm and the destruction of all evil forces are foretold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, 3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. Revelations 10:2-3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voice Of Seven Thunders is the end-time revealing of Gods hidden calendar for Earths greatest events from Creation to the Kingdom Age of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
