  <title>Rules for Our Walking With God - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Jeremiah Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jeremiah Burroughs (1599-1646), was a brilliant Reformed preacher and Westminster Divine.
Burroughs’ main text is, “And Enoch walked with God...” (Gen. 5:24). His main doctrine is that it is the great excellency and commendation of a godly man to walk with God.
He covers how a person is brought to walk with God shown in six particulars. Then he defines what it means to walk with God, and their extended excellencies, along with exhortations to both Christians and unbelievers as to their interest in walking with God. Then, he provides ten ways that show people how a man is walking with God, or not. Lastly, he demonstrates biblical “rules” toward walking with God in the right manner. The last chapter, worth its weight in gold, deals with Christians who feel as though God is hiding his face from them. 
This work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions." />
