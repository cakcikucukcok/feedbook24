  <title>Who Is Jesus to You? - Patrick Obeng Gyamera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He possessed neither wealth nor worldly influence. His relatives were inconspicuous, and had neither training nor formal education. He died and yet lives  He is fully divine and fully man; His divinity touches the Father in Heaven whiles His humanity touches our infirmities. He lived a sinless live in this sinful world. He is the greatest man this world has ever known. This book will introduce you to this young man called Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who was only 33 years on earth yet, changed the history of this world.
Who is this Jesus to you? Personally how do you perceive Him? Is He a Teacher, a Prophet, a Messenger, or a Saviour? This book in your hand may startle you about this Jesus. It will unveil and unearth everything you should know about this greatest gift heaven has sent to mankind. By the time you finish reading this book, you will understand why Jesus name is above every name and that by the mentioning of his name, every creature in heaven, on earth and under the earth must bow and worship Him. And why no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:3). This book will also enlighten you to appreciate why you should take Him as your Lord and Personal Saviour. God bless you." />
