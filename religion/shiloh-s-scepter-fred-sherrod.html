  <title>Shiloh’S Scepter - Fred Sherrod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Shilohs Scepter&lt;/i&gt; was to leave my descendants a clear, unequivocal message of hope and truth pointing them to the God who has sustained and blessed me since I was nine years old. A great challenge in this modern computer age is finding a way to peak peoples curiosity, especially young people, about what a centuries-old book has to say. I have struggled to present many of the basic biblical truths in an easy-to-read format interesting to all ages. In these pages you can find the basis for the confident beliefs and strong convictions responsible for shaping the essence of my being and guiding my choices in life. Many of the key themes of the Christian life are addressed in the thirty-nine chapters. These include the way to salvation, coping with sin, spiritual growth and responsibility, church life, prayer, faith, anxiety, happiness, depression, materialism, old age, death, and heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you own a Bible, you hold in your hand the very same scepter our Lord so deftly wielded against the enemy when tempted in the wilderness. This kingly wand, an awesome weapon and incomparable guide, will protect you from the evil one and keep you safe on your journey through life. But importantly, you must learn how to use the Word for it to be effective. Results achieved are commensurate with how well your powerful blade is brandished. If you find the time to read this book and it improves your Bible skills in any significant way, then my countless hours of writing will have been well spent. May these pages lead you humbly to the feet of Christ, enlighten your spiritual understanding, and challenge your commitment to Christian service!&lt;/p&gt;" />
