  <title>Christian Marriage - Dr. John Thomas Wylie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marriage and the family are God-given institutions, more established by hundreds of years than the church. It was God who founded marriage in the Garden of Eden when he said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make Him an help meet for him (Gen. 2:18). It was God who setteth the solitary in families (Psalm 68:6). 
The God of creation saw that the supporting power of humanity is in the family. Furthermore, in his intelligence, he put the way to the quality of the family in the relationship of marriage. Marriage is, in the Christian ideal, one man and one woman holding hands with each other and with God, forever. No other human relationship is so requesting or so fulfilling. 
There is a test in marriage to be discovered no place else. This relationship requests the best that a man and a woman can provide for it. All that each has of affection, comprehension, persistence, forgiveness, and a score of different graces are required. 
This is a great resource for the clergy and laypersons alike. All issues in this publication are from the Christian perspective with a biblical foundation. This publication not only covers issues pertaining to the Christian marriage (primarily a divine institution), but it also pertains to issues of marital counseling, family, the childrens reverence and obedience to parents, the parents mutual love and affection for each other and their children, worship in the home, and last but not the least, the chief design of the state or civil government. 
Jesus said, Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness (Matt. 6:33). When husband and wife obey this command and teach their children to obey it, families have a future that is eternal and that fadeth not away." />
