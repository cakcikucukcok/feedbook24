  <title>The Fundamentals of Christianity - K.V. Anglin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God initially gave His Word to earth by way of the Jewish community, so that Jewish culture could be reflected in his Word throughout the world (rom. 3:1-2). This results in their translation of the Bible being the closest to his intention for mankind. For that reason I use The Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) as my text for this manuscript.
CHRISTIANITY
Christianity is not a religion. It is that type of being wherein the life of Jesus Christ is portrayed in and through the life of another person. It originates from the term Christ, which means The Anointed. Originally, Christ Jesus was the image of God&#39;s person (Heb.l:3), but was now anointed to carry out two missions. 1) To become the prototype for man, and 2) to bring man into conformity to his own person, thus making man the image of God (Rom.8:28-30).
The process of redemption effects in man the transformation that renders him a new creature (2Cor.5:14-21; GaI.2:19-20). Redemption is possible only through faith in the shed blood of Christ. Having gone through this process one becomes a Christian and his lifestyle is Christianity. It is therefore not a religion but it supersedes religion." />
