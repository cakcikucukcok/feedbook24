  <title>Holy Eucharist: the Beauty of Catholicism and the Glory and Essence of the Catholic Priesthood;     the Scandal of Its Abuses - Christopher Ezeh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1.	The celebration of the Holy Eucharist and the development of the Eucharistic adoration in the Catholic Church are explored to harvest the rich insights and contributions of the saints, sacred theologians of the Church, the Popes and a host of others including the laity ad the clergy through their sacred writings and exemplary pious devotions to the Blessed Sacrament.
2.	The Holy Eucharist is God in our midst. This book relates a number of miracles that individuals have received directly from the Eucharistic Lord by visiting the Blessed Sacrament or by participating in the Eucharistic adoration.
3.	The Holy Eucharist is a healing tool par excellence in the ministry of a Catholic priest. How the priest can deploy its healing resources in his daily ministrations to those who approach him with all kinds of problems, is fully explored in this book. The implications of what it means for the priest to engage himself and Gods people with visit to the Blessed Sacrament are fully developed in this publication.
4.	How can a Catholic priest access the healing resources in the Holy Eucharist and employ those healing resources in the healing of those who approach him with all kinds of life issues and problems which could be spiritual, moral, social, physical, material, mental, psychological, etc? That is part of what this book is all about.
What constitute the abuses of the Holy Eucharist? Could we still receive favors from the Eucharistic Jesus when we knowingly abuse the Holy Eucharist? In what ways do we abuse the Holy Eucharist thereby insulting the Eucharistic Jesus without knowing? These issues are dealt with in this book where the author identified and discussed some of the abuses of the Holy Eucharist. This book, therefore, is about how to visit the Blessed Sacrament and receive favors from the Eucharistic Lord and how to avoid abusing the Holy Eucharist.
5.	The Real Presence: Fact or FancyWhat Lies Concealed in the Sacred Host? Some classical Eucharistic miracles which took place through the centuries especially in the 20th, 13th and 9th centuries are narrated in this book to help unravel the hidden divinity in the Sacred Host after consecration." />
