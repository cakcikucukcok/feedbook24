  <title>In This Place with God - Felicia Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you know there is a secure place in God where you can find shelter and receive inner peace from the demands and expectations of life? To live in this world can sometimes seem overwhelming because there is so much to take in and consider on a daily basis. There are many opportunities to become frustrated and discouraged due to the stress and pressures of life that often come from family, work, relationships, and finances. This place in God is a constant shield from the many darts that are thrown at you. For the dart of rejection, loneliness, and low self-esteem, there is acceptance in this place with God. For the dart of betrayal and heartbreak, there is forgiveness in this place with God. For the dart of difficult times and impossible situations to overcome, there is victory in this place with God. For the dart of not knowing where you fit in or finding your mark in life, there is purpose in this place with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where you are and who you are with, you can stand securely in this place with God at all times. God is good and so full of love, grace, and mercy just for you. It does not matter what you are facing today  God is ever ready to be anything that you need. In this book, I want to take you on a personal journey through finding your place of acceptance, forgiveness, victory, and purpose. By the time that you finish reading this book, I want you to be determined that you will not let nothing and no one take you out of this place with God, including yourself . My prayer is that you will be encouraged in knowing that there is truly no better place to be than in this place with God. Be Blessed!!&lt;/p&gt;" />
