  <title>Meditations on Sufism - Arsalan Mozaffari Falarti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;You are all free and you are all responsible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Holy Quran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Sufism challenges humanity to review ourselves and our motives. Are we acting in ego for our own selfish benefit? Or are we acting for the good of our communitylocally and globally? Have we seriously considered the long-term effects of our decisions, and if so, are we capable of accepting those consequences? Are you truly grateful for what you have, or are you childishly dissatisfied with everything? What is the content of your heart?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Sufism not only puts the question to you but demands that you answer with sincerity, and once you have your heartfelt answer, accept that you are truly responsible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Sufism directs Darvishes to control their instincts and senses wisely using the knowledge held in their mind; the mind controlled and guided by the love radiated from their innocent and wise heart, the heart that is the temple of love, home for sincerity and place for corrections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Whatever faith you may follow, whatever name you have for God, Sufism does not ask that you abandon your existing personal relationship with Our Creator and follow a different path. Sufism asks that you be authentic, sincere, and honest with yourself. It is in living with heartfelt sincerity and integrity that your actions and interactions with Creation fill your heart with love, peace and an enduring sense of contentment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
