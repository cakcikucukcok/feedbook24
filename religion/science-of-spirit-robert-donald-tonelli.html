  <title>Science of Spirit - Robert Donald Tonelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beyond the Secret... Beyond the Power of Now... is the Science of Spirit...a Deeper look at life.
Why are we here alive on planet earth trapped in a life of 9 to 5 wage slavery? &quot;Science of Spirit: Lost Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth&quot; shows that all life on planet earth and in the universe is based on an evolution of consciousness from the beginning of timethe Big Bang. It clarifies the connectedness of all life with Science and to Spirit through the understanding of world-old Hermetic Teachings in a balance of Reason and Faith. Consciousness is the very fabric that all form is made out of and is the ground of all beingness of life Consciousness and the energy that makes up matter are inextricably combined or linked, emerging in a sequence of events called occasions of experience that ultimately create our experiences in life and our reality. The universe isnt made of things or particles. Its a process. Its made up of events. The result of this evolution of consciousness is an Analogical Awareness of life living in the now moment of unlimited potentials for the growth of a new super-conscious species of humanity moving through an Omega Point in time between 2011-- 2013. These Hermetic Teachings were clarified for me through the teaching of Ramtha and his Ancient Gnostic School much of what I have learned in 20 years my philosophy of life has its foundation in Ramthas philosophy. Our accelerating consciousness is moving to a quantum existence of Spirit-in-Mass God  Man realized alive with all the lower species of life specifically the Sheeple of Economic Western Society.
The Science of Spirit is based on my personal experience... my research... and my understanding of the ancient philosophy that this work comes from... It uses from research the philosophy and experience of other very credible people that have studied different aspects of a Science of Spirit as a philosophy to live by... I use this eclectic approach to build an accurate model of reality based in consciousness that allows us to create our own reality once we rid ourselves of the illusions of society. This approach gives credibility to my overall viewpoint a modern interpretation of a very old philosophy and way of life... A Science of Spirit that is inherent in Mother Nature...  It goes in-depth about understanding  What Consciousness Is! - An Analogical State of Awareness that is continuously evolving faster and faster to the eternal Now Moment  It uses the discovery of a new perspective of the Mayan Calendar that is supposed to end in a religious &quot;Apocalypse at &quot;The Omega Point&quot; in time around 2012 as its foundational understanding of an &quot;Evolution of Consciousness&quot; on earth.    This philosophy and research show an Evolution of Consciousness a rising of an Analogical Awareness of life revealing a Science to the nature of Spirit It explains from a new perspective, this battle between the &quot;Forces of Good and Evil&quot; at &quot;The End of Time&quot;. This Ancient Science of Spirit philosophy explains how the primeval forces of life [Spirit] that are inherent in Mother Earth growing for 16.4 billion years are pitted against the &quot;dogmatic, stagnant, god-fearing personalities,&quot; that runs the Engines of Commerce of our Global Society with their focus on monetary control of the people and the planet. This is a real life battle between evolving evolutionary beings against the &quot;Anti-Christ Social Consciousness of The Multi-National Corporations. Religious dogmas talk about an &quot;Apocalypse at the end of time&quot; to help warn us of our impending doom the remarkable thing is that the word &quot;Apocalypse&quot; means the &quot;lifting of a veil&quot; or a disclosure to certain privileged persons of something hidden from the majority of humankind. I will show in this book that the &quot;lifting of a veil&quot; is a rising of consciousness that knows no fear of the unknown and clarifies ancient predictions of the end days and the real battle of Armageddon.
