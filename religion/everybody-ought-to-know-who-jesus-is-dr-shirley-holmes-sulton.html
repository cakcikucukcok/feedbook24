  <title>Everybody Ought to Know Who Jesus Is - Dr. Shirley Holmes Sulton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God gave me this simple but powerful insight: Our word is our bond, Gods Word is His Son. God took His WORD and wrapped it into flesh, and the WORD became alive and dwelt among men (John 1:14). Jesus sacrificed his life so that we would have a right to the tree of life without using animals as a sacrificial offering. 
&lt;br&gt;
God made man several different ways; Adam was made from the dust of the earth, Eve was made with a rib from Adams side, Cain and Able were conceived through Adam and Eve, Jesus Christ is the Word of God, Gods Son was conceived through the Holy Spirit through the Virgin Mary. God wants us as His dear little children, which has been expressed throughout the Bible. We failed Him over and over again, so God sent us His Son to redeem us, His Word to receive us, His blood to wash us, and His Holy spirit to keep us. Gods Word has a powerful effect on our lives. We must meditate both day and night. Whatever you speak and practice is what you become. Moses told us in Deuteronomy 6:7-9, To teach Gods word diligently to our children, talk about it when we sit in our houses and walk by the way. When we rise up, bind them for a sign upon our hand and frontlets between our eyes. David stated, Thy Word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee. (Psalms 119:11)  Eliphaz stated in Job 22:22, Receive, I pray thee, the law from His mouth, and lay up his Words in your heart.
&lt;br&gt;
God is revealed throughout the scriptures  both He and His Son Jesus, from Genesis to Revelation. Many scriptures in the New Testament are repeated from the Old Testament.  For example, John the Forerunner of Christ can be found in Isaiah 40:3-5, the birth of Christ, Isaiah 7:14-16, and Christ as the Branch in Isaiah 4:2 and Jeremiah 33:14-15. We must read, listen and study Gods word as instructed in the Holy Scriptures. Subsequently, most of this book, Everybody Ought to Know Who Jesus Is, is written directly from the scriptures. 
&lt;br&gt;
May all of my brothers and sisters of the same faith and other religions be enlightened to our Father God, as He released Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit for us, to be inside of us as the three in one, all inside of God Himself.  Amen." />
