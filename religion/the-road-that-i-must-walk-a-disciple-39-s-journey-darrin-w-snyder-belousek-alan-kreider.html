  <title>The Road That I Must Walk: A Disciple&#39;s Journey - Darrin W.  Snyder Belousek, Alan  Kreider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How much of myself (and my stuff) must I give up to follow Jesus? How does belonging to a faith community shape being a Christian? How do I walk in faith with friends whose faith is unclear or uncertain? What gives Christians hope in the face of power politics? Can I be pro-life and decry war, too? How do I make peace amidst the wrongs of the world? If you wonder about such questions, this book is for you. The Road That I Must Walk represents the author&#39;s own wrestling with the call and cost of discipleship across a decade. Rather than an academic attempt to define or describe discipleship, these are simply the words of a disciple, one who has sought to walk in the way of Jesus. Arising from various circumstances and responding to various concerns, the several pieces collected here comprise a sketchbook of ethical reflections, biblical meditations, and spiritual ponderings drawn from one person&#39;s journey of following Jesus." />
