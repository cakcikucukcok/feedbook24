  <title>Ancient Poetry from Beyond My Years! - Larry J. Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS WRITINGS SOURCE IS THE SEVEN LAMPS OF FIRE BEFORE THE THRONE OF CREATION OF THE LORD JEHOVAH AND HIS BELOVED SON JESUS CHRIST! 
IT CONTAINS  REAL PICTURES FROM THE PAST, PRESENT, AND THE FUTURE! 
ALL THE GLORY GOES TO THE LORD JEHOVAH AND JESUS CHRIST.
I HAVE PRESENTED THE TRUE EVIDENCE OF EZEKIEL 1:13-16 KJV;
TRUE TIME CONTROL!
THE PICTURE IS THE WHEELS OF TIME AND LIGHTNING TRANSFERS.
I ALSO PRESENT THE LORD JEHOVAHS LIGHT COVERING WITH ME.
THE SCRIPTUAL REFENCE IS PSALMS 104: 1-2 KJV
I DID A ROUGH PAINTING AT THE CLOSE OF THIS WRITING OF JEHOVAH AND THIS PERSONAL SCRIBE WITH HIM THAT I HAVE PRESENTED TO THE WORLD.
IT IS MY BEST SHOT AT PAINTING AS A LITTLE CHILD FOR JEHOVAH AND CHRIST THE LORD.
THE SOURCE FOR THIS PAINTING IS FOUND IN PSALMS: 104:1-2 KJV ALSO. 
I AM A SON THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS TO JEHOVAH CREATOR MY FATHER.
YOU WILL FIND JEHOVAHS SCRIPTURES ABOUT ME  IN GALATIONS 4:1-8 KJV.
HE (JEHOVAH) WAS MY ONLY OVERSEER, TEACHER,  AND MENTOR. I WOULD NOT EXCEPT ANYONE ELSE THROUGH ALL TIME AND SPACE.  
MY PRAYER WAS ABBA FATHER RAISE ME UP THE CHILD PLEASING TO YOU TO BE AS YOU ARE IN CHRIST JESUS MY SAVIOR.
AS YOU ALL SEE THE LORD JEHOVAH ANSWERED MY PRAYER!
MY COVENANT IS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST JESUS CROSS.
(THE PICTURES ARE REAL)
THE GREAT I AM IS THE LORD JEHOVAH!,
HE WAS,
HE IS, 
AND HE SHALL EVER MORE BE!
In the grand scheme of creation and all existanceI see there are things thatyou do not understand.I have wrote with the heart within me, the belovedtrue creator of all the lord Jehovah. As you read you can feel and see the depth of the truth ringing deep within your souls.This expression of truth is to helpyou seehow beautiful things have been established and created in the heavens,and here on earth also.I hope your heart can feel how indetailed each pieceof creation is that envelopes eternity. Written within this ancient scribe is a beautiful love story of how father godcares for his people. It also births forth a hope for a new dawn in time and existance thatI feel we all are longing for. With much love and honorI submit to you writings from The past, The present, and The future.  Your beloved author: Larry J. Perry SR.
I AM  FOREVER!
