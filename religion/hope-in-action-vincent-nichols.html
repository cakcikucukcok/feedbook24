      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;‘Hope is not the product of opinion or argument . . . There has to be something else – an impetus to act, a vision, something that fires our imagination.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a time when many feel defeated by the world’s problems, Vincent Nichols reminds us why we need to hold on to hope – and how we can offer genuine hope to those who need it most. With questions for reflection at the end of each chapter, this stirring book will encourage people of all faith backgrounds to come together and work towards a better future for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘What makes us human? . . . What holds us together across cultures, religions, gender and many other differences? Cardinal Nichols’ answers are both deeply realistic and deeply hopeful.’&lt;br&gt;Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘This book . . . is an important call to action, and one that will encourage real-life transformation.’&lt;br&gt;Ben Cooley, Chief Executive, Hope for Justice&lt;/p&gt;" />
