  <title>Unbroken Cord - D. H. Withers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Integrating Bible stories that stretch across the centuries from each other along with a background of secular history and current events, Unbroken Cord uncovers the link that ties them all together. This book is what many believers have been looking for:  an easily understood synthesis between Old and New Testaments, past and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining a tourist&#39;s enthusiasm for exploration along with a love for detail and scripture, the author provides information that includes today&#39;s news, ancient prophecy, and a good bit of backstory.  Each of the twelve chapters is written with the goal of distilling its specific topic into an explanation that makes sense to the average person. Even if the reader lacks background regarding Biblical History or the current geopolitical situation, subjects that have previously seemed overly complicated or fuzzy, begin to fall into place. Since most everyone has fallen through the scholastic cracks at some point, each chapter is presented as an opportunity for some much needed &quot;catch-up&quot; information. The book is a personal tutoring session and survey approach to understanding Israel&#39;s place within the context of a modern Christian worldview.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the Bible is full of mystery. Unbroken Cord unlocks secrets about God&#39;s Calendar, fleshes out origins of the Middle East conflict, examines prophecies concerning Israel&#39;s future population boom and explores Jerusalem - from her distant past and into the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
