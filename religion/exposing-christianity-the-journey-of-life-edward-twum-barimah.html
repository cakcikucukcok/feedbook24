  <title>Exposing Christianity: the Journey of Life - Edward Twum-Barimah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE BIBLE COMMANDS US IN 2 TIMOTHY 2:15 TO study to
show yourself approved unto God, good workmen who need not to be ashamed
rightly dividing the Word of God/Truth. WHEN INFORMATION IS
PASSED FROM ONE PERSON OR FORM TO ANOTHER, SOME VITAL
PARTS MAY BE LOST OR MISREPRESENTED, SO IT IS IMPORTANT
TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT OR THE ORIGINATOR
OF THAT INFORMATION TO GET THE INTENDED MESSAGE/
INFORMATION. Exposing Christianity reveals Gods salvation plan and how
you can be certain you are in the kingdom of God.
My prayer for you is as you read through the pages of this book, you will
meet Christ, the one who died and rose to become the author and fi nisher of
our faith. This book is intended to challenge you, make you seek and appreciate
the reason for Christ. Over time and over the years, the gospel has been watered
down, supposedly to make it sinner friendly instead of keeping it Christcentered.
COLOSSIANS 1: 15HE IS THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD,
THE FIRSTBORN OVER ALL CREATION. 16FOR BY HIM ALL THINGS
WERE CREATED THAT ARE IN HEAVEN AND THAT ARE ON EARTH,
VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE, WHETHER THRONES OR DOMINIONS
OR PRINCIPALITIES OR POWERS. ALL THINGS WERE CREATED
THROUGH HIM AND FOR HIM. 17AND HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS,
AND IN HIM ALL THINGS CONSIST. 18AND HE IS THE HEAD OF THE
BODY, THE CHURCH, WHO IS THE BEGINNING, THE FIRSTBORN
FROM THE DEAD, THAT IN ALL THINGS HE MAY HAVE THE
PREEMINENCE. 19FOR IT PLEASED THE FATHER THAT IN HIM ALL
THE FULLNESS SHOULD DWELL, 20AND BY HIM TO RECONCILE
ALL THINGS TO HIMSELF, BY HIM, WHETHER THINGS ON EARTH
OR THINGS IN HEAVEN, HAVING MADE PEACE THROUGH THE
BLOOD OF HIS CROSS.
Exposing Christianity will take you on a journey, a journey of a lifetime into
Gods amazing kingdom. It is a journey of great discovery and recovery. Are you
ready? Lets go." />
