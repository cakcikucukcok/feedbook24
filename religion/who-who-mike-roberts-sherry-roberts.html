  <title>Who Who? - Mike Roberts, Sherry Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who? Who? was inspired as my wife and I sat at our breakfast table one morning. As we were watching the birds come to our bird feeder, I was reminded of a line in a song: His eye is on the sparrow. In just a few minutes, the rest of the ideas came to me. Some of them are based on other things God has spoken to me about while enjoying nature. You will recognize several Bible verses and biblical teachings within the story. It is my hope that parents and teachers will enjoy sharing with the young how to see God in every area of life and to recognize that He is with us every day. As they become aware of this, the Holy Spirit will teach them about the Father and Jesus through nature and everyday occurrences. I am sure we all have pleasant memories of stories that have stayed with us from childhood. I hope this small book and its story will be one of those.&lt;/p&gt;" />
