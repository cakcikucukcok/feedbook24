  <title>Joseph of Arimathea - Robert Cruikshank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joseph of Arimathea&lt;/i&gt; brings together modern research, ancient legends, and unique storytelling to trace the journey of Joseph of Arimathea from England to Palestine as he performs an annual pilgrimage there. During this particular trip to Palestine, Josephs world is turned upside down by the political crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of his enemies. Joseph, with his friend Nicodemus, buries Jesuss body according to Jewish ritual. For this, Joseph is himself arrested, but he is delivered from imprisonment by the risen Jesus. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an ardent believer in and follower of Gods chosen one, Joseph plays a vital role in establishing the early church and its subsequent missionary movement. After fourteen years in Palestine, Joseph returns to England as a missionary. He is sent there as the first bishop to England and Wales, where he later builds a church at Glastonbury. Joseph carries to England the silver chalice and silver plate used during the Last Supper, along with a staff fashioned from the crown of thorns placed on Jesuss head. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including a detailed appendix includes some of the surviving descendant lines of the two children of Joseph of Arimathea and his wife, Anna, Josephs story provides a fascinating account of some of the most precious historic Christian artifacts.&lt;br&gt;" />
