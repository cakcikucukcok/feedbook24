  <title>The Lost Island of Amwes (Am-Wes), a True Story - Nasako M. Weires-Madsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He was truly a man of God. He was vibrant and courageous in his Christian faith. Realizing he was called by God to evangelize the islanders, he was determined to at least touch one heart and change a life amidst great persecutions. Sent by the church in the United States of America, the Christian missionary felt alone and neglected on an island full of people who didn&#39;t want to do anything with his Christian God and teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was ridiculed, laughed at, and mocked, he silently and reverently turned to God for encouragement, wisdom, and guidance.  He spent many hours a day in prayers and reading his Bible, asking God for the grace he needs to overcome his trials and tribulations. Then one day, when he decided to leave the rebellious islanders in peace, out of the blue, God spoke through him and prophesied against the indigenous people and their island. Soon after, the prophesy came true and changed the lives of the present generation as well as the future generation forever! Consequently, to this day, the Christian faith is vibrant among the islanders in the Namoluk (Na-mo-look) atoll, Chuuk State, in the Federated States of Micronesia, both home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;" />
