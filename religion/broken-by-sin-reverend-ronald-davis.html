  <title>Broken by Sin - Reverend Ronald Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about how we need a savior. The penalty for sin is death, but Christ takes our sins and saves our souls when we accept him. This book deals with the issues of life without Christhow we live in a sinful world, cursed by God, until you accept his son Jesus. Did you ever wonder why your life is so messed up, even though you might be a good person? In this book I explain why: its because if youre not born againsaved by the cross of Christ and the blood of Christyoure living in a world that God cursed. On the cross Jesus redeemed us from the curse of the law so that we could be blessed by God again, reconciled back to God, and put in good right standing with him again. Jesus did all this on the cross for us. In the book I explain what happened to man because of sin in the Scriptures, and what happens to us when we accept Jesus. God loves us and made a way to get out of sin, be blessed again, and escape hell. Jesus did all of that for us. I explain it in the Word of God in this book and break it down so that you can understand salvation. If you die and never accept Jesus in your life, Revelation 20:15-20 says you will go to hell. Thats the gospel truth. It doesnt cost us anything to be savedjust a prayer and inviting Jesus into your heart and life. It cost him everything, but he did it because he loved us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
