  <title>Christformation in You - Ronald, Christinal Pillai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christformation is about the divine nature of Christ being successfully formed in you to the fullest, which is the Heavenly Fathers predestined and eternal will for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ is formed in your born-again spirit with the indispensable help of God, the Holy Spirit. Your soulyour mindis only then transformed into the mind of Christ in proportion to Christformation that has already occurred in your born again spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent to which you obey Christ our Lord will determine how much you are sowing into your new being. As a result of your obedient sowing, you will finally reap a proportionate body to clothe the Christ-formed spirit and transformed soul upon Christs second coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your imperishable, Christ-conformed body is being built at Gods right hand now, according to your personal obedience to His word. Therefore, isnt it then important to obey God the Holy Spirits leading for full Christformation in you? Would you want to be found partially unclothed or shamefully naked of Christs divine nature before God the Heavenly Father? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book highlights what you need to know about Christformation in you. These questions below are answered with Bible references to guide you to more truths about this essential experience in every believer of Christ, in fulfillment of Gods promise: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What is Christformation in you?&lt;BR&gt;
 Why is Christformation in you necessary? &lt;BR&gt;
 Where else is Christformation mentioned in the Bible? &lt;BR&gt;
 How does Christformation occur in you? &lt;BR&gt;
 Who will have Christformation? &lt;BR&gt;
 Who is involved with your Christformation? &lt;BR&gt;
 When does full Christformation happen in you?&lt;/p&gt;" />
