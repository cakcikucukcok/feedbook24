      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are all called; but few are chosen. Listen and let God lead you in the way you should serve him. Are you ready to jump in and start serving God but do not know where to begin? God has a plan for you here on earth no matter where you live. This is what author, Elizabeth ONeill, shares in her book. A small seed was planted in her heart and it grew into a full time ministry; serving people with food, clothing and shelter. Has God been calling you into ministry? Dont know where to start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONeill explains that we have nothing to fear when we trust God and let him take the wheel. How to do ministry in your own backyard, is a step by step guide to help you unfold Gods vision in your life. We need not be experts to do Gods work. Never doubt what a small group of dedicated Christians can do for God. Christ will prepare the way. Trust him and watch as his amazing plan unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will help you start serving those in need in your community right now. Churches, community groups, children and individuals joined the ONeill family to do his work in the rural village of Cattaraugus, New York. God brought the people and resources. Obey God and you will see his fruit grow.&lt;/p&gt;
