  <title>My Soul Rhythms - Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prayer remains one of the mightiest forces in the world. It draws you closer to the omnipotent, omniscient God. It increases your faith and empowers you to overcome obstacles. The prayer stories in My Soul Rhythms testify to the life-transforming power of prayer. These stories of bold prayers and real-life breakthroughs encourage you to experience prayer as a spiritual adventure with God and to see prayer as the best way to handle the ebbs and flows of life. My Soul Rhythms also challenges you to examine and strengthen your prayer practices.
Author Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb takes you on her walks in nature, on the tennis court, and to foreign lands on her year-long journey to make prayer primary as never before. In her collection of prayer stories, you find inspiration in George Washington Carvers early-morning prayers; Adelaide A. Pollards song Have Thine Own Way, and a Fort Hood Army chaplains prayer for a murder suspect.
My Soul Rhythms: Prayer Stories to Ignite Your Spirit offers a fresh look at an ancient discipline through one womans life and the lives of others who influenced her year-long faith journey to deeper prayer. The prayer stories in this book will inspire and affirm you as you draw closer to God. They will ignite in you a desire to make prayer primary in your own life." />
