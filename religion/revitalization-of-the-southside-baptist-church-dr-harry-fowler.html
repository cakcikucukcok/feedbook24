  <title>Revitalization of the Southside Baptist Church - Dr. Harry Fowler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A once grand &amp;mdash; but now shrinking &amp;mdash; church in need of an infusion of energy and excitement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Dr. Harry Fowler, a pastor with years of experience in helping churches across the USA grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Fowler reluctantly took on the charge of breathing new life into Southside Baptist church, which was in desperate need of CPR. With his expertly executed strategy, attendance grew from 100 to 305 in just one week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Southside Baptist Church, Dr. Fowler provides a step-by-step guide for revitalizing churches, including growth principles, assimilation of new members, entrance points and sermons. Using Southside Baptist as an example, Dr. Fowler illustrates how his strategies helped turn a church on the brink of closure into a thriving, growing center of faith in the community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following Dr. Fowler&amp;rsquo;s easy-to-read format, any pastor can use the steps within to turn a struggling church into a strong congregation. Included are photos documenting Southside Baptist&amp;rsquo;s growth, plus sample images of its advertising campaign and recruitment efforts that make it easy for any church to duplicate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Harry Fowler has 52 years of ministry experience as a pastor and church planter. He is also the founder of Youth On Mission. Dr Fowler received a M. Div from Southeastern Baptist Seminary and a D. Min from Fuller Seminary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
