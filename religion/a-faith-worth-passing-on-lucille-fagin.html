  <title>A Faith Worth Passing On - Lucille Fagin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is full of challenges. Some may be easily solved, while others seem almost insurmountable. They can come without warning and leave you with no idea of where to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As impossible as things may seem in these situations, it is important to know others have faced similar struggles and have emerged as better people for themand that you can do so, too. In A Faith Worth Passing On: My Mothers Attributes of Faith, author Lucille Fagin shares the story of how her mothers faith helped her through many difficult times, reminding her that God has created each of us with a specific purpose. Each trial you experience can help you become the person He wants you to be. Fagin also provides biblical references to help put everything in context of the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Faith Worth Passing On reminds us that God will help us through trials in order to achieve the plan He has for each of us. God will help us up when we fall and put us back on the right path when we detour. It will not be easy, but His help and strength are there for the asking.&lt;/p&gt;" />
