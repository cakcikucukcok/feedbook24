  <title>On Both Sides of the Street - Margery Wolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The devil hates us so much. He tries anything to the body, but he can&#39;t touch the soul. That&#39;s why I keep my body under subjection. I learned his tactics over the years. We have to watch those spirits and rebuke them as Jesus did. When he taught the disciples it was a spiritual teaching in the flesh, that&#39;s how they understood spiritual things. With Paul, the teaching from the beginning was spiritual in the Spirit. He understood spiritual things spiritually. He understood the spiritual connotations of life and godliness. Jesus taught the disciples, Christ taught Paul. He learned spiritual things spiritually where he applied everything natural to God and the Word. Jesus taught the disciples how to apply spiritual things to the natural understanding. With Paul, he lost sight of the world that he saw only Jesus. No one with him at the time of his conversion saw Jesus Christ, but they heard someone speaking. Paul saw and heard; in Christ, we see him and hear him. In the church, without the Holy Ghost, we only hear the Word, but is never able to see or understand what he is saying until we receive all of him. He is the Word lived. We are living souls that also live in the body that need the Word spoken that the Holy Ghost hears and make us alive again. We become lively stoneswe hear and obey the Word because the Spirit makes it alive to us. Better get a deeper perspective!" />
