  <title>The Destiny of Man - Daniel Amos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Destiny of Man&lt;/em&gt; is the exploration and the excavation of the New Creation-to fathom the depth of man both in his higher and lower natures. It is theosophical: a consciousness of the eternal truth and codification in the scripture about man and his great lover-the God of creation. The truth is divulged, and certain mysteries that stand as puzzles are revealed-about the mystical nature of man both in the Garden of Eden and the material world. Yes! The great mystery of the two different natures of man in Adam and Christ Jesus who answered the second Adam is unveiled so that the eternal life and victorious destiny of man may be achieved if the right choice is made. Whether one lives his life only according to his animal nature or not, going back to spiritual where we come from is a sine qua non.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is indeed a rapturous spiritual blossoming that kept religion and science in unending squabbles. Of course, science and spiritual matters can never agree, since science is the fruit of the intellectual mind of the material nature of man, which has lost the spiritual insight of God and the origin of man. As the scripture says, &amp;ldquo;For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God&amp;rdquo; And another text says, &amp;ldquo;My thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways&amp;rdquo; (Luke 16:15 and Isaiah 55:8).&lt;/p&gt;" />
