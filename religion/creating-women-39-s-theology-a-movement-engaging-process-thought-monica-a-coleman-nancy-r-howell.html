  <title>Creating Women&#39;s Theology: A Movement Engaging Process Thought - Monica A. Coleman, Nancy R. Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Creating Women&#39;s Theology engages women&#39;s questions: • Can women from different religious traditions engage one theological approach? • Can one philosophical approach support feminist religious thought? • What kind of belief follows women&#39;s criticism of traditional Christianity?  Creating Women&#39;s Theology offers a portrait of how some women have found room for faith and feminism. For the last twenty-five years, women religion scholars have synthesized process philosophy with their feminist sensibilities and faith commitments to highlight the value of experience, the importance of freedom, and the interdependence of humanity, God, and all creation. Cutting across cultural and religious traditions, process relational feminist thought represents a theology that women have created. This volume offers an introduction to process and feminist theologies before presenting selections from canonical works in the field with study questions. This volume includes voices from Christianity, Judaism, goddess religion, the Black church, and indigenous religions. Creating Women&#39;s Theology invites new generations of undergraduate, seminary, and university graduate students to the methods and insights of process relational feminist theology." />
