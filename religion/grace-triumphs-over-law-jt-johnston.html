  <title>Grace Triumphs over Law - Jt Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grace Triumphs over Law - The Scripture that Changed My Life is the story of one mans journey from living under the law to living under grace, from condemnation to salvation, and from darkness to light. While studying the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit brought clear understanding of the falsehood of his religion and the real truths found in Gods Holy Word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will examine hundreds of scriptural references and quotations to uncover the distinction between the old and new covenants (law and grace), demonstrating the promises and righteousness now available to all Christians through Jesus Christ our Lord. Examples from the law and its rituals are examined, explained, and shown to be predecessors to the new covenant of love, grace, and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be carried along this journey with him as we explore how good and gracious our God truly is, as demonstrated by the life, death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and teachings of God the Son. Gods free gift of Christs completed work has opened to us a better covenant with better promises, and the gift of the Holy Spirit to all who believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a handbook and study guide, for old and new Christians alike, concentrating on the new life found in Jesus, through His eternal sacrifice, which brought about the wonders of the new covenant between God and His saints.&lt;/p&gt;" />
