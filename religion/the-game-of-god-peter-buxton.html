  <title>The Game of God - Peter Buxton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world is not as it appears. The universe and all of life is a fantasy being played out and experienced by Godwith God being the only player. This is the ultimate game of solitaire! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Game of God&lt;/i&gt; explores this amazing game that God develops and plays as though illusion is reality, as though man and all other forms of life have their own separate lives and minds. They live in bodies, in the world; they are born, grow old, and die. Everything in the universe is held in shape by mind-patterns, and within the game God is constantly assessing play as it develops and as though it is real and not an illusion or dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter part of &lt;i&gt;The Game of God&lt;/i&gt; illustrates a fundamentally different way of playing the game of life by changing your view of yourself and others within the game. It offers explanations of how to play this fantasy game effectively, how to develop fully the character you find yourself playing at the moment, and how to express your abundance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years man has pondered on his identity, his relationship to God, and the meaning and purpose of life, and he is still pondering. &lt;i&gt;The Game of God&lt;/i&gt; shows how the answer to these profound questions lies within each of us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
