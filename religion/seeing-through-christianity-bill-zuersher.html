  <title>Seeing Through Christianity - Bill Zuersher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The only book youll ever need to read about Christianity. &lt;p&gt;
This remarkable book provides a critical overview of Christian beliefs and the evidence for them. Where did these beliefs come from? Are there good reasons to believe Christianity is true? &lt;p&gt;
Bill Zuersher clearly explains each of Christianitys major beliefs. He then proceeds to demonstrate significant difficulties with each of them. The book tackles these beliefs in a logical order, beginning with the problems at the root of virtually all religions, suffering and death, and culminating in their supposed resolution through Jesus. &lt;p&gt;
Mr. Zuersher also examines the evidence for Christianity, namely religious writings and the historical fact of the early Jesus movement. He makes the case that this evidence does not support the religions claims and he provides naturalistic alternative explanations for how its core beliefs arose. &lt;p&gt;
In these pages we see the coalescence of Jewish and Zoroastrian religious ideas with those of Greek philosophy and mystery cults, to form the belief system we recognize as Christianity today. The result, Mr. Zuersher argues, is not revealed truth, but rather a human patchwork which contains unwarranted assumptions and logical flaws, all founded upon questionable evidence. &lt;p&gt;
Entertaining throughout, it is must-reading for skeptics, apologists, and anyone interested the worlds largest religion or the culture wars behind todays politics  an invaluable resource for students and teachers, writers and debaters.&lt;p&gt;" />
