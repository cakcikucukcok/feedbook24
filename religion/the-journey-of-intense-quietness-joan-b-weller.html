  <title>The Journey of Intense Quietness - Joan B. Weller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journey of Intense Quietness&lt;/em&gt; is a story of amazing discovery. Twenty years ago, the Lord began to open my ears, sharpen my spiritual eyesight, and increase my longing to know the Father. As I learned to be tuned to His voice within me, I was nourished by Scripture and could receive His great words of direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weary and stressed believer, I invite you to come with me on this path that leads through hushed, still places and along quiet byways leading to the Father. You will read simple, frank, tender stories and life lessons. Walk this trail with me, entering into an inner quietness where preoccupations no longer distract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful work, profound, but simple writes a
friend. The words lodge inside me and transform, whether
I like it or not! This book is an inspiration to anyone who
is a follower of Christ. It is patient, kind, and presents
itself as a way of life that is available to all who want to
hear God, love Him and follow Him. Most of all, there is a
supernatural sense of Gods love for us, His children, and
how much he longs to be with us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
