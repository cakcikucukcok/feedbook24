  <title>Luther&#39;s Augustinian Theology of the Cross: The Augustinianism of Martin Luther&#39;s Heidelberg Disputation and the Origins of Modern Philosophy of Relig - Marco Barone, David J. Engelsma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;These theological paradoxes ... have been deduced well or poorly from St. Paul, the especially chosen vessel and instrument of Christ, and also from St. Augustine, his most trustworthy interpreter.&quot; These are some of Martin Luther&#39;s words that introduce his Heidelberg Disputation (1518), a collection of doctrinal theses that serves as a manifesto of Luther&#39;s theology. The German Reformer claimed that his theses were a faithful exposition not only of Pauline theology, but also of Augustine&#39;s doctrine of salvation.  Luther&#39;s Augustinian Theology of the Cross is an unprecedented commentary of Luther&#39;s Heidelberg Disputation. Through a wide range of Augustinian texts, the author shows the accuracy of Luther&#39;s claim. Moreover, the work offers some original considerations that are of interest to both theology and philosophy.  In the year of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, this volume is a lively and stimulating addition to the debate about the relationship between Augustine&#39;s soteriology and the theology of the Reformation." />
