  <title>The Power in the Mystery of Confessing Right Words in Faith! - Fidelis Edie Ngolle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is there a state or position in your life that you have desired to quit? Or a dream you have been longing to achieve? If your answer is yes, then this book, which reveals the ultimate key to unlocking (open) the door to your dream, is the right one for you.
The power of the mystery of confessing right words from the Word of God in scriptures has been hidden from many in the church over the years; no doubt the Bible accounts how the Israelites used their mouths to attract a curse (Num. 14: 13-14, 28), nonetheless, in recent times, by revelation (Eph. 3:3), a majority are now benefitting from the unmatchable reward it offers to a believers faith walk in Christ. The Holy Bible holds an elaborate account of the love and the blessings of God or prosperity (3 Jn. 2) while it states that, there is nothing expected of a believer or mankind to access the unfailing love of God. It is worth mentioning here that the prosperity of God is tied to certain principles, and without an alignment or obedience to these principles, there is no way anyone can access His realm of prosperity." />
