  <title>Does God Care? - Janet Bartholomew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Does God Care? is a collection of true stories from around the world dealing with personal experiences with God. Bartholomew begins the collection with her own story and then presents over 80 other accounts sent to her from people eager to share their experiences. The stories present many different ways in which God touched an individual&#39;s life and led them to Him. The stories submitted in the book deal with overcoming drug or alcohol addiction, being healed or experiencing a medical miracle. Others who wrote to Bartholomew tell of religious conversions or simple expressions of their deep love for God and how grateful they are to have experienced His love toward them and for the blessings they received.&lt;P&gt;Bartholomews own experiences are related first. One story she relates how God provided for her and her daughter when they experienced car trouble in the middle of nowhere in during the night. Bartholomew also writes of her near death experience as she went into the hospital for what was supposed to be routine outpatient surgery. As a result of the problematic surgery she experienced physical, emotional and financial hardships. She explains that her faith, as well as her church and family supplied her with strength she needed throughout her struggles.&lt;P&gt;Perhaps some of the most dramatic stories included in this collection deal with an individuals ability to overcome problems with substance abuse. In &quot;Spiritual Advisor&quot; the reader is introduced to a young lady who found herself addicted to both drugs and alcohol. With God&#39;s help, as well as instruction from her spiritual advisor and support from friends, she has been able to achieve a year of sobriety. She has also decided to fully dedicate he life to Christ. Another writer from New York relates her experiences with the Bowery Mission Women&#39;s Center. The Center helped her to overcome a lifelong addiction to drugs and showed her that God was the solution to her problems. Dan Cross presents a life story of how he overcame alcoholism and suicide attempts, but is now a Minister and assists others who face the same battles he fought.&lt;P&gt;Also included are stories describing miraculous occurrences. Jim Wilds of Alaska, tells how he was able, with Gods help, to survive falling into an icy river and fighting -60 degree wind chills. &lt;P&gt;James Hewitt tells of his encounter with God in a train yard. His car, though the gearshift was in drive, moved in reverse out of the way of two oncoming train cars. As a result of this incident and the audible conversation he says he had with God, Hewitt immediately stopped drinking and smoking pot. He is how a pastor and considers starting his own church.&lt;P&gt;More ordinary encounters with God are also included among the stories. One story relates how God used a simple sunset to capture one persons attention and helped refocus his mind to what was important in life. One man relates how he was not able to find true contentment until he turned his life and his talents over to God, even though he was financially successful and had archived what he thought he wanted from life. &lt;P&gt;Many stories of healing are included throughout this collection. In this category are accounts of overcoming medical conditions such as anorexia, hearing loss, diabetes and cancer. In each case the healed person expresses their deep love and appreciation for God and His presence in their adversity...&lt;/P&gt;" />
