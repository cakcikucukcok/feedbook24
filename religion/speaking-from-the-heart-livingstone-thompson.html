  <title>Speaking from the Heart - Livingstone Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Speaking from the Heart is a series of reflections designed for daily use by those who contemplate issues about the Bible and faith. 
Dr Thompson offers the world a rare gift in this work. He writes with the wisdom that comes from a long career as a pastor, a professor, and an advocate for religious reconciliation and human rights. Livingstone draws on his Jamaican roots to illuminate the meaning of Christ for people in many cultures. In beautifully accessible prose he invites readers to explore the meaning of Christian doctrine in the hope that they will glimpse the life-changing possibilities of the gospel. Like his spiritual ancestor, John Amos Comenius, Livingstone is a Moravian scholar who writes for the good of the whole world. 
Rev. Dr Craig Atwood, Moravian Theological Seminary, Bethlehem, USA 
In this book the author reflects critically on the implications of affirming the Christian faith but does so by writing from the heart and in a reader-friendly way. The book is rooted in changes going on in our world on many levels and offers a reliable pathway to live faith with courage, relevance, and integrity. 
Dr Michael OSullivan, SJ, All Hallows College, Dublin City University. Ireland" />
