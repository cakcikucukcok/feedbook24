  <title>The Apostle Paul and the Pauline Tradition - Stephen Finlan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;Much of the popular understanding of the apostle Paul has been shaped, not by Paul&#39;s letters themselves, but by the Acts of the Apostles. This understanding, many believe, leads to misunderstanding Paul&#39;s theology. In &lt;I&gt;The Apostle Paul and the Pauline Tradition&lt;/I&gt; Stephen Finlan takes a new approach, focusing on the letters themselves. He views the Pauline tradition as including the teachings and writings of Paul himself, the assimilation and often simplification of Paul&#39;s ideas by those who followed him and then wrote letters in his name, and the final form of the letters the church has labeled as Paul&#39;s. Through this broad, shifting, and expanding notion of tradition, readers will explore with Finlan such questions as:&lt;/P&gt;  &#39; What did Paul really think &#39;and write &#39;about Jesus, redemption, and the Christian life?&lt;BR&gt;  &#39; Who were the original audiences that first received these texts?&lt;BR&gt;  &#39; How and how much did Paul&#39;s followers change his ideas in the letters they wrote for&quot; him?&lt;BR&gt; &lt;P&gt;Finlan is convinced that this educated questioning and investigating becomes a valid part of the life of faith &#39;not &lt;I&gt;replacing faith,&lt;/I&gt; but joined to it. Through his accessibly written text, readers in the end will understand and agree.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Stephen Finlan, PhD, is an adjunct professor at Drew University and has taught at Fordham. He is also author of &lt;/I&gt;Problems with Atonement&lt;I&gt; and &lt;/I&gt;Options on Atonement in Christian Thought&lt;I&gt; (both published by Liturgical Press) as well as &lt;/I&gt;The Background and Content of Paul&#39;s Cultic Atonement Metaphors&lt;I&gt; (SBL and Brill, 2004).&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
