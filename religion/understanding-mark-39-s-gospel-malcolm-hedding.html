  <title>Understanding Mark&#39;s Gospel - Malcolm Hedding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Heddings commentary on Marks Gospel captures the fast moving pace of Jesuss ministry in the Galilee before He ascended to Jerusalem for His final and fateful celebration of the Passover. Jesus is truly about His Fathers business as He calls His Disciples, proclaims the good news of the Gospel to the poor, heals the sick and casts out demons and embarks on a preaching circuit designed to reach the region with the message of Gods love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important of all is the fact that Hedding demonstrates how Jesuss teaching and deliverance ministry is relevant to every Christian today. This is not just a commentary that gives background information and the meaning of words in the original language; no it is a devotional study of the life of Christ, as we know it, thus enriching the reader and encouraging him or her to be a fully devoted follower of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever a book is a must read it is this one by Malcolm Hedding. In it he gives an in-depth, concise and clear understanding of Marks Gospel for meditation on Jesuss ministry, which will inspire the reader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eira Goldsworthy is an author, artist and illustrator working freelance for many international publishing houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows Malcolm Hedding knows that he loves the Bible and the Gospel message is the foundation of his work as a biblical expositor. Furthermore, Heddings many years spent in Israel have enriched his grasp of the Evangelist Marks historical record. For these reasons and many more, Understanding Marks Gospel is a treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
