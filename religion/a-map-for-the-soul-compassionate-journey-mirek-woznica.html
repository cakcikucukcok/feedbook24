  <title>A Map for the Soul…   Compassionate Journey… - Mirek Woznica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do we continue to journey in a particular direction even though we know, deep down, it is not the right path? Why do we live with no peace in our souls? These are some of the questions the author is challenged to answer after an unexpected event.
It was an ordinary day that turned into an extraordinary encounter. Even though he did not expect any changes in his life, the journey took him to a place of compassion that led to some life-changing decisions. Was it God or his personal choices that led him to this? Was it an accident or Gods loving plan?
There are journeys we take, trips we plan, and decisions we make. There are weeks and years ahead of us with adventures waiting. Let A Map for the Soul Compassionate Journey be your companion in times of darkness and confusion when circumstances tell you, You have reached your destination, but you know you are lost or stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wondrous story could be your guide through the mysteries of your personal journey, spiritual growth, and gaining an understanding of yourself. The esoteric and unique places and encounters of the characters add another dimension and another insight to your spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters will take readers into the world of personal strengths and weaknesses as well as deep cultural and spiritual differences. Once you immerse yourself in all of that, you will create A Map for the Soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
