    Faith-Hope-Love Of These Three: Love being the greatest.

    Gods Way Is Always Best

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    On, August ninetieth, Karshara Lexington turned seventeen. She had always known in her heart that something very special would happen for her, she just
    didnt know when. Even though she was not quite sure what, she still lived with great anticipation every day for the past three years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Little did she know this day would be the beginning of a life she would never forget. This year she would meet the man who would become the love of her
    life. To her greatest surprise, she is not meeting him in the natural world, but in the spiritual world, in her dreams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Karshara is now torn between the joy she is feeling in the world she experiences in her dreams, and the natural world that she was born into. Never in her
    wildest imagination would she have expected to be given a gift that would give her the unlimited power to travel between worlds.Yet, this will not come
    without a price.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Now she has to help her family and those whose lives have been greatly impacted, to understand why her mother and their friend Lisa, is lying in a hospital
    fighting for her life, along with the child whose life put her in this situation. The hospital is located just outside of Chicago on the Wisconsin border.
    and is hidden, for the safety of the two of them. If that weren&#39;t enough she soon learns of the gift within her younger sister Kascey, and just how far her
    older sister Kari has fallen away from God in her heart. So sit back and enjoy. Thank-you from the bottom of my heart.
&lt;/p&gt;
