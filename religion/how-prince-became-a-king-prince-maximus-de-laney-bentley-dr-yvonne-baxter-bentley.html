  <title>How Prince Became a King - Prince Maximus De-laney Bentley, Dr. Yvonne Baxter Bentley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written to my son Prince Maximus DeLaney Bentley in my efforts as his mother Dr. Yvonne B. Bentley to break the curse of your father, father. This curse is called the generation curse. There are men and women in the Body of Christ who believe in James 2:7,8; If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, you do well: 9). But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law, as transgressors. 10). For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. I asked God for you like Sarah ask for Isaac and he gave me Prince. You are not a mistake. It is because of the blood of Jesus Christ that you and your fatherless friends can be restored from you fathers curse. You are now apart of 1 Peter 2:9; But you are a chose race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, (Gods own purchase, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. (Exod. 19:5,6) 10). Once you were not a people (at all), but now you are Gods people, once you were unpitied, but now you are pitied and have received mercy (Hos. 2: 23).
	This book is written for all of the young boys and girls who need direction to break the curse of your fathers, father. This is contribution in breaking the Gehazi and King Balak curse. Dont let your father in the Lord Pastor Ed Brinson take his anointing to the grave. You have a resurrected anointing that can pray your father and his father back home. My dream is that one day you and your nature father will walk together in the breakers anointing. This anointing can break the generational curses from your children, children, childrens. May God restore the fathers as kings in there homes, on their jobs, in there communities, cities, and states. Kings of the earth arise; your Queens are tired of ruling." />
