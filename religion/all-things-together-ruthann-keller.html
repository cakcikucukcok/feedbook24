the strength to go through one tragedy at a time is difficult. Finding the
strength to endure one catastrophic change in your life after another is nearly

many life-changing events all within a few years time.&lt;span

surgical technologist in a suburban hospital takes away her health and
career.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Meanwhile her father is lost to
cancer and her mother is diagnosed with cancer two months later.&lt;span

own mortality, her husband of twenty-seven years leaves her for another
woman.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;She begins to question her
belief in God, blaming Him for her situation and her health.&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;All of this while she is in the midst of a
multi-million dollar lawsuit! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

her faith in her Savior was the first step in putting her life back
together.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Jenny emerges from her trials
a stronger, more spirit-filled, woman as she proves that all things work
together for the good, to those that love the Lord. Romans 8:28 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
