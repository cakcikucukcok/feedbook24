  <title>Secular Music and Sacred Theology - Tom Beaudoin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the basic conceptions of the world held by whole generations in the West are formed by popular culture, and in particular by the music that serves as its soundtrack, can theology remain unchanged? The authors of the essays in this important volume insist that the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These gifted theologians help readers make sense of what happens to religious experience in a world heavily influenced by popular media culture, a world in which songs, musicians, and celebrities influence our individual and collective imaginations about how we might live. Readers will consider the theological relationship between music and the creative process, investigate ways that music helps create communities of heightened moral consciousness, and explore the theological significance of songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors to this fascinating collection include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; David Dalt Maeve Heaney Daniel White Hodge Michael J. Iafrate Jeffrey F. Keuss Mary McDonough Gina Messina-Dysert Christian Scharen Myles Werntz &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tom Beaudoin is associate professor of theology at Fordham University, specializing inpractical theology.
