  <title>Beautiful - Sheila Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God Has A Beautiful Plan For Your Life &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If You Will Do It His Way &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women today live in a world that demands excellence and perfection. Every woman, no matter the age, the culture or the background desperately searches for love and acceptance. In the worlds kingdom, it is all about outward appearance. Come journey with me through the pages of &quot;Beautiful&quot; into God&#39;s kingdom where beauty is all about His inward presence.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We will take the word &quot;Beautiful&quot; and letter by letter discover truths in God&#39;s Word that will empower us and change us forever. These nine verses provide a strong foundation where God will build His superstructure. Through this interactive study, we will be set free from the world&#39;s standards. No time increments or restraints have been used to allow the Holy Spirit to guide you through this journey.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God has called us to be different in a world that is the same. He has chosen us to stand out from the crowd and let His light shine through us so that others will see our good deeds and glorify our Father in heaven. We will experience joy, sorrow, pain and finally freedom as we are delivered from bondage we have lived in for so many years.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Stand with me my sweet, new friend and repeat these life changing words as we raise our hands in surrender to the One who loves us with an everlasting, unconditional love.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;WE ARE BEAUTIFUL&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WE ARE FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;WE HAVE BEEN FASHIONED&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;WE ARE DESIGNED TO BE LIKE HIM&lt;/p&gt;" />
