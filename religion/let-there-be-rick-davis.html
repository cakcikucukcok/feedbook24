  <title>Let There Be __________ - Rick Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let There Be ; What would you be like if you became the person God expects you to be? entwines several strands that make their way through the Bible. First, as the title hints, God has created people. Then, when Jesus gave the three steps for living faithfully as his discipledenying oneself, taking up the cross, and following himhe outlined the non-negotiable essentials of the authentic life that moves from simply believing that Jesus is the Christ to being his disciple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Davis, reflecting on his own move from belief to discipleship, explores how one can choose to embrace the calling of Jesus, to shoulder the yoke of discipleship, and to persist in ones obedience to God. Let There Be helps one to see how the disciples life is a time of learning to be the kind of person that God created and to follow his Son. As the final chapter notes, Eventually all things must be reconciled to God in a kingdom where only his will prevails. We are being trained to live in this kingdom, not the present one. We are not compatible with this present evil world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sense that a deeper and more profound life of discipleship is calling you to greater obedience to Jesus Christ, then Let There Be will share with you the fundamental insights to listen to his callto deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
