  <title>Swimming In the Ocean of the Divine: An Odyssey Through Love, Loss and Rebirth - Catherine Kominos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was January 1, 2000, when author Catherine Kominos received a call from God-an invitation to set sail on an odyssey of discovery, remembrance, and inner growth. Easily seduced by the divine&#39;s transcendent gifts, she accepted the invitation. Only after the ship had sailed did the perils of the journey and the sacrifices demanded by it become evident.  In this personal narrative, Kominos shares her personal odyssey of spiritual growth and transformation from a Pentagon engineer to guru. Accustomed to looking outside of herself for fulfillment, her experiences showed her nothing external is permanent, nor can the external fulfill the deep longing within for something more.  A hero&#39;s journey through love, loss, and rebirth, Swimming in the Ocean of the Divine spans adventures through unconceivable calamities, misfortunes, pilgrimages, and moments of unforgettable spiritual bliss. Kominos discovers the power of love, forgiveness, and the courage to face life&#39;s challenges with grace." />
