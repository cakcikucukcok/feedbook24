  <title>Words of Worth - Sandra H. Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you sitting on the mountaintop with Jesus or down groveling in the mud puddles? Words of Worth travels both places. Sandra Meyers spiritual journey through life resembles that of many others, and she writes from her familiarity of both the good and hard times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical ideas to help you grow come from ordinary activities, nature, and experience. Often Christians march forward, only to take a slow ride downhill, unaware until weve already lost ground. Biblical people experienced the same frustrating situations, showing us through their examples how to get up and advance again. Sharing her defeats as well as victories, Sandra has e-mailed her meditations for several years and has responses like those below. Some topics discussed in Words of Worth include trials, trouble, and temptations; discipline; contentment; and intimacy with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Karen Davis suggested the title Words of Worth because when I read Sandra Meyers meditations, I usually say Wow! and they are worth so much to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melvin Gordy says, When I had to have an operation  I found that by reading articles like the ones Sandra Meyer writes I got relief. That is the real reason I wanted to see Words of Worth published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhonda Baronne tells, I am in a nursing home ministry. We have shared the meditations with the residents, and they were truly blessed. Sandra Meyers writings are very uplifting and encouraging. Just the right word at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See why Sandras meditations earn such enthusiastic endorsements, and learn how you can enhance your faith as you read Words of Worth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
