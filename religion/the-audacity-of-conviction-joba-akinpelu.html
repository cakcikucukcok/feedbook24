  <title>The Audacity of Conviction - Joba Akinpelu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yes, indeed, the tomb of Jesus was empty the third day! Is this a myth or a reality? Despised and rejected of men as a blasphemer, was his crucifixion a murder or a sacrifice? He was revered as Son of God, Son of Man, Lamb of God, and the Lion of tribe of Judah! Did Jesuss personality actually fit the billing of these self-contradictory designations?
By inspiration? Does inspiration then automatically confer absolute literary authenticity on every ecclesiastical work selected by few individuals and published in sacred books? To what extent can we rely on this axiom?
Made from the rib of Adam? Till this very moment, every male Jew is proud of his heritage of not being born as a woman or as a slave! So is it a burden of inferiority crises to be created as a woman? Most importantly, was Eve really a by-product from the rib of Adam?
Homosexuality! The battle rages on, for and against. But is apparent attraction between homosexuals based on sexuality or due to other compelling reasons that result in same-sex couples walking down the aisle to tie the conjugal knot?
These and other spiritually burning issues were deeply x-rayed. The work exposes barriers already set up assiduously by traditional beliefs, ideas, and schisms of religious dogmatisms. It challenged time-honored views and rent asunder many a false claim. Therefore, it is not unexpected if its contents attract relentless criticisms and opposition from circles of those already sided with rigidity and hypocrisy of philosophy and religions, particularly those professionally involved in the trade of perfidy.
Truthfulness can never breed doubters nor idiosyncrasies of fundamentalism, whose main goal was to enslave minds of other human beings. It is on this basis that readers may recognize the true worth of this work." />
