  <title>Edge of the Map: One Year in a Closed Country - Pilgrim Tyne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I can&#39;t tell you my name. I can&#39;t tell you where I live. I can&#39;t tell you who I work for, or any details about the people with whom I work. Because where I live, my line of work is not exactly legal. But if you can pardon the vagueness, I have a story for you.  Edge of the Map is a memoir of the calling and adjustment, success and failure of our first year as missionaries to a closed country in the 10/40 window. It tells the story of how my family and I lived out the challenges and blessings of the lives we tried to lay down for Jesus. It is the book I would have wished for, had I known the right questions to ask.  How do I know that I&#39;m called overseas? How do I move beyond callousness and distraction? What do I do once I&#39;ve accepted a call to the nations? What issues arise after I step into my calling? How do I go about resolving those issues?  Edge of the Map speaks to these questions in hopes that our journey to a closed country will help nudge the souls of a young, poised generation toward the calling God is whispering over their lives." />
