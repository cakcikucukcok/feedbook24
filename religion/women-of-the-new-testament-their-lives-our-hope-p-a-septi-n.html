  <title>Women of the New Testament: Their Lives, Our Hope - Pía Septién</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Women of the New Testament, Pía Septién presents eleven women who encountered the living God. Some knew him personally and spoke with him, like Mary Magdalene or the sisters, Martha and Mary. Others, like Elizabeth, recognized him as God even before he was born. In their friendships with Christ, these women found strength for their lives. Their stories are offered here in prose, with reflections on the virtues and lessons they teach us, notes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church, questions for the individual and group, and prayers. When you use Women of the New Testament as a guide for personal reflection or as a group Bible study, you&#39;ll discover what it was that those women saw in Jesus, what led them to follow him, and what they teach us today. You will also realize what he saw in them; for just like us, they were in need of God&#39;s love.  Women of the New Testament include:  Mary the Mother of Jesus  Mary Magdalene  Elizabeth, Mary&#39;s cousin  Anna the Prophetess  Martha and Mary (Lazarus&#39; sisters)  Samaritan Woman  Lydia, who opened her heart and home to Jesus  Hemorrhaging  The Widow and her Offering  Non-Jewish Woman" />
