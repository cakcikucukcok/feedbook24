  <title>&quot;Tailor-Made!&quot; - Zaphnath-paaneah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever watched your most cherished dreams suddenly go blazing up in flames and smoke with absolutely nothing you can do to stop it? Have you often wondered if the dreams youve so deeply desired through the years will ever come to pass? Or, has your hope been deferred and your heart become sick causing you to abort all expectation in seeing the fulfillment of your long-awaited dreams? Well if any of the above describes you, then you my friend are not alone. 
	In this cutting-edge, inspirational love story and prophetic-teaching ensemble, the author brilliantly captures some of the dramatic-biblical scenes from the prophetic journey and amazing life of Joseph, the man whose dreams came true. And then he ingeniously connects those biblical scenes together with some of his own extremely painful, personal life experiences, and presents them in part in a colorful display of clear and concise interpretations. However, after enduring intense hardships including great rejection and betrayal, vicious lies, false accusations, and recurring injusticethis man Joseph whom many even considered to be dead, miraculously resurrected from his spiritual tomb and soon became one of the Bibles youngest and first Billionaire philanthropists, and one of the greatest leaders and relevant voices of his generation. Therefore, in light of Josephs very humble beginnings and then Super-success that he fully enjoyed in the latter years of his life, this very insightful and user-friendly manual also reveals universal success principles that can be applied and enjoyed by anyone despite their age, gender, ethnicity or past mistakes. Perhaps that is why after his jealous, older brothers violently stripped him of his beautiful tunic of many colors that his father tailor-made and placed upon him, Joseph boldly declared to his brothers many years later: 
	But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass as it is this day, to save many people alive! (Genesis 50:20) 
	And with that being said, I announce to you, that, This is that day (the Third Day)Its Harvest Time NOW, so get ready for a Resurrection of your buried dreams! Now buckle your seatbelts because we are about to travel at the speed of thought and go on a tailor-made, prophetic journey from the pit, to the prison, to the palace! As you read this powerful story, be encouraged and know that regardless of who may have rejected you or whatever hardships you may have been through, like Joseph, your dreams can still come true!" />
