  <title>Whispers in the Wind, Shouts in the Storm! - Anna Beth Fore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing a persons relationship with God, Whispers in the Wind, Shouts in the Storm offers a collection of poems that communicates a message of hope and inspiration that God is always present for his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Beth Fore offers whispers in the wind poems as prayers of praise, thanksgiving, reflection, and appreciation of God in nature and in relationships, and she explores themes of Jesus and the Holy Spirit and mans relationship to them. She also shares shouts in the storm poems as a result of the difficulties and challenges in life. Many of the selections are paired with relevant scripture to encourage further Bible study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Whispers in the Wind, Shouts in the Storm Fore conveys the message that Christians have a God who is creative, powerful, and faithful. He desires a relationship with his children, and we have the privilege and honor to worship him, honor him, and pray to him at any time and under any circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
