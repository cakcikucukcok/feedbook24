  <title>The One Song - Jeannie Carrera Chow Yoke Lin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is an amazing adventure that inspires timeless questions: Why are we here? Why was I born into this world? What is the meaning of life?
When things go wrong, its easy to rage into the void of despair. Why is this happening to me? What have I done to deserve this? Why me?
Sometimes, all you need in moments of sorrow or confusion is the knowledge that someone out there cares and wants to help. Author Jeannie Carrera Chow Yoke Lin can be that caring someone for you. In The One Song she offers up some potential answers to the questions we all ask in a series of short stories. The game of life shouldnt be taken too seriously, she advises. Its just a movie or a show; act like a movie star, and learn to live life to the fullest. We are what we think, and to change your life experience, you simply need to change your life perspective. Think positively to invite positivity. Its that simple!
Her wish is to help people find the joy in their hearts, some fairness in their minds, and the love in their souls. When you can learn to see the love in everythingin both times of joy and sorrowyou will experience the truth that love is all there is. Its all you need to live a full life. 
Jesus said, Love your neighbour as yourself. Jeannie says, Love your neighbours, for they are yourselves. Welcome to your new life!" />
