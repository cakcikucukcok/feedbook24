  <title>Power to Transform the Natural by the Supernatural - Dr. Raha Mugisho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People have to stop with cold religious prayer and worship and enter deeply in spiritual adoration, banishing all vain words, which reflect a lack of faith, knowing that without faith, it is impossible to please God. Your holiness is hidden in your faith because in the true faith abide holiness and Gods love; without faith, there is no true holiness. If you are not receiving answers to prayer, something must be wrong in the matter of faith. That is the reason the Word of God says, Without faith, it is impossible to please God.
Your possession, your title, and your position must kneel before God, not only your spirit. The way you think is what you are. Put the Word of God first; the promises of God are yours. Confess the Word in all circumstances, and you will not be ashamed if you truly believe.
God didnt send anybody to destroy the sinners or the backsliders but to bring them to the light, using His love and compassion. We are not traveling with the names of backsliders but the name of Jesus. If I want to deal with such things, the Bible tells me to meet the person and talk with him, to show him the truth and pray for him and not to reject or to curse him. That is the mistake that many religious men do, and it destroys not the devil, but the work of God.
Mark 9: 23 IF YOU CAN ALL THINGS IS POSSIBLE . . ." />
