  <title>Into the Mist - Kathleen Beard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This personal, intimate journey weaves the theme and experience of walking through the maze, confusion and intense emotional pain of watching someone you love disappearing into a mist of dementia. Kathleen examines the emotional, physical and spiritual battle that rages while juggling the very practical and mundane duties of facing a health crisis. Added to this, for a believer in Jesus Christ, are the throes of faith-challenging issues which inevitably surface. This book probes the devastation of watching her strong, loving and very funny husband morph into a diminished soul, whose personality has disappeared, but who insists that he is fine, leaving her to deal with the myriads of broken pieces of their lives and the ongoing grieving process which has no end in sight.. Told in a journalistic style, with writings from personal journals kept over a period of four years, Kathy relates all of the ins and outs, the ups and downs, of wading through crucial decisionsboth financial and health, as well as emotional decisions to trust God, who at times seems an unfamiliar friend. It follows this faith journey through to the end result which is that no matter where God may take our lives, and no matter how the story ends, He is enough and He can be trusted and He does have a plan in mind, regardless of how murky that plan might appear in the process. Kathleen invites us into the journey through this process and leaves us with overcoming victory in Christ." />
