  <title>God, Marriage, and Family (Second Edition) - Andreas J. K&amp;ouml;stenberger, David W. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The release of the landmark first edition of &lt;em&gt;God, Marriage, and Family&lt;/em&gt; provided an integrated, biblical treatment of God&#39;s purposes for the home. Since then, explain authors Andreas K&amp;ouml;stenberger and David Jones, the crisis confronting modern households has only intensified, and yet the solution remains the same: obedience to and application of God&#39;s Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second edition of &lt;em&gt;God, Marriage, and Family&lt;/em&gt;, K&amp;ouml;stenberger and Jones explore the latest controversies, cultural shifts, and teachings within both the church and society and further apply Scripture&#39;s timeless principles to contemporary issues. This new edition includes an assessment of the family-integrated church movement; discussion of recent debates on corporal punishment, singleness, homosexuality, and divorce and remarriage; new sections on the theology of sex and the parenting of teens; and updated bibliographies. This book will prove to be a valuable resource for personal and group study, Christian counseling, and marriage and family courses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
