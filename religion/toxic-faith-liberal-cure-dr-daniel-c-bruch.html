  <title>Toxic Faith - Liberal Cure - Dr. Daniel C. Bruch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Toxic Faith: Liberal Cure&lt;/b&gt; is an answer to those who claim that liberalism is immoral and is somehow destroying the values of this country. It also seeks to provide a careful and rational response, in a specifically Judeo-Christian context, to many of the most vocalized and divisive current issues: patriotism, war, abortion, homosexuality, poverty, and the environment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;Liberal&quot; is not a four-letter word.
We are living in a time where &quot;moral values&quot; receive much play in the
popular press. Rarely, if ever, however, do the discussions about &quot;moral
values&quot; (meaning primarily Judeo-Christian values in our culture) include
any serious discussion of what the Jewish and Christian Scriptures actually
say about the primary conflicted issues of this day. The authors address
if and how Judeo-Christian moral values may be related to liberal values
within the context of selected social issues.
This book is an answer to those who claim that liberalism is immoral and
is somehow destroying the values of this country. It also seeks to provide
a careful and rational response, in a specifically Judeo-Christian context,
to many of the most vocalized and divisive current issues: patriotism, war,
abortion, homosexuality, poverty, and the environment.
Using quiet, confident scholarship and reason, the authors seek to restore
and energize a more informed Christian faith. It is designed to be read
by everyone who is alarmed about the political encroachments of the
religious right: liberals who are Christians, liberals who arent Christians,
secularists, and moderates who are concerned about religious freedom and
the separation of church and state.
&quot;a reasoned, serious analysis of some of societys most
contentious issues. Again, conservatives may not buy (the)
arguments in the end, but at least (theyre) speaking in a
language conservatives will understand.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Alston B. Ramsey&lt;/b&gt;, National Review Online, February 15, 2006&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Having trouble coming up with responses to the religious right on critical issues of the day? This book is a scholarly, yet down-to-earth discussion of topics such as patriotism, war, poverty, abortion, homosexuality and the environment. Each chapter includes talking points that can raise your comfort level in responding to the uninformed or biased rhetoric of the right.&quot;  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;MiniMe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Illinois&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This book offers valid perspectives on crucial issues that are dividing our country. I love that each chapter concludes with suggestions for positive action and discussion points. Very worthwhile!&quot;  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;J. Powers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;In our sound byte-addicted world of attack-journalism, I&#39;m amazed that a book can find its way into publication that thoughtfully addresses the most difficult moral issues of our time without name-calling and political posturing. Don&#39;t let the title fool you - this is not an outlet for liberals to counter-attack the extreme-right. This book addresses the most contentious issues of our time from a background of faith that helps the reader look at their own beliefs and gain empathy for others&#39; beliefs.&quot;  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;R. Andersen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This book is the only one that directly and concisely addresses some of the most difficult religious issues that are discussed in the public arena these days. It includes obvious choices such as abortion and homosexuality, but it also gives thoughtful consideration to poverty, the environment and the war. In language that is understandable by almost everyone, the authors present significant research from the Judeo-Christian Scriptures and the historical record that set straight many of the misconceptions of the religious right. It also provides very helpful talking points and suggestions for personal actions related to the topics.&quot;  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Canuck&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
