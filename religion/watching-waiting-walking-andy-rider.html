  <title>Watching, Waiting, Walking - Andy Rider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Engaging and anecdotal in style, Watching, Waiting, Walking is structured around three key moments in the transformation of one of Jesus&#39; closest friends: St Peter. In the garden of Gethsemane, Peter is told to &#39;watch&#39; his life. Then, along with the other disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration, he is told to &#39;wait&#39; for the Holy Spirit. And in Jerusalem, following Pentecost, he &#39;walks&#39; out to address the crowd, and subsequently heals a crippled man who begins to walk himself. Andy Rider believes that reflecting on this pattern of watching, waiting and walking can not only help to shape our prayers on a daily basis, but also to deepen our ability to perceive where we are in the cycle of discipleship. And given the author&#39;s honesty about his own times of struggle and reassurance, this warm-hearted volume cannot fail to encourage us - whatever our circumstances - to become more open to the work of God&#39;s transforming spirit." />
