  <title>Life on the Line - Marilyn Costanza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt lonely or disconnected from people and the world? Life on the Line seeks to help you realize that you share a connection to everyone and everything in the universe and that there is no reason to ever feel alone again. Life on the Line contains a varied selection of quotations from sages, scientists, scholars, spiritual leaders, and artists regarding the interconnectedness of all things. You will see that all philosophies and religions and even quantum physics recognizes the interconnectedness of all things. Dark matter, string theory, Eastern and Western religions, and the philosophies of the native peoples all speak to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilyns photographs of clotheslines, taken from a wide variety of countries throughout the world, display this concept of interconnectedness. When you see a clothesline, there is an immediate connection, because all humans experience the activity of laundry. Although each clothesline is unique, like the fingerprints of the person who hung the clothes, the underlying activity of laundry is immediately understood. The photographs contained in this book help you visualize the interconnectedness by showing you that from the USA to Easter Island, the human condition connects us all to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life on the Line will offer you an opportunity to reflect on the interconnectedness of all life during our experience of planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
