  <title>The Never Ending March - Sergio Ticozzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Father Sergio Ticozzi, a prominent Italian missionary, has produced an important new account of the religious policies of the Chinese Communist government.&amp;nbsp; It is clear from his account that religion has long been a central preoccupation of the Communist government and that it continues to be so today.&amp;nbsp; The government has long engaged not only in suppression of Christian and other religious beliefs but, increasingly, in campaigns to manipulate those beliefs and channel them into serving the political purposes of the state and Party.&lt;br /&gt;
