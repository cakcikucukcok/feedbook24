  <title>Emotional Freedom - Jane Ault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How satisfied are you with your level of emotional and spiritual maturity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel discouraged by lack of progress in your spiritual life? Frustrated by failures to follow through on your good intentions? Embarrassed by discrepancies between your outer appearance and inward reality? Stuck in damaging emotionssuch as anger, resentment, and revenge? If yes is your answer to any of these questions, be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Emotional Freedom, Jane Ault shows you how to move from the bondage of emotional dysfunction to the freedom of emotional integrity so that you can grow toward spiritual maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories by those who have moved from anger to self-control, resentment to joy, and revenge to forgiveness inspire you to persevere in your healing journey. The Tree model of emotion expands your understanding of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dance called Choosing Grace tells you how to cooperate with God so that you can receive his grace and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maps of anger, resentment, and revenge help you recognize stages in the development of addictive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maps of self-control, joy, and mercy show you steps in the pathway to freedom. A study guide listing key concepts, plus questions for reflection and discussion, helps you integrate these new concepts into your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gem of a book offers us a key to release the shackles of dysfunction that keep us bound to an immature past. From personal experience and with great insight, compassion, a scriptural foundation, and incisive writing, Jane leads the reader from stoic brokenness to emerging freedom.  Carolyn M. White, abd, MA, CASAC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane writes knowledgeably about recognizing destructive patterns in our lives, understanding the dynamics that fuel them, and moving forward with God to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;
