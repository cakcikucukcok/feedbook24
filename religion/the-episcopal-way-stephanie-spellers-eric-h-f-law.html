  <title>The Episcopal Way - Stephanie Spellers, Eric H. F. Law</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Updated content and approach, compared to earlier New Church&#39;s Teachings series, with emphasis on mission and applicability  • Interactivity is emphasized throughout with robust study guides, links to a host of web and video resources, and jargon-free language  The New Church&#39;s Teachings was one of the most recognizable and useful book series in the Episcopal Church. The books were a mainstay on seminarian and clergy bookshelves. With this launch of the Church&#39;s Teachings for a Changing World series, two visionary Episcopal thinkers and church leaders team up to revitalize the currency, integrity, and scholarship of the original series with fresh new voices and style; concise and clear enough for  ewcomers, yet grounded and thoughtful enough for seminarians and leaders.  In this foundational text for the Church&#39;s Teachings for a Changing World, Law and Spellers explore seismic shifts in American life and the opportunities and challenges each presents to the church today. With a winning combination of passion, creativity, and wisdom, the authors call for a return to Episcopal basics and insist that faithfully engaging a changing world might be the most truly Anglican practice of all." />
