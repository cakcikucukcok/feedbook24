  <title>The Laws of God and the Laws of the State Vol. 2. - Reverend Lawrence L. Blankenship</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reverend Lawrence L. Blankenship&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; has created a new book offering a fresh look at one of the most imnportant, and controversial works for men and women to study. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Laws of God and The Laws of The State Vol. 2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; NOTE: If We Obey The Laws of God, Well Not Dis-obey The Laws of The State. The Laws of God and The Laws of The State Vol. 2., is a Christian work that attempts to reconcile con-temporary secular law with ancient laws of the Bible. This volume is divided into two sections: one outlines the statutes of Gods laws, and Scriptural laws, and the other studies The Laws of The State. Within the first section you learn the basis of biblical laws. In the second section you learn how these laws may be applied to contemporary law. This volume also includes the Civil and Criminal laws of Gods and Statutes of the State, for easy reference. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Laws of God and The Laws of The State Vol. 2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, seeks to provide an informed perspective on the biblical references to legal matters. This approach may be appropriate for students of the Bible or students of jurisprudence. The author hopes the public will obtain an understanding of the entire process, while developing skills neccessary to understand both laws." />
