  <title>God’S Vision, My Vision - Robert “Bobby” Florence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A book that will have one cognizant of whatever dark, and bleak circumstances or situations one may be in, and eventually will find themselves in, the answer was here before any problem existed. The discovery and importance of not wasting time and energy concentrating on the problem, its a waste of time, knowing the answer is never found in the problem its always revealed in the answer. The search for significance to discover the real you which lives inside of you, that only God the Father can reveal unto you of who you were predestined, ordained, and anointed to be. Youll be taken on a fascinating and exciting journey in your inner most being where youll locate hidden treasures and gifts, God has deposited inside of you like fireworks ready to explode and reveal the greatness inside of you. This book is filled with the Word of God, and will renew you in the spirit of your mind. Youll begin to look at problems as preparation, trouble, as training and transition, and if one is a doer of the Word and not a hearer only it will transform one into the more than conqueror and overcomer God has created us to be in Jesus Christ!
May your testimony inspire readers to know the testimony of Jesus Christ: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. 
As you prophesy before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings: may this book be like the little book of Revelation 10 when eaten makes the belly bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey.
Your fellow servant and of your brethren and father in the faith that have the testimony of Jesus.
