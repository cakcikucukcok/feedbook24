      <meta name="description" content="This book is an ambitious blue print of ideas to unite all the people of the world according to the divine teachings of peace and Tawhid (an Arabic word for unity and universalism). The divine teachings of peace and Tawhid are universal teachings and practices of Islam. They apply to all people of all religions, in all compartments of their lives. The main purpose of the divine teachings of peace and Tawhid is to establish the all truth, one reality and purity of the universe. These teachings do not only combine the true teaching of all the books and prophets of God, but they also combine all the true teachings of all the compartments of our lives, secular and religious. This book is written in the Islamic context, and extols and persuades the Muslim society to return to the basis and cornerstone of Islamthat is, to establish peace and unity and one brotherhood. Furthermore, this book is not only for the Muslims since peace and unity is a universal concept. Every personwhether Christian, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, or from any other religionis looking for peace, and what better way to attain this peace than by uniting and unifying all people of all religions of the world." />
