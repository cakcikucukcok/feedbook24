  <title>Believe in the Supreme Creator - Dr. Kalu Ndukwe Nchege</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Believe in the Supreme Creator&lt;/i&gt; is a book about hope, trust, and belief in God. It follows the life of Dinah and her relationship with Kalson. They are faced with disappointments, betrayal, and challenges. They learn to submit to God and walk with Him in faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nchege weaves a story about God and religion using biblical references and African idioms to demonstrate the power of belief and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an inspiring and enjoyable book by my old friend from my Nigeria days, Dr. Kalu Nchege. I am amazed and thrilled by the way he has been able to show that in all circumstances there is a Scriptural admonition or promise, if when trusted in, brings answers and blessings and a resolution to the situation. Here is hope, encouragement, and instruction for any reader who really wants to know the Supreme Creator who is revealed in the Holy Scriptures Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rev. Z. D. Reece&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this narrative, Dr. Nchege is able to depict the need for each of us to believe in the Supreme Creator. Only one who has gotten to know how gracious and merciful God is could have delivered a piece of literature like this. Such a remarkable way to let the world know regardless of nationality, ethnic origin, or religious denomination style of worshipping, God loves each of us unconditionally and we must love Him back and be born of the Spirit of God.&lt;/p&gt;
