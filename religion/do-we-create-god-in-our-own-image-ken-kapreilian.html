  <title>Do We Create God in Our Own Image? - Ken Kapreilian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Newly revised for 2017.    The title of this book is a play on words from the following scripture. &quot; So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.&quot; (Genesis 1:27)  In this book we will explore the many different ways in which our view of God is influenced and thus created.   If a person believes that they are created in the image of God, then they will act, think and behave accordingly. Conversely if a person believes otherwise (Darwinism) then they will also act, think and behave accordingly.   Therefore, a person&#39;s thinking and behavior is directly related to what they believe about whose image they were created in.     To find the answer to the question of; &quot;Do We Create God In Our Our Image?&quot; is the reason I have written this book. I invite you to explore this very fascinating subject with me." />
