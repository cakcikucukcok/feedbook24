  <title>Chances Are... - Marie Laure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They say Life is a journey, but how many of us take the time to pay attention to the sites? Sometimes the best invitation to discover ones own path is to slip into the mystery of anothers. Marie Laures Chances Are . . . offers readers a window into the spiritual exploration of a soul moving through everyday life. On the way, one quickly realizes how intricately woven sacred moments are in the mundane, like riding the subway, sitting in class, and in getting lost. And one easily discovers connections and echoes from the page to ones own life. In that way, this story grows beyond a mere window into a compelling invitation.
 Reverend Gregory Morisse 
Senior Pastor, The Plymouth Church in Framingham, MA 
The United Church of Christ 
Marie Laures recognition of God -- whom she calls the Presence -- at an early age is prescient and powerful.Her description of continuing to love, even those whom we think we have lost, hits home for anyone who has suffered the death of a loved one or the indifference of intimates. Her story is a must read for anyone struggling to make meaning of an insufficient inherited religion and finding a new way forward in faith.
