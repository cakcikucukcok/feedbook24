  <title>The Trilogy of Miracle Flowers - Kristi Hurley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Six secret lives. Miracle Flowers cannot pretend to believe in all that she has ever known. There is an evil that has presented itself--one that has been sheltered from her all of her life, but now she must confront that evil. With the help from a stranger and his father she and her family seek refuge and freedom as more subtle-turned-blatant threats surround them, placing them in even greater danger. Freedom, liberty, and justice for all. All things of the past in the society implemented by the Federation of United Loyalists and the system imposed by the Compass Party hierarchy. Sadly, no remnants of the United States exist since the last 70 years. The Ghost Girl, Miracle Flowers, hidden from the rest of the world for 17 years, now out of the shadows and unknowingly leading a revolution among a community of misfits. Now labeled a fugitive and a criminal by the government, the General and those beneath him lead a search for the Ghost Girl. No one is safe. There is nowhere to hide...or is there?" />
