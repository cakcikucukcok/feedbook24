  <title>Continuing in Christ’S Teaching - Moffat D. Ngalande</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My increasing desire is to see Christians that have a holistic view of the
Christian faith, being fi rmly grounded in the truths of Gods Word.
Continuing in Christs Teaching takes you on a journey in which the
fundamental Christian doctrines are explored so that we may grasp them and
not only grasp them, but also apply and continue in them in practical day to
day living.
-Moff at Ngalande.
Many of the books and papers in almost all fi elds of study are normally written by so-called
giants and heavyweights in their fi eld. Yet many times, because of this very fact, much of what
is written tends to be very intellectual. It seems to be out of touch with the normal day to day
hassles of life that the average human being has to face. Many of the other books written by
lightweights in the fi eld seem to lack orderliness and the depth of thought that is required.
Yet in this book Continuing in Christs teaching, Moff at works out a unique combination
of the best of both worlds.
I thus proudly recommend this book to Christians of all denominations.
-Reverend Reynold Mmangisa - Church of Central Africa Presbyterian
A very good and well researched eff ort. Th e fact that this is done by a young lay and
professional person should be both encouraging and challenging. Encouraging because its a
very good sign in the midst of the (diff erent) extremes in teachings and doctrines. Challenging
because it shows that there is a quiet which must be recognized and addressed
-Pastor Jeremiah Chikhwaza - Bible Faith Ministries
Th is is an excellent work which elaborates the biblical doctrines herein discussed. Many
readers, both growing and mature Christians would fi nd this book both informative and
helpful in attaining a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of the Christian faith.
