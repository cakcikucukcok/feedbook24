  <title>A Preview of Jesus’S Seminal Teachings and Leadership - Isaac Kinuthia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Preview of Jesuss Seminal Teachings and Leadership opens the pages of the four gospels, sharing their witness with devoted Bible students and inquisitive readers. It highlights the essential messages of Jesuss instructions for his followers and the central examples of his leadership for all who desire to obtain eternal life through his death and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building upon years of personal study of the Scriptures and years of living as a Christian, Isaac Kinuthia brings to bear his background growing up in Kenya and studying and living in the United States as he shares a summary of Jesuss words and deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compactly written chapters address a variety of topics, including the lordship of Jesus, the promise of heaven, Jesuss take on the Bible, the Ten Commandments, loving others, the sanctity of life, the power of prayer, the challenges presented by evil spirits, the reality of judgment, and Jesus second coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Preview of Jesuss Seminal Teachings and Leadership provides a thumbnail sketch of Jesuss essential teachings and his acts of leadership for devoted Bible students and individuals drawn to the only man who defeated death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
