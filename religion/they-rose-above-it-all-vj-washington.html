  <title>&quot;They Rose Above It All&quot; - Vj Washington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This author writes about the ups and downs of families going through many trials and tribulations. Their situations are not unique, yet some may never tell what they face for fear of retaliation. 
There are many similarities in all of the situations involving each of these young people that can happen in your family. On any given day, you may find yourself in one of their situations.
But know this,  you can and will make it through, if you faint not. Press on, God is always in control and He will surely pull you through.
These three young people went through trials, tribulations and now triumphs.  All because they recognized a higher being. They had the love, bond and strength of family unity.  And by the Grace of God, they never gave up.  They each can testify to the outcome of their own situation.  To God be the Glory.
Much Love,
VJ Washington, Author" />
