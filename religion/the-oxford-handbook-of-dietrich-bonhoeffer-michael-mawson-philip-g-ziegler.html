  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Dietrich Bonhoeffer - Michael Mawson, Philip G. Ziegler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume provides a comprehensive resource for those wishing to understand the German theologian, pastor, and resistance conspirator Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) and his writings. During his lifetime he made important contributions to many of the major areas of theology: ecclesiology, creation, Christology, discipleship, and ethics. The Oxford Handbook of Dietrich Bonhoeffer surveys, assesses, and presents the field of research and debates of
Bonhoeffer and his legacy, as well as of previous Bonhoeffer scholarship. Featuring contributions from leading Bonhoeffer scholars, historians, theologians, and ethicists, many essays draw attention to Bonhoeffer&#39;s positive contributions, while several essays also identify limits and problems with his thinking as it
stands.
Divided into five parts, the first section provides a detailed outline of Bonhoeffer&#39;s biography and the contexts that gave rise to his theology. The contributors explore the dynamic relationship between Bonhoeffer&#39;s life and theology. Section two provides rigorous engagements with and assessments of Bonhoeffer&#39;s theology on its own terms. Part three demonstrates how Bonhoeffer&#39;s ethical claims and engagements are deeply integrated with theological commitments. The fourth section showcases some
of the best work drawing upon Bonhoeffer for engaging contemporary challenges, including feminism, race, public theology in South Africa, and contemporary philosophy. In recent decades, Bonhoeffer&#39;s theology has provoked significant critical reflection on social and cultural issues. The essays in
this section exemplify how his writings can continue to contribute to such reflection today. The fifth and final section consists of essays on resources for the contemporary study of Bonhoeffer and his theology, including sources and texts, biographies and portraits, and readings and receptions. These essays also address pressing historiographical issues and problems surrounding writing about Bonhoeffer&#39;s life and theology. This authoritative collection draws together and assesses the very best
of existing research on Bonhoeffer and promotes new avenues for research on Bonhoeffer." />
