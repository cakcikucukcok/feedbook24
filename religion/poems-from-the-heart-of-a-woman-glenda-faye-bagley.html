  <title>Poems from the Heart of a Woman - Glenda Faye Bagley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My mother, Lovella Bagley had ten children. She taught her family about Jesus and the biblical principles of His word. Her dream was to write a book about her husband and all her children. She was married to Lee Earnest Bagley, Sr. for sixty-five years; he went home to be with the Lord on December 12, 2009. My father had a good sense of humor and an extraordinary personality. He provided for his family by working at an apartment complex as a Supervisor of Plumbing- in Lubbock, Texas. In my upcoming book, &lt;em&gt;Why am I Here?&lt;/em&gt;I will talk about specifics in our familys life. Our mother was diagnosed with Alzheimers at the age of seventy-five and I watched her sad face as the doctor gave her the news. I watched her go from a vibrant woman to being in a wheelchair. She was determined to finish writing her poetry in her journal because she was quickly losing her memory. Her impeding illness did not discourage her even though she continued to struggle to remember names, events and wording. Every night she wrote poems and short stories in her journal that she kept in a silver briefcase. Some years passed and my siblings and I became her caregivers. Throughout the years, I thought about that silver briefcase as our family had relocated to Dallas, Texas. My brother Rodney decided to take a trip to Lubbock, Texas to visit relatives. During his visit, Rodney went to his storage to get furniture and other items to take back to Dallas. As he walked through the storage he looked next to a wall and there laid the silver briefcase that held my mothers poems. I was so excited; I knewthere has to be a reason for us findingthe silver briefcase. In my book, &lt;em&gt;Poems from the Heart of a Woman&lt;/em&gt; it presents poetry written by my mother as well as myself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
