  <title>Elders and Deacons and Saints, Oh My! - James Kirkland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Elders and Deacons and Saints, Oh My!&lt;/i&gt; shares the Bibles teachings on leadership and organization. It offers members of todays churches the insights needed to fulfill the five purposes God gives: to love Him, love others, evangelize, identify new followers, and make them faithful disciples. Author James Kirkland, a pastor and theologian with deep experience as a business owner and CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Professional, weaves together organizational wisdom and biblical teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Through a study of the Scriptures, &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Elders and Deacons and Saints, Oh My!&lt;/i&gt; defines the roles of the churchs leaders and presents the Bibles model for organizing congregations. It paints a picture of servant leaders, grounds their authority in biblical teaching, and guides them in assembling faithful teams of ministers who practice loving care for others, following the model of Christs love for all people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you find yourself listening to Gods call to the church, but then growing disappointed at how your congregation answers that call, then &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Elders and Deacons and Saints, Oh My!&lt;/i&gt; can help you become a stronger leader. It combines scripturally inspired teaching about leaders and church administration with practical methods for building and leading teams. You will gain understanding about the strengths of clearly defined roles for elders, deacons, and church members and the power for mission that comes when leaders organize Gods people around those roles. In the end, your disappointment can turn to joy through encouraging members toward Christian maturity and equipping them to share Christs love with others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
