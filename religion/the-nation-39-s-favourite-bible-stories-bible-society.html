  <title>The Nation&#39;s Favourite Bible Stories - Bible Society</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So many Bible stories are part of our culture, education and literature and now, following a nationwide poll, the favourite best-loved stories, passages and verses are brought together in this unique collection.
The story of Noah, the nativity, the last supper, Samson and Delilah and other favourite Bible stories can be enjoyed as they were originally intended in the words of the Bible.
Accompanying the passages are interesting facts and statistics as well as contributions from The Rt Hon David Cameron MP, Cardinal Vincent Nichols and Most Revd Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury.
Read an old favourite or discover a new gem in The Nation’s Favourite Bible Stories.
“There are so many inspiring, stirring and comforting passages in the Bible and it is never easy to choose one over others, but one that I am particularly fond of is Philippians, chapter 4, verses 8 and 9, from the King James Version. To me this passage calls on us to follow God’s example and put into practice Jesus’ teachings by leading good, honest, selfless, loving, responsible and compassionate lives; helping each other as best we can.”
The Rt Hon David Cameron MP (from The Nation’s Favourite Bible Stories)
