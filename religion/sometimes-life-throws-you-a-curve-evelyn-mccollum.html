  <title>Sometimes Life Throws You a Curve - Evelyn McCollum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At times when I was so sick I wondered if God had forsaken me, and that the prayers were not getting through. That was when I felt like Job, but like Job, I was determined to continue to trust. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. If I renounced my faith, turned my back on God, where else could I go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also remembered the passage in Johns Gospel: After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him. Jesus said to the twelve, Will you also go away? Simon Peter answered him, Where shall we go? You have the words of eternal life; so we have believed and have come to know you, that you are the Holy One of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my faith has remained intact throughout this ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
