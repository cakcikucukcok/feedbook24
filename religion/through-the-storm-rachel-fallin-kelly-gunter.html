  <title>Through the Storm - Rachel Fallin, Kelly Gunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young love and betrayal. 
Zach and Samantha were high school sweethearts until one night changed everything. Over the course of seventy-two hours, life continued to drown Samantha with unimaginable tragedies, forcing her to forsake her hometown and the people she loves. 
Seven years later, she&#39;s back to help her town rebuild after a storm devastated it. She is forced to face her past, including the admission to her shattered faith and beliefs. What she least expected were the emotions and feelings that resurfaced, especially when she discovers Zachs life has also been drastically changed. Will love break down all barriers and heal two wounded hearts? Will they rely on God and each other to make it through the storms of life?" />
