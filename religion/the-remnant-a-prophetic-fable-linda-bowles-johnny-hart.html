  <title>The Remnant: A Prophetic Fable - Linda Bowles, Johnny Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Linda Bowles employs caustic satire skillfully to advocate a return to the principles of common sense and human decency. The fable takes place in 2046 when political correctness has developed a chokehold on all American institutions. The Constitution-determined to be hopelessly outdated&amp;ndash;has been banished to a museum. Fulfilling quotas of racial, gender, sexual-preference, and assorted other categories is the primordial function of every aspect of public policy. Religion is virtually outlawed. The Democrat and Republican parties have converged into one self-perpetuating organization&amp;ndash;the Demopubs, and all that made America great is abased, ridiculed, or obliterated. So removed from rectitude has the nation become that God appears to the President with a warning to get back on the right track.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who seek out symbolism will find many characters named after Biblical players. The President&amp;#39;s name is Moses Jones, the first lady is Sheba, and the vice-president who faces a few figurative giants is given the first name of David. No allegorical appellation is as humorously utilized as Judith Ischcarot who serves as a de facto atheism czar in the cabinet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of this short work is risibly sapient, but late in chapter eight, it takes a major detour into stirring eloquence. When President Moses Jones addresses his cabinet and admits that he experienced a Theophany, his remarks are profound. Were this peroration a genuine speech delivered by a real president, it would take its place not too far beneath George Washington&amp;#39;s farewell or the Gettysburg Address. The penetrating sinew is constant throughout the nearly two page soliloquy and is represented by lines like &amp;quot;we decided sin and guilt are burdens we don&amp;#39;t have to carry. In effect, the rules governing our behavior can be whatever we want them to be...In an environment permissive of uninhibited expression, we did not find the inherent wisdom within our souls; we found the inherent barbarism.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the parable takes place 40+ years in the future, most of it is applicable today. When President Jones declaims, &amp;quot; we used to fight our demons...now we embrace them, &amp;quot; his words ring as true in 2001 as the do in the era of Demopubs. Perhaps &amp;quot;The Remnant&amp;quot; can serve as a much needed wake-up call. It is far less drastic that a visit from above conveying divine displeasure." />
