  <title>Models of Leadership in the Adab Narratives of Joseph, David, and Solomon - Sami Helewa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span style=&quot;s book opens anew the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Qi?a? al-anbiy?? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Tales of the Prophets) in terms of the leadership of ancient prophets in a Muslim context of friendship and enmity in the narrative detail of the prophets Joseph, David, and Solomon. Although the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Qi?a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; genre is not court-based, advice literature, these tales could function as advisory literature through the legendary-prophetic figures. It is hardly surprising that the prophets of ancient times have been moral prototypes for the Judo-Islamic search for religio-political leaders. However, the themes of leadership, friends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hip, and enmity are embedded in these tales in the writing of great Medieval-Muslims like al-?abar? of Baghd?d and al-Tha?lab? of N?sh?p?r, who were great scholars (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;?ulam??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and men of literature (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;?udab??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;). Like the religious side of these tales, Helewa maintains that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;adab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; side of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Qi?a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; has equal importance of meaning to the struggle of ancient prophets in their friendships and hostilities. These tales, as astutely compiled from Baghd?d and N?sh?p?r, mirror interesting cultural nuances of expected l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;eadership inherent in these great cities of learning. This book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; will be a great value for those interested in the S?ra genre, the overall &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Qi?a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; genre, the inheritance of prophets, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;adab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of religious writing, the advice literature, a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nd the history of Baghd?d and N?sh?p?r.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />

    	<p>Qi?a? al-anbiy?? (Tales of the Prophets) in terms of the leadership of ancient prophets in a Muslim context of friendship and enmity in the narrative detail of the prophets Joseph, David, and Solomon. Although the Qi?a? genre is not court-based, advice literature, these tales could function as advisory literature through the legendary-prophetic figures. It is hardly surprising that the prophets of ancient times have been moral prototypes for the Judo-Islamic search for religio-political leaders. However, the themes of leadership, friendship, and enmity are embedded in these tales in the writing of great Medieval-Muslims like al-?abar? of Baghd?d and al-Tha?lab? of N?sh?p?r, who were great scholars (?ulam??) and men of literature (?udab??). Like the religious side of these tales, Helewa maintains that the adab side of the Qi?a? has equal importance of meaning to the struggle of ancient prophets in their friendships and hostilities. These tales, as astutely compiled from Baghd?d and N?sh?p?r, mirror interesting cultural nuances of expected leadership inherent in these great cities of learning. This book will be a great value for those interested in the S?ra genre, the overall Qi?a? genre, the inheritance of prophets, the adab of religious writing, the advice literature, and the history of Baghd?d and N?sh?p?r.</p>
