  <title>Take My Hand: A Theological Memoir: Group Study Edition - Andrew Taylor-Troutman, Paul Galbreath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take My Hand is an invitation to experience a year of preaching through the eyes of a first-year pastor. Andrew Taylor-Troutman reflects on his experience of ministry as a dynamic exchange between his theological education and the people in the pews. Each chapter consists of Taylor-Troutman&#39;s reflections about a particular aspect of living as a faith community and concludes with a sermon exploring similar themes and ideas. As this book journeys through the Christian liturgical year, Taylor-Troutman considers a wide range of contemporary church issues, including the role of children in worship and the communal practice of Sabbath. He discusses topics as diverse as the Rapture, the death penalty, and church league softball. Along the way, readers will laugh at Sunday morning bloopers, study biblical texts from new perspectives, wrestle with theological questions, and discover parallels between their own experience of faith and the life of this small rural congregation. More than just a retrospective summary of events, Take My Hand poignantly illustrates how a pastor&#39;s work on Sunday morning grows out of his or her engagement with the hopes and fears of daily life, and the inspiring faith of men, women, and children in a church.  The Group Study Edition encourages people of different ages and experiences to discuss and enjoy the book, while applying insights to their own communities of faith." />
