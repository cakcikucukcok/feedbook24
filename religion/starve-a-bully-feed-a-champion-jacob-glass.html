  <title>Starve a Bully, Feed a Champion - Jacob Glass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy. It can be the center of miracles, or of madness. It can be a place of truth, or a place of lies; it can be an environment of peaceful contemplation, or of desperate painful isolation. The choice is ours to make. No one else is thinking in our heads. As one classic horror movie proclaims, The calls are coming from inside the house! With all the talk in the world about bullying, the one thing that is rarely considered is that the most vicious monster, the most insidious bully, who is out to terrorize, torment us and steal our joy, is not so much out there in the schools or the workplace or the neighborhood. The bully we cannot seem to escape from is the one living inside our own heads. In Starve a Bully, Feed a Champion, Jacob Glass and his spirit guides take the reader through a gentle 101 day spiritual boot camp to guide the mind away from the tormenting thoughts of the ego and toward the peaceful, joyous and loving thoughts which lead to freedom and peace of mind. Based on the principles of A Course in Miracles and other New Thought teachings, the goal of this boot camp is the attainment of inner peace under any and all circumstances. You were not meant to merely survive, but to thrive!&lt;/p&gt;" />
