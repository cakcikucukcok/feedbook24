  <title>A Redemptive Theology of Art - David A. Covington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Redemptive Theology of Art &lt;/em&gt;develops a biblical, systematic, and practical theology of aesthetics. It begins with the roots and ontology of aesthetics (vs. &quot;art&quot;) and the architecture and narrative of affection and passion, their woes and their glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who would search the Bible find little support for &quot;art&quot; as commonly conceived in the West. The language of aesthetics, applied to the maker&amp;rsquo;s intentions, the qualities of the work, and the responses of the audience, better addresses the questions of beauty, and better suits the discussion of human actions, beliefs, and culture than the language of art does. The Bible yields more consistent and helpful answers to questions about the broader category of aesthetics than it does to questions about art; leading in turn to better questions and a more practical and theological appreciation of human affections, beauty, and delight, and the many paths by which people, including Christians, pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the categories and definitions from Scripture, Covington gives hope and help not only for those who labor in the arts, but for everyone who cares about the passions that motivate us. We were made for God&#39;s delight, and, though sin and bondage plague our passions, God can shape our fun, feelings, desires, affections and aversions. Feelings are neither objective nor subjective; they are redeemable. Borrowing key ideas from other Christian writers on the arts or aesthetics, Covington explores the connection between orthodox Protestant theology and a responsible, respectful treatment of arts, artists, and all aesthetic fields of human work and speech.&lt;/p&gt;" />
