  <title>ReFocus - Jim Daly, Paul Batura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Written by Jim Daly, the compassionate leader of Focus on the Family, &lt;EM&gt;ReFocus&lt;/EM&gt; inspires and motivates Christians to transcend political agendas and partisan battles and instead interact with others in a way that will consistently reveal the heart of God to a desperately hurting world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our culture has become painfully polarized, often hindering relationships with neighbors, colleagues, and the very people who need to discover the love of Jesus Christ. Remembering that we are foremost citizens of heaven serving a loving Father, we who call ourselves followers of Christ can once again be known by our love.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But how? In what context and through what means? How can we tear down the walls that divide our culture, our neighborhoods and workplaces and families, in this increasingly contentious world?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drawing on a rich variety of true stories and sources both historical and contemporary—from behind the scenes in today’s halls of power,&amp;nbsp; to moving accounts from church history, to powerful breakthrough’s in Daly’s own life and ministry—Daly challenges us to reclaim our responsibility, and our privilege, as God’s sons and daughters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As followers of Jesus with his humility and compassion as our model, ReFocus&lt;EM&gt;: Living a Life that Reflects God’s Heart&lt;/EM&gt; demonstrates how Christians can show the world an inexplicable taste of grace with no agenda other than to reveal the heart of God as the loving Abba father he is.&lt;/P&gt;" />
