  <title>Rusty - Cindy Devereaux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My little doga heartbeat at my feet. Edith Wharton
This story begins in Brooklyn, New York.
Rusty, a terrier-chow mix, could be described as a family member, loyal companion, teacher, best friend, and quite possibly, the neighborhood mascot.
If the proverb it takes a village to raise a child could be paraphrased and dog substituted for child, it would describe Rustys relationship with his neighbors. They looked after him as if he were their own  giving him walks, rides, play dates, and treats.
His owners adored him. 
Children made sure to visit him every day on their way home from schooland on those rare occasions when he ran away, search parties were formed to bring him back home.
He was known for his playfulness and sweet disposition. When family members had emotional challenges, he stayed by their sides.
A channeled message from Archangel Michael, at an International Angel Day workshop, said: Dont worry about Rusty; the angels are looking after him.
The reason for this message became clear two years later when Rustys idyllic lifestyle was surprisingly interrupted. That situation was turned around when one of his owners remembered to call on the angels. 
They answered, saved him, and fulfilled Archangel Michaels promise. 
That is why his story is called &quot;Rusty - A Dog and His Angels.&quot;" />
