  <title>For a New Generation - Lee D. Kricher, Andy Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A New Generation Church is a church with attendees whose average age is at least as young as the average age of the community in which the church exists. Any church can become a New Generation Church that reaches and continues to reach the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Psalmist writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will not hide these truths from our children; we will tell the next generation about the glorious deeds of the Lord, about his power and his mighty wonders. (Psalm 78:4 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Christian would purposely hide the timeless truths of Christianity from the next generation. But often we do, not because of the substance of our church, but because of the approach of our church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For A New Generation is not about changing your church&amp;rsquo;s statement of faith or core beliefs. It is about evaluating and changing, as needed, your church&amp;rsquo;s programs, ministries and practices in order to more effectively connect with and stay connected with the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written for both church leaders and members, For a New Generation presents 5 practical strategies that will lay a foundation for a church to thrive for generations to come. It is based on the assumption that accepting the status quo is the greatest threat to your church&amp;rsquo;s core mission and, perhaps, to the long-term survival of your church.&lt;/p&gt;" />
