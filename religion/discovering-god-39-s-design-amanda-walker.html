  <title>Discovering God&#39;s Design - Amanda Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discovering Gods Design answers the call for a resource that any woman can use to help her reexamine her view of womanhood according to Scripture. Walker leads us, as women, on a journey to embrace the wonderful truth that being called woman, according to Gods design, is an essential aspect of our identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Terri Stovall (PhD), Dean of Womens Programs and Associate Professor of Womens Ministries at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Discovering Gods Design is a six-week Bible study for women of all ages. In a world where feminism and political correctness have threatened to undermine Gods design for a woman, her family, and her ministry, Discovering Gods Design provides biblical guidelines on how to live out the unique calling God has placed on each womans life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beginning in Genesis, you will explore how God crafted Adam and Eve to be His image bearers in the world. God, in His infinite wisdom, created men and women to complement each other. He designed Adam to be the leader, provider, and protector of Eve, and He designed Eve to be Adams helpmate. However, with the introduction of sin in Genesis 3, man and woman have continued to struggle in their relationships with each other and the world. But there is good news. God provided an answer to the constant tension by offering us salvation through Jesus Christ. Jesuss death, burial, and resurrection did not remove the God-given gender distinctions. Instead, it restored them. Women are now free to discover what it means to be an image bearer, how He has gifted each woman for a specific task, and then provided an opportunity, within the boundaries of scripture, to accomplish the task set before them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have wondered what it means to be a biblical woman, then look no further. Discovering Gods Design is for you!&lt;/p&gt;" />
