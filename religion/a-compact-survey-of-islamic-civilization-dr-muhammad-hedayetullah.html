  <title>A Compact Survey of Islamic Civilization - Dr. Muhammad Hedayetullah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Islam is one of the Semitic Religions thus one of the greatest religions of the world, and it is not easy to present a complete description of this religion in a Compact Survey, as this book is.

For that, one needs to have a complete understanding of the principal institution of Islam. A compact exposition of Muslim institutions covers at least important aspects of Arab-Muslim life. Keeping in mind these facts, I have tried to deal with the origin, background, and the rise of Islam; the dogmas and the superstitions of the faith; the sources and  practice of Muslim law, the  family life; and Sufism.

Orphaned early, he grew up under the care of his nearest relatives. His father had already died so he was brought up  by his nearest relativeshis grandfather aand his uncle. He was a shepherd during his boyhood age. It is also reported that unlike other boys, Muhammad was thoughtful, rather than playful. At the age of about twenty-five, he became the business adviser of a famed widow named Khadija, who was fifteen years his senior. Eventually he became her third husband.
