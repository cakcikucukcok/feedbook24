  <title>The Gift of Trans-Heritance - Randolph E. Okonkwo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The awareness of the spiritual powers of the infinite God is embedded within the finite plane of mankind. The Gift of Trans-Heritance delves into the awareness of these spiritual powers.
The image and likeness of God comes with many other precious gifts transferred to mankind in spirit. Mankind inherited tremendous power that comes with the infinitude of the Spirit of God.
Mankind is alive in abundance of all the gifts given to him from the Infinite Council of Eternal Deliberations (The council of the three Godhead). The best democratic principles is embedded in the image and likeness of God. And more so, our lives and science of it is beyond the human comprehension.
In the expression of God, nothing is hidden. He shows himself that who he is. God has no flaw in all he does including his creations. His infinitude is the exact unlimited power that he is. The same infinite power is expressed to finitude in the image and likeness of God in spirit.
There is only one spirit, one God and the same one spirit who lives in all people. This spirit has no fear of any kind and will never have one. The material man has fear for man lives and believes in matter not spirit. Where there is no fear, there will be no doubt of any kind. The belief in this spirit and awareness of this spirit within you, rules out any doubt, for if you establish oneness with this spirit you will always have confidence in faith. Doubt is opposite of faith, and the two can never coexist.
When we depend with faithfulness and humbleness on He who made us in His image and likeness, we would have crossed over to the stage of life in its fullness." />
