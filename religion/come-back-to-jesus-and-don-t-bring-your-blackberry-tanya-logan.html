  <title>Come Back to Jesus—And Don’T Bring Your Blackberry - Tanya Logan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you drifted away from the faith? Or has life gotten in the way? Whether your time is cluttered by busyness, relationships, hurts, or addictions, you can reach new dimensions through reading and reflection as you study &lt;i&gt;Come Back to Jesus&lt;/i&gt;. Dig deep into Scripture to find the answers that are already there waiting for you. Share more fully in the life of Christ. God wants to spend time with you; Hes already waiting for your response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Come Back to Jesus&lt;/i&gt; offers a powerful, renewing experience that builds on the gifts God gave you for ministry. First, you will explore your life to find the time-stealers that keep you from worshipping God as much as you would like. Next, youll be able to root them out and start afresh with prayer, centering yourself in the Word. You can explore our wrong desires, things that could lead you back off the narrow path. Youll have a chance to open up to God and practice being in His presence, remembering when He has been especially real for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience the love of the Lord like you may never have before. Read the book as a personal growth guide, or use it as a six-week Bible study, and share insights and encouragement with your small group.&lt;/p&gt;" />
