  <title>Passed Away - Jana Dohnalova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is book about the process of destruction. The cemetery is a place where it is possible to watch the process of destruction like a movie through the peephole of a nickelodeon. In the cemetery, the process of destruction comes into being and when we take a photo herefor example, of memorials or flowerswe flick through these photos, starting from fresh flowers and finishing with dead stalks inside the vase. Browsing, through these pictures quickly, suddenly we see a movie, a movie of destruction.
The cemetery is a place where the process of destruction is absolute; here is the destruction of everything, not only the human body, but of absolutely everything that is in the cemetery at that time. Here everything ispassed away.
What is destruction? Everything old has been destroyed so something new can start. Destruction is a condition for a beginning to start, and the first without the second is not possible. Can two processes change everything around, starting the basic cycle of emotional reactionsadness and happiness?
Nobody is indifferent to the process of destruction. The process starts a lot of emotional reactions such as crying and anger and belief, because we dont want to reconcile ourselves to it, but also we dont have a lot of power to fight it." />
