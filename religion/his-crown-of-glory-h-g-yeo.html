  <title>His Crown of Glory - H G Yeo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book came about when the Holy Spirit brought to my mind a vision, which I saw during one of my counselling sessions some time back. As my counsellor and I were discussing about some specific issues in my life that needed healing, I saw Jesus coming into the room and gently drawing out a broken part from my innermost being. 
I recognised this broken part immediately. She had short hair and was wearing long black pants and a long-sleeved white shirt. She had been feeling miserable all her life as she had carried a deep hatred in her heart toward her father. He had behaved as though he only had a son but not a daughter. I had earlier on introduced this part to Jesus during one of my quiet moments before going for counselling. She refused to listen to me. She said that all men are the same. I told her that Jesus is differentthat he longed to woo her, heal her, and take the place of her father who was never a father to her. She was adamant, so I told her to take some time to consider." />
