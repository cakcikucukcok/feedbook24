      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Miracles are happening in and throughout&amp;nbsp;our lives every day and in fact, they abound. This writing,&lt;strong&gt; Miracles Abounds&lt;/strong&gt;, captures this reality for the reader to explore. Establishing&lt;strong&gt; the reality of miracles in a contemporary&amp;nbsp;context &lt;/strong&gt;it provides both the foundational background for the existence of miracles and their current practical&amp;nbsp;application to one&amp;#39;s life. The author offers &lt;strong&gt;a new perspective&lt;/strong&gt; to the understanding and definition of what miracles are and how they can and should be understood. Noting the historical perspective he gives a fresh focus to the current reality of miracles bringing this truth to full life in real time for the reader. It&amp;#39;s no longer just an intellectual concept but an enlivened empirical reality for one&amp;#39;s contemporary&amp;nbsp;living; from &lt;strong&gt;concept into life experience&lt;/strong&gt;.In this way the author &lt;strong&gt;opens a great new window&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;for the reader to enter; to &lt;strong&gt;explore&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and grow.&lt;/strong&gt; Aspects of the dynamics of miracles are offered in areas such as; &lt;strong&gt;hope, healing, provision, new beginnings, inner strength &lt;/strong&gt;and more.

He invites others into the conversation&amp;nbsp;and shares their stories connecting the dots between the various applications of miracles and their meaning to real life. This leads the reader on a path into a real and &lt;strong&gt;current life of miraculous living&lt;/strong&gt;. No longer should miracles be&amp;nbsp;seen as isolated events but as part of one&amp;#39;s continual experience of life. To enhance the reader&amp;#39;s personal growth in this new learning the author&lt;strong&gt; offers practical applications and methods for engagement&lt;/strong&gt;. This new awareness is not only possible but is shown in factual and empirical reality throughout the writing. The author declares,&lt;strong&gt; &amp;quot;In a state of miraculous living this reality becomes the force of one&amp;#39;s daily existence.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; Not only is it an&lt;strong&gt; engaging and heart moving&lt;/strong&gt; read, it shows the way to greater life fulfillment, presents this reality in empirical form and leaves the reader satisfied&amp;nbsp;that they too can accomplish what the author has declared and demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;" />
