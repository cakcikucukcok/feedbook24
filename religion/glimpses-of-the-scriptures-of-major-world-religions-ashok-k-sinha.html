  <title>Glimpses of the Scriptures of Major World Religions - Ashok K. Sinha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, A COLLECTION OF EXCERPTS FROM THE SCRIPTURES OF MAJOR WORLD RELIGIONS, consists of three major Parts.  PART  I (adopted from an earlier book by the author) pertains to major religions that originated in INDIA at different epochs of history; namely, HINDUISM, BUDDHISM, JAINISM, and SIKHISM.  PART   I I contains excerpts   from the main scriptures of the three religions that originated in European and the Middle Eastern regions with their original roots in Prophet Abraham, namely, JUDAISM, CHRISTIANITY, And ISLAM.  Thus, PART  I contains excerpts from the Vedas and the Upanishads (Hinduism); the Dhammapad (Buddhism); the Agam (Jainism); and the Guru Granth Saheb (Sikhism.) A number of essays on the historical backgrounds, the leading figures and events, and their interrelations are also included for a deeper appreciation of the pertinent philosophies. PART  II, similarly, contains excerpts from The Old Testament (Judaism) and The New Testament (Christianity) of the Bible, and the Koran (Islam), with a brief Introduction in each case. 
The main purpose of presenting this book is to illustrate the commonality of the Indian religions due to their common root  Hinduism -- that came into being in India some 10-15 millennia ago, and was modified from time to time. These religions have coexisted peacefully and harmoniously for centuries and millennia, and have contributed much in the global spiritual development. In particular, Buddhism has been adopted in a significant portion of Asia (China, Japan, South-East Asia), and has been also attracting the intellectuals in the West in recent years.  Interrelations among the other three religions are also evident due to their common root; though significant historical schisms and ideological differences   among them are also well-known.  As the world enters the Twentieth Century, it is imperative for world-peace that people across the globe try to understand one another better, in terms of the spiritual and religious beliefs, philosophies, mentalities, and traditional tendencies that shape their individual lives as well as their mutual interaction patterns.  It is hoped that this book makes a small contribution in that direction." />
