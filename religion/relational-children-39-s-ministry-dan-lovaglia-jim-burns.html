  <title>Relational Children&#39;s Ministry - Dan Lovaglia, Jim Burns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s ministry has the power to change the lives of kids and families. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not always clear that the work a person does with kids is really making a lasting difference. Ask children&amp;rsquo;s ministry leaders and kid-influencers if they are making the impact on children&amp;rsquo;s lives as they had hoped and most likely the responses will be mixed. And for good reason. Research over the past decade has revealed an alarming lack of long-term growth in the faith community as children progress through student ministries into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, something needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relational Children&amp;rsquo;s Ministry &lt;/em&gt;seeks to reverse this trend by equipping children&amp;rsquo;s ministry leaders with practical tools to disrupt the status quo approach to discipleship with children and realign their ministries for greater long-term impact. Ministry leaders will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn how to relate intentionally to kids and families by putting five discipleship invitations modeled by Jesus into practice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore practical approaches to realign their children&amp;rsquo;s ministry for a new trajectory by hitting three &amp;ldquo;reset buttons&amp;rdquo; to ensure long-term discipleship is embedded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encounter examples of disruptive disciple-makers in action and learn key principles that can be translated into their own ministry context&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s ministry leaders will receive practical training to refocus their children&amp;rsquo;s ministry along with time-tested tools to personally recommit to lifelong discipleship. Kid-influencers can become a disciple-making community that redirects the current trajectory for this and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
