  <title>Preaching to Empty Seats - Dr. C. Dexter Wise Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An epidemic of empty seats has broken out in churches all across America. It has infected storefront churches on side streets, mainstream churches on Main Street, and megaministries sprawling across suburban campuses on multiple streets. Every Sunday, virtually everywhere in the United States, preachers are forced to stand in the pulpit and preach to empty seats. What has caused this situation, and how can it be changed?
In this study, author C. Dexter Wise III addresses the issue of declining church attendance first by identifying nine key contributors to it, examining what these factors are and how they generate empty seats. He then goes on to offer more than one hundred concrete, practical steps that local churches can take to fill those empty seats with people on fire for the Lord, revolutionizing their entire ministries. With this guidance, which focuses on the contribution of both preachers and congregations, countless loss souls may flow into churches, full of the Word, the spirit, and the power of God.
This guide explores the reasons that churches in the United States are facing declines in attendance and offers more than one hundred practical ways to fill these empty seats again." />
