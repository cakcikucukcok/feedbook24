  <title>You&#39;ve Got to Be Kidding! - Cookie Leonardelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my goal is to learn to bear with others, be present in the moment, press in to God, and bluntly putshut up! Except of course when the next thing in my life causes me to scream, Youve got to be kidding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cookie Leonardelli has always wanted to write a book; a book that would reach people right where they were at  get into their hearts, speak to their souls and ultimately bring them healing from the pain they have experienced in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youve Got to be Kidding! is that book. Cookie begins with the story of her childhood and weaves stories from her adult life throughout the book. We learn about her fears, her hopes and dreams and the pains she has suffered. Ultimately we get to learn about her victory through her strong faith in Jesus Christ.
Cookies goal is that through her story you will learn that even though some circumstances may seem impossible to survive (like the death of a child) you will always be brought back to a place of faith, healing and victory. She hopes you will laugh, cry, but mostly that you will be able to find a place of peace in your life regardless of the challenges you have faced.
So with that in mind, you are encouraged to curl up on the couch with a blanket, bag of Cheetos (or whatever snack you prefer) and crack open this book  at the end, the expectation is that you will say to yourself Youve got to be kidding!&lt;/p&gt;" />
