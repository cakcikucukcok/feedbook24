  <title>Delighting in the Law of the Lord - Jerram Barrs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our culture has a few catch phrases: &lt;em&gt;Be who you want to be&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Do what makes you happy&lt;/em&gt;. We are told to do our own thing and follow our own rules, which often makes the Bible appear to be oppressively restrictive and hopelessly outdated, even to Christians! Responding to the misdirection of our society and misperceptions the church has of God&amp;rsquo;s law, Professor Jerram Barrs helps readers recognize the beauty in and purpose of God&amp;rsquo;s rules for living healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives. From the Old Testament to the New, Barrs demonstrates how God&amp;rsquo;s commands to his people were intended to protect them from sin and direct them in godliness. Rejecting the idea that we can earn God&amp;rsquo;s favor through good works, Barrs nevertheless highlights how God&amp;rsquo;s commands should spur us to obedience and ultimately remind us of grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
