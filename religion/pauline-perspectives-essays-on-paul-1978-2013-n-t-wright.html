  <title>Pauline Perspectives: Essays on Paul, 1978-2013 - N. T. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This companion volume to Paul and the Faithfulness of God and Paul and His Recent Interpreters brings together N.T. Wright&amp;#39;s most important and influential articles on Paul over the last 35 years. This text includes previously unpublished exegetical essays on Paul&amp;#39;s letters, specially written for this book. The book begins with N. T. Wright&amp;#39;s auspicious essay of 1978, when as a young, aspiring scholar he gave the annual Tyndale lecture in Cambridge, and proposed, for the first time, &amp;#39;a new perspective&amp;#39; on Pauline theology. The book ends with an expanded version of a paper he gave in Leuven in 2012, when as a seasoned scholar at the height of his powers he explored the foundational role of Abraham in Romans and Galatians. In all, the thirty-three articles published here provide a rich feast for all students of Paul, both seasoned and aspiring. Each one will amply reward those looking for detailed, incisive and exquisitely nuanced exegesis, resulting in a clearer, deeper and more informed appreciation of Paul&amp;#39;s great theological achievement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
