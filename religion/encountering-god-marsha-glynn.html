      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We can all form an unbreakable bond with God. But to do so, we must first enter into a deep and lasting relationship with him. Read, ponder, and pray for guidance from God. Seek to grow in knowledge and understanding of his ways. Then apply lessons from the Bible to our daily routines. Commit to Gods love, grace, and wisdom. Be inspired by his word in the Bible, and draw closer to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Encountering God, author Marsha Glynn offers daily reflections that will help fellow believers draw closer to God through words and deeds. After years of reaching out to God through prayer and reading the Bible, Marsha was inspired to share her heart and soul and offer a collection of Bible verses and reflections that bring reassurance of Gods never-ending love, his comfort, and the hope only he can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond that Marsha has with God is unbreakable. Learn how she developed this bond and has come to believe all things come from God. He makes good come from every experience. We can all be transformed by his love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
