  <title>Unfolding Revelation - William Edward Dewberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelation 12:7-9&lt;/i&gt; And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 21:25-28&lt;/i&gt; And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring; mens hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelation 19:11-14&lt;/i&gt; Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Revelation 20:10&lt;/i&gt; The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
