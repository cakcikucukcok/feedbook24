  <title>You Will Come Forth as Gold - Jessica Plaza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;YOU WILL COME FORTH AS GOLD chronicles the journey of the Author through different levels of suffering to triumph. We don&amp;#39;t often see that the suffering we endure in this life has a divine purpose to bring forth what God has placed inside us. Our response to suffering is usually complaining, discomfort, confusion and depression; but what if we change our perspective and see the purpose of being refined by the &amp;#39;Refiners Fire&amp;#39; from a heavenly perspective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we understood that our present suffering is working out within us a greater glory to be revealed in the earth realm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would our response to suffering change then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica has been through many trials, but it has all worked out for her good. This book will open your eyes to see that your value cannot be measured by the immediate circumstances you may ne facing at this moment, but by God who allows certain things to happen to shift you into purpose. Your suffering is not unto death, but is designed to realign you into a position of influence; equip and empower you to be a beacon of light and hope to countless people who are waiting for you to lead them put of their land of bondage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why we suffer is not a practical question. The real issue is, what is this suffering designed to produce in me.&lt;/p&gt;" />
