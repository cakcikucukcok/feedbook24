  <title>The Marriage Maze... Shining His Light on the Journey - Joyce Akin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex! Difficult! Overwhelming! Do these words describe your marriage or family? Life today is busy and chaotic. Divorce rates are sky-high, and families are falling apart every day. Why is this happening? Its happening because weve turned away from the relationship fundamentals, given to us by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; The Marriage Maze,&lt;/i&gt; author Joyce Akin shares her expertise as a wife of forty-five years and as a Christian. Her words will provide you with insights into the honest, day-to-day realities of being &lt;i&gt;and staying&lt;/i&gt; married. She covers several vital marriage stressors, including finances, sex, children, and in-laws. Akin also welcomes the advice of the 25 Plus Club couples who have been married for twenty-fi ve years or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You dont have to give up on your marriage. Even in times of trouble, there is hope. You arent alone. Not only have other
couples battled similar issues, but God is always waiting to guide your relationship back to a strong foundation. It is time to lean on Him; by putting His word and the word of other couples into your heart, you can turn a marriage of chaos and difficulty into one of love and peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
