  <title>Don’T Take It Personally - Irwin Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dont Take It Personally was written in hopes of having readers take a deeper look into areas where blessings may be hidden. In our lives there are occurrences that we may take for granted. The Lord sends us opportunities to grow and to be blessed. Blessings do not always come in packages that are obvious. They are often in new places we visit or new people we meet. Sometimes we walk away from someone or something that God was attempting to use to bring us closer to Him. It is imperative to look beyond our immediate comfort zones. We should also search for things that are within us or near us. We should keep our hearts open to the Lord and keep our hearts open to His promptings; He will never steer us wrongly. We understand that when God closes one door, He opens another. God also moves and removes. He prompts us to update our lives as He sees fit. God can use benign meetings with other people to give us information. There are never any accidents when we move from one place to the next. Everywhere He places us represents new challenges. The Bible was written by people who are similar to people of today. The Lord moved them from one place to another to fulfill His will. &lt;/p&gt;" />
