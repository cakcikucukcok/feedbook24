  <title>Poems Short Stories and Things Remembered - Gloria G. Blakeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection of poems short stories and things remembered from the author&#39;s years of growing up.
The poems were started when, while watching tv, I started writing down stuff about angels. The next thing I 
knew I had three poems written about angels. Things just kept going from there. The book of Ruth has always
been a favorite of mine. Before I got through writing the story about Ruth, I felt led to write the story on Ester.
A dear friend who is a retired school teacher, read these poems and stories and encouraged me to continue
and put all my writings into a book. Many of the stories are from family experiences, so, one could say they
really are true stories. I hope something in this book will touch and change someones life." />
