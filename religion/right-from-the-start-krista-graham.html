  <title>Right from the Start - Krista Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;True or False: A person is a Christian if he or she believes the right things about Jesus.
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;True or False: A person is a Christian if he or she obeys God&#39;s laws.
&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;True or False: A person is a Christian if he or she believes the right things about Jesus and obeys God&#39;s laws.
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Would it surprise you to hear the correct answer to all three questions is&lt;/i&gt; False?
&lt;p&gt;Too many people misunderstand their faith at the most foundational level. Because of this misunderstanding, they pursue Christian growth and maturity in all the wrong ways. The result is failure, frustration, and the inevitable conclusion that Christianity doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Right From the Start&lt;/i&gt; is a two-part study exploring the truth that Christianity is not a creed or a lifestyle; it is a God-begotten life growing in you, which is spiritual in nature and therefore must be nourished on spiritual food and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchored in the teachings of John, part one of this study explores what the Christian&#39;s new life is made of and how to nourish it to maturity. Part two goes to the next level, demonstrating how a new way of living flows out of a new kind of being.  This is not your typical application stage of Bible study. Too often when Bible studies begin to get practical, they cease to be spiritual. Spiritual truth gets relegated to the realm of theory and the real day-to-day Christianity is lived out in the strength of the flesh  which essentially means it is not lived out at all.  This study does not leave the Holy Spirit behind when it comes time to apply the principles learned. Rooted in the book of Titus, the second part of this study examines the Christian life as a series of portraits of Christ and shows clearly and simply how Christ can be formed in you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
