  <title>Choosing Joy - Chris Swanson, Natalie Swanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Choosing Joy is the true story of a young Minnesota family overcoming the tragic loss of their four-year-old boy. Cameron was beautiful, full of life, strong-willed, creative, thoughtful, and aware of heavenly things that surprised his parents. He was mischievous in the best sense of the word but also understood when people were sad or needed encouragement. He would whisper in their ears, &quot;I think they need Jesus in their heart.&quot; Sadly, his life was cut short in an accident in his own backyard.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the night of his death, his parents had to make a choice with broken hearts between anger and joy.  They had seen other families lose loved ones and how brokenness, addiction, abuse, divorce, and suicide had followed. With other children to care for, they dismissed the bitterness and feelings of abandonment that had already started to creep in, and they chose joy.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds, hear the conversations, see through both parents eyes, and learn how God revealed His graciousness. Read how they walked through the ups and downs in the months and years that followed, keeping their hope-filled hearts open to be touched by God.&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Choosing Joy will help you rekindle hope, forgive, call on God again, and trust His will.&lt;/p&gt;" />
