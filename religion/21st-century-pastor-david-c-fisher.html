  <title>21st Century Pastor - David C. Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The third millennium. It&#39;s a time of tremendous opportunity for the church--and tremendous challenge. More than ever, pastors need a model for ministry that can equip them for the rigors of a restless, increasingly secularized culture. In the 21st Century Pastor, David Fisher explores the apostle Paul&#39;s concept of ministry to offer a paradigm that is both biblical and relevant. Paul&#39;s view is fleshed out with examples from Fisher&#39;s own twenty-five years of pastoral experience, presenting a roadmap for today&#39;s pastor that is scholarly, practical, dynamic, and inspiring. The 21st Century Pastor first addressees crucial issues of pastoral identity, the significance of geography, time, and ecclesiology. It then explores Paul&#39;s metaphors for ministry (jars of clay, farmers and builders, servants and stewards, and others) to reveal an accurate portrait of an effective, biblical pastor--the kind who will speak to the heart of modern culture rather than languish on its fringes. Filling the rare role of a pastor to pastors, Fisher&#39;s sage insights help pastors answer their own identity questions, empowering them to minister to a deeply needy society. Says Fisher, &quot;Pastors who know what time it is will, in the name and power of God, create communities of faith where the values of the Gospel are embraced, taught, and lived out.&quot;" />
