  <title>You Are Psychic - Trish Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is designed to help you to become psychic readers, with a deeper understanding of spirit world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are powerful beings, our psychic abilities come in many forms and start with hunches, gut feelings, visions, premonitions and thoughts. We have access to other realms and we can uncover the hidden mysteries of life. We are challenged to develop our instinct for prophecy and to work on building our clairvoyance, clairsentience and knowing. We can develop these skills through meditation, psychometry, and the many training exercises set out in this book to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is psychometry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to read the vibrations placed in an object by your friend, family member or client&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Would you like to be able to read a beautiful flower chosen by the enquirer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pick up a set of keys or a piece of jewellery and tune into messages from spirit world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Hold a unique shell or many other objects and let your mind flow into information about possible romance, career prospects, holidays, new love or spiritual advancement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Through meditation and spiritual exercises you will connect with your inner guide or higher-self&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are encouraged to open your awareness, and accept the unexpected answers to your questions which at first will come randomly into your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your abilities will become more of your everyday life as you accept that you really are psychic and developing your intuition becomes both a pleasure and an exciting adventure as you enter into the unknown realms of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its your gift, learn how to enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
