  <title>Happy the People: When Love Becomes Justice - Marie D. Hoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The social-justice teachings of the Church are a genuine source of pride for all contemporary Catholics, yet many people are unsure what those teachings are. In Happy the People, Marie D. Hoff helps us understand the basic themes of Catholic social justice teachings through individual and group study format. Using teaching documents and Scripture, we are not only taught about social teaching, but how it is important to recognize in our own lives where and how this teaching comes to play.   Topics include the foundations and values of Catholic social-justice teaching, human dignity and human rights, participation in the community for the common good, work and economic life, globalization, care for creation, peacemaking, and putting social justice into action.   Appendices cover further resources for information and action, heroes of social justice, and suggestions for action." />
