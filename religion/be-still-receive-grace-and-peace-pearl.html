  <title>Be Still, Receive Grace and Peace - Pearl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do people from 2,000 years ago relate to today? You will be amazed at how close you come to many if not all of the people and events that will be explored in this devotional. They may even be part of your life today &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearl committed her life to Jesus Christ when she was entering middle age and involved in Bible study with women who taught her the Bible.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Her life seemed to be in shambles; her marriage was in shambles, and she felt in her heart there was something missing. She attended a womans conference and gave her life to Christ. The chaos began to fall away; Christ came in and gave her the desire and the heart to face what was wrong, transform a marriage that was ending, face tragic childhood issues, and turn them into testimonies for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
