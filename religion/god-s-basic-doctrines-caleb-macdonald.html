  <title>God’S Basic Doctrines - Caleb MacDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Church is Full of False Teachings
Part of a prophets work is to expose all the lies and heresies that 
others are preaching.  A prophet involves being bold to attack
false doctrines that a Church has incorporated into any culture.  
Caleb is now being sent from God to be a prophet to America.  
Gods World is the next step for anyone to gain a close walk with God.
For 2000 years we have been lied to from the Church.
Gods World - Basic Doctrines exposes many of the false doctrines
concerning God and how to get to Heaven once we die.
From the book Americas Resurrection, author Caleb dives 
into one of the main reasons why God is sending judgments.
The Church is at fault and is the reason why the World is in such a wicked state.  Author Caleb goes into 
some detail explaining what went wrong with the Church doctrinally - exposing their false doctrines.
Ever wonder why nothing ever works for you in God?
Ever wonder why God never speaks to you as in the Bible?
Gods World - Basic Doctrines spells out the truth as is presented in the Bible.  Author Caleb uses large 
amounts of Bible verses to back up all that he explains.  In the end you are left to make your own
logical conclusions based upon what is written in the Bible not what the Church would have you believe.
Caleb makes the Bible easy to understand  - you will not be disappointed!
Author Caleb is a remarkable man because of His walk with God throughout his life. 
His close relationship with God becomes evident shortly after you meet with him.
He has gone on to the depths of God where others have given up.  Here is a 
true servant of God.  Caleb is now being sent from God to be a prophet to America
and the rest of the World.  Gods World will help anyone gain a walk with God.
Caleb is also an award winning fine arts photographer.  He worked as a letter 
carrier for the U.S.P.S. for 35 years.  God is also calling Caleb to pastor a church in
Colorado where he resides.  Caleb enjoys working out, hiking, traveling, and teaching 
others about the kingdom of God." />
