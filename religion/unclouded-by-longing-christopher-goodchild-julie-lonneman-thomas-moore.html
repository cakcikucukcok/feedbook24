  <title>Unclouded by Longing - Christopher Goodchild, Julie Lonneman, Thomas Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Truth waits for eyes unclouded by longing.&#39;
Lao-Tzu (poet and philosopher)
In this collection of short, contemplative, enlightening reflections, qualified spiritual director and Quaker elder Chris Goodchild, inspired by his own experiences, guides you through his spiritual and philosophical journey to his truest and most peaceful self. Written from a &#39;soul&#39; perspective, the book reveals how, by looking beyond vulnerability to see innate strength, and searching beyond pain and turmoil to find peace and serenity, anyone can affirm their true humanity despite the hardships and distractions of modern life.
Goodchild&#39;s compassionate route through difficulties, doubt, grief and fear is marked with dynamic tenderness and an artful embrace of abundant sources of wisdom. Spirituality, psychology and philosophy are seamlessly woven together in an inclusive Quaker context, led by the common values of love and forgiveness.
In a world increasingly weighed down with the baggage of the self, this book will speak to anyone searching for a more clear-sighted, meaningful presence in the eternal universe." />
