  <title>100 Answers to Questions from the Neighborhoods - Tim Wallingford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;100 Answers to Questions from the Neighborhoods: Personal Evangelism Done Jesus Style Companion Study Guide is a modern-day application of Jesus and the apostles strategy to fulfill the Great Commission. In just 30 years their evangelistic method was bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world (Colossians 1:6)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know Jesus walked over 3,000 miles through neighborhoods throughout Palestine? In Matthew 10, Jesus commanded his disciples to go into a neighborhood, find a worthy person and stay at their home. From there they went out and met the neighbors. The disciples then showed love to those they met by meeting any physical need(s). Only then would they share Gods love story, the gospel of Christ. This was also Jesus personal strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most evangelistic plans involve attracting the neighbors into the church. Churches do this with events, dynamic worship services, and quality programs for every member of the family. Many churches do this well but sadly the American church is in decline. Less than 20% of Americans now regularly attend church. In 1990, 20.4% attended church. In 2000, the percentage dropped to 18.7%. By the year 2050 if the church doesnt change, it is estimated church attendance will drop to 11.7%.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This can be reversed if we adopt the evangelistic strategy used by Jesus and the apostles. This book gives you a detailed breakdown of the gospel the apostle Peter presented on the Day of Pentecost that ended with 3,000 baptisms in one day! The book will also show you how Luke, the author or Acts, packaged the never-changing gospel to ten different types of neighborsthe hurting, religious, spiritualist, seeker, fanatic, good person, abuser, skeptic, misinformed and pleasure seeker. This book and its training manual identify over one hundred questions about spiritual matters and help you have the answers your neighbors need to hear!&lt;/p&gt;" />
