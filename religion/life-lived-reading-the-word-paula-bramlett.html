  <title>Life Lived, Reading the Word - Paula Bramlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God lives! &lt;/strong&gt;He wants you to get to know Him through His word - the Bible, and His Spirit. He will teach&lt;br /&gt;
you and give you peace for each day as you search for Him. &lt;strong&gt;God is not dead!&lt;/strong&gt; One can know and see this&lt;br /&gt;
is true by seeing how many lives have been changed and given a new hope &amp;ndash; eternal life. The author&lt;br /&gt;
sees this as proof that God demonstrates the He is alive in many millions of lives all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will be convinced by reading and pursuing this devotional that God has many individuals under His guidance. His plan for each of them is the beginning of a new life when they give Him their permission. He does not force Himself on anyone. In&amp;nbsp;this book you will find choices to make to be able to see God working and changing your life. I encourage you to take the plunge, it is so worth it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will see examples of His unconditional love, His power, and His presence &amp;ndash; Omnipotent, Omniscient, and&lt;br /&gt;
Omnipresent. There is not enough room to list all of God&amp;rsquo;s attributes, but you will definately find more compiled in&lt;br /&gt;
this book! Choose you this day whom ye will serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Word of the Lord abideth forever. Each day hear His Voice and do not harden your heart with&lt;br /&gt;
unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the author&amp;rsquo;s desire for us to be sensitive to everyone we meet. Just like when we see people, we can&lt;br /&gt;
picture them as an individuals created in the image of God, who need a Savior. Whatever you do for&lt;br /&gt;
others, you are doing it to/for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John 17:3&lt;br /&gt;
And this is eternal life,&lt;br /&gt;
that they know You, the only true God,&lt;br /&gt;
and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
