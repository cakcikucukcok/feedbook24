  <title>Seek and Ye Shall Find It’S a Testimony - Virginia King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In life, there is much insecurity that comes with the lack of confidence and assurance. We all deal with insecurity at one point or another; its the natural way to gauge whether our ventures will be successful or unsuccessful for us. Often our insecurities may be unwarranted and may cause more stress than they prevent. Life is constantly evolving. What is stable today may change by tomorrow. Often, there will be no room to write about the positive gains of the present. 
There are many disappointments that people may or may not experience. As a result, we have trouble finding purpose and identity; one can find themselves engaging in multiple relationships and experiencing sexual and mental abuse, low self-esteem, loss of faith, and courage. Its not only about having faith in yourself but having faith in others to experience prosperity in life. We will witness the testimony of the many experiences of the past. Through these many discoveries, we will be able to experience what can be turned into wisdom for the future. Once wisdom is sought and found, we can find what is hidden within ourselves." />
