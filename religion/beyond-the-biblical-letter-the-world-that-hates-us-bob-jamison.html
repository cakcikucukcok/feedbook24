  <title>Beyond the Biblical Letter The World that Hates Us - Bob Jamison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions, unbridled by morality and religion. Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
John Adams, 2nd president of the United States&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas Jefferson, 3rd president of the United States&lt;br /&gt;
Today the United Stated leads the world in prison population, rate of divorce, teen pregnancies, voluntary abortions, sexually transmitted diseases, single parent households, teen suicides, cocaine, alcohol, and drug consumption, and pornography production and consumption. The horrendous plight of our children, from increasing broken homes, is getting worse. Yet, parents around the world want to send their children here to escape the death, rape and slavery that is the future they face in so many third world countries.&lt;br /&gt;
Explore these issues with Bob Jamison as he approaches them with a biblical strategy for making the world we live in, our promised inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;
Bob Jamison, 83, is a retired businessman living in the Texas Hill Country. During his life he has transitioned from being unchurched to mildly interested, but questioning to passionately believing in all of the scripture. Bob has a Bachelor of Theology degree and a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Public Administration. He has five children and fourteen grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;" />
