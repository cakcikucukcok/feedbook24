  <title>Going Full Circle: Worship that Moves Us to Discipleship and Missions - Mark C. Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the grip of serious numerical decline, American Evangelical churches are now experiencing a missional movement. God is calling his people to return to a biblical lifestyle that goes full circle in continual worship, discipleship, and missions. Mark Powers connects the dots between these three main elements of authentic Christian living. He presents a theology of missional worship, a detailed discipleship plan, and a strategy for local music missions. Going Full Circle uses everyday language to present a simple thought process to move worshipers and worship leaders to become worshiping disciples on mission.  Are you a casualty of worship wars? Are you worried about the decline of your church? Are you thrilled with fast growth churches but sense there must be something more than spectator worship? Are you confused by the word missional that seems to be popping up everywhere? This book is for you and your friends. Read it, share it, and join the movement!" />
