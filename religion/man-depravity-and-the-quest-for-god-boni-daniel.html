  <title>Man Depravity and the Quest for God - Boni Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He will listen to the prayers of the destitute, for He is never too busy to heed our request. Let&amp;rsquo;s pray for revival that will bring change to our societies. His turning of events, His power to heal our land or judges situations will be greatly marvelled by His creation. His turning of events from hopelessness to life, from death to life is a great thing to be acknowledged. God&amp;rsquo;s way or perspective is different from man&amp;rsquo;s method. God&amp;rsquo;s healing is whole and complete. His turning of impending disaster is miraculous. Psalm 102:19-20 says, &amp;ldquo;For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to release those that are appointed to death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quest for God will bring solution to the problem of mankind. God looks down from the temple in heaven and when we seek for Him, He will hear the groans of His people in Satan&amp;rsquo;s slavery. He will release us from death so that multitudes would stream to the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
