  <title>Prayer for the Bully Victims and the Bully Too - None Grace Dola Balogun None, None Lisa Hainline None</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The numbers are staggering. American schools harbor approximately 2.1 million bullies and 2.7 million of their victims. 1 in 7 Students in grades K-12 is either a bully or a victim of bullying. 56% of students have personally witnessed some type of bullying at school. While 15% of all school absenteeism is directly related to fears of being bullied at school.     While 71% of students report incidents of bullying as a problem at their school, a report says that 1 out of 20 students are physically attacked in secondary schools each month. Those in the lower grades reported being in twice as many fights as those in the higher grades. However, there is a lower rate of serious violent crimes in the elementary level than in the middle or high schools. 90% of 4th graders report being victims of bullying. Among students, homicide perpetrators were more than twice as likely as homicide victims to have been bullied by peers. With the risen facts and statistics, the only help our children need to solve this problem is prayer.    Prayer is the first strategy in changing any situation. The author gives educators, parents, bully victims and offers compassionate, spirit led prayers to bullies, giving all the tools they need to begin to heal their situation through the transforming power of prayer. Within this book, the author openly shares and exposes the reality of bullying within the lives of our children and schools, giving solutions and offering sound biblical wisdom when dealing with the subject and issues of bullying." />
