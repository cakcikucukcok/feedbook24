  <title>Conversations with My Fathers - Isabel Burlouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The two months before Georges unexpected death served as a training ground for his salvation. George made comments almost foretelling his death, asked difficult questions about our heavenly Fathers existence, and claimed to have seen angels when close to death. These life events were undoubtedly orchestrated by our heavenly Father. George was not initiating dialogues with the Father, and his loved ones feared he would depart earth without forming a personal relationship with Him.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a real-life, God-inspired, story of how our heavenly Father uses faithful followers to disciple to others. He uses love, hope, and faith to inspire, awaken, and adopt His distant, rebellious, and orphaned children. Through heartfelt, detailed conversations with her earthly and heavenly fathers, Burlouse shares how He reveals His unfailing love for us. Although we have fathers on this earth, He is the only perfect father.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Conversations with My Fathers brings the hope of reconciliation and salvation to readers. It will forever change the way you view relationships with loved ones who are distant and/or do not have a relationship with the Father. It will move you to look and think about your current relationships with your parents, siblings, friends, and even strangers. Conversation questions at the end of each chapter will inspire you to initiate and experience your own conversations with your amazing heavenly Father.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While we may not all have a good earthly father, we all have a great heavenly Father.  Life is a journey of discovering our true Fathers heart so we can live in the freedom of being a beloved son or daughter.  This is a story of hope, healing, and reconciliation that will reveal the goodness of God in the midst of lifes pain.  Isabel has taken her next step to share her story and will inspire you to do the same.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;John Stickl, Lead Pastor, Valley Creek Church&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Conversations With My Fathers is inspiring, motivating, and reassuring. Reading this book reminds me not to take life and those I love for granted.  The beauty of the relationship between Isabel and her earthly and heavenly Father is breath taking. This book will move readers to understand the absolute truth that our heavenly Father is the only perfect father.  This is a must read for all who yearn to understand the heavenly Fathers unfailing love for His children.  I will heartily share this tender book with anyone who desires a closer walk with their earthly father and/or their heavenly Father.&lt;p&gt;
