  <title>Building Faith in a Christian’S Life to Please God - Elder William Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, Elder William D. Holmes talks about the importance of having faith in God. It is necessary to live a life to please God in true holiness and righteousness. He uses real-life testimonies and experiences of sanctified, Holy Ghost-filled believers he grew up with in the HolinessPentecostal Church. It is through these powerful, real-life testimonies and his own life experiences that cause him to speak with boldness that Jesus truly is a healer, miracle worker, and savior. 
He also uses Bible accounts of the miracle-working power of God through our lord and savior, Jesus Christ. He explains about the different tactics of Satan and how he will try to hinder a person from getting their deliverance from God, how we can defeat Satan and get our blessing, why it takes so long for God to answer prayers, the difference between healing being made whole, and what divine healing is and how God can work with medical profession to bring about healing. He talks about the different levels of the Spirit a believer can climb in God. 
This book gives a clear statement that, without holiness, no person shall see the Lord. Jesus came into the world, not only to forgive us of our sins, but to take sin out of us. Jesus also comes to deliver us from all sickness and disease. Through the stripes of Jesus, we can be healed. Take the limit off of God! This is a very powerful book to increase the faith of a believer to trust God through his only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to meet your every need." />
