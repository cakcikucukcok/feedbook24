  <title>I Shall Live and Not Die and Declare the Works of the Lord and Praying with Purpose - Brenda Stanford Southerland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The book &lt;I&gt;I Shall Live and Not Die and Declare The Works of The Lord&lt;/I&gt; is written to glorify God, the Father of Mercies, the God of all comfort; the Son, Jesus Christ our High Priest; and the Holy Spirit who is our Comforter.  This book is a testimony of how the Lord Jesus, my High Priest, delivered me from death when the enemy (Satan) attacked my body with sickness and disease.  I was impressed by the Holy Spirit to use the Book of Psalms to express God&#39;s goodness and mercy toward me in my deliverance from the bonds of death.  Since God is no respecter of persons, His goodness and mercy will do the same for you.  Throughout the testimony, I will use the Psalms as regular dialogue as I give an account of my healing. It is my belief as you read this testimony which glorifies the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, if you have any sickness or disease in your body, you will be healed; because you will be reading the anointed Word of the Living God, which is Truth, . . . &quot;And you shall know the Truth and it will set you free.&quot;  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Praying with Purpose: Guidelines, &lt;/I&gt;divine instructions, inspired by the Holy Spirit for the development of systematic method for daily prayer that will inspire one to commune and fellowship more with the Father through prayers that are simple, scriptural, and Christ centered.&lt;/P&gt;" />
