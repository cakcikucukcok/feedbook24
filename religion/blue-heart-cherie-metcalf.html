  <title>Blue Heart - Cherie Metcalf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A blue heart is one that bleeds from withina broken, bruised, bleeding heart. Grief is painful, excruciatingly painful. This book divulges a personal account of a loving couple joined together in true marriage, separated by physical death, the pain of that separation, and the miracle of Gods unfailing compassion to a blue heart. Despite the knowledge of Gods Word, Cherie agonized over unanswered questions after the passing of her husband. As the Lord promised, He did not leave her. Through her struggle with grief, God, in His tender, loving kindness, revealed Himself to her to sustain and encourage her faith. This book reveals Gods assurance during grief.
Uplifting and faith-filled. Cherie Metcalf stylistically narrates a marriage of hope, struggles, yet an undying connection to spouse, family, and God.
Dr. M.A. Gallo Sunyoger, author of 
Life Lessons: A Connection of Souls throughout Lifes Journey
The faith, hope, and love that Mrs. Metcalf has always embodied in the classroom and in her life emanate throughout her writing. This book is genuine and inspiring, as is the woman who authored it.
Megan Keenan, former student 
Cherie Metcalf distills the bitter poison of grief and, without taking away its bitterness, turns the poison to medicine. Her rooted faith is manifest in every word she writes.
