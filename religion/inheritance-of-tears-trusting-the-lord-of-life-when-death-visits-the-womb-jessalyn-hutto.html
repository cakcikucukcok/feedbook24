  <title>Inheritance of Tears: Trusting the Lord of Life When Death Visits the Womb - Jessalyn Hutto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miscarriage: deeply traumatic, tragically common, too often misunderstood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a woman becomes pregnant, miscarriage is usually the furthest thing from her mind. Such was the case for Jessalyn Hutto when she became pregnant with her first baby. But as is all too common in our post-fall world, the life she carried came to an abrupt end. Death had visited her womb, and the horrors of miscarriage had become a part of her life&amp;rsquo;s story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, she would lose two children in the womb, at 6 and 15 weeks gestation. Through these painful losses, a whole new world of suffering opened up to her. It seemed that everywhere she looked women were quietly mourning the loss of their unborn children. Yet this particular type of loss has been grossly overlooked by the church.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Couples navigating the unique sorrow of losing a child are often left with little biblical counsel to draw upon. Well-meaning friends and family often offer empty platitudes and Christian clich&amp;eacute;s. But what these couples truly need is the hope of the gospel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Short, sensitive, and theologically robust,&lt;em&gt;Inheritance of Tears&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers hope and comfort to those who are called to walk through the painful trial of miscarriage, and shows pastors and church members how to effectively minister to these parents in their time of need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
