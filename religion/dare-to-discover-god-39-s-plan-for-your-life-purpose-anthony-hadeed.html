With so much of our lives spent pursuing some form of work, it is astounding that so few of us give adequate considered thought to our job choices. We usually fall into jobs chosen for us by our families or we pursue choices purely for the sake of earning a certain amount of money. &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; estimates that an alarming 80% of us are dissatisfied with our jobs. Our approach to our job choices is therefore obviously not working. &lt;em&gt;Dare to Discover God&amp;rsquo;s Plan for Your Life Purpose &lt;/em&gt;reveals how scientific Psychometric Assessments&amp;nbsp;can help us understand our core traits and values. It is only when these traits and values are satisfied, that we can live fulfilled lives.
