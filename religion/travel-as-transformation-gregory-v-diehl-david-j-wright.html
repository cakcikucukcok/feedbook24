  <title>Travel As Transformation - Gregory V. Diehl, David J. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: not your standard travel book - a solo traveler&amp;#39;s philosophical memoirs on the personal development effects of cultural expansion.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A daring, intelligent, and unapologetic call to find yourself through travel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you travel to a foreign place, do you experience this new life as your old self? Or do you&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;a new version of you? From living in a van on the streets of San Diego, to growing chocolate with indigenous tribes in Central America, to teaching in the Middle East and volunteering in Africa, bestselling author Gregory V. Diehl has followed a worldly and unconventional path through life. Leaving his California home as a teenager, he fully immersed himself, living and working, in 45 countries across the globe&amp;mdash;all by age 28. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Travel As Transformation&lt;/em&gt;, he puts his diverse cultural experiences on display and asks the reader to question how their own identity has been shaped by the lifestyle they live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you delve into&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Travel As Transformation&lt;/em&gt;, you will learn just how profoundly solo travel can influence your perception of yourself. Diehl teaches aspiring solo travelers, vagabonds, and nomads to let go of their internal inhibitions and former sense of self. To encourage world wanderers to embrace change, he shares his own stirring experiences of transformation across Costa Rica, China, Morocco, Armenia, Iraq, Monaco, Ecuador, and more. By embarking on this nomadic journey alongside him, you will learn to examine all of humanity through unbiased eyes and discover all that lies just beyond your backyard. A new, vast cultural experience awaits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To travel alone with a truly open mind is to forget who you were when you started. It is to be constantly born anew, and identify with ways of existence you did not know were possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Travel As Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will give you the wisdom, the inspiration, and the resources to conquer the limitations placed on you by your home culture. It&amp;rsquo;s time to take advantage of everything the world has to offer and become everything you can be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
