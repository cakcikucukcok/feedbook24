  <title>Wilderness Reflections - Jeff Vordermark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is the ultimate teacher, and if you choose to allow Him, He will touch your life in eternal ways. It can even happen while you sit shivering in a tree stand, waiting for a deer that never shows. 
Author Jeff Vordermark has come to treasure those moments in the wilderness and how they have helped him journey closer to God as a result. Wilderness Reflections: A Pursuit of Gods Lessons in the Field is a collection of short stories that grew out of Vordermarks search for meaning in the Bible and adventures in the outdoors. Mens souls seem to be in conflict between the demands of their everyday lives and their recreational pursuits. Sunday church time can seem to be more about duty than community. The call of the wild can all too often reach into the pews and distract us from our heavenly goals, but the two need not be separated. 
The stories included in Wilderness Reflections: A Pursuit of Gods Lessons in the Field reflect Vordermarks journey from Sunday-only church to having it any day of the week. It is in this churchthe church of the woodsthat one can find meaning and seek to clarify the muddle of everyday life." />
