  <title>Elders Lead a Healthy Family: Shared Leadership for a Vibrant Church - J. R. Miller, Gary L. McIntosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elders Lead a Healthy Family explores the biblical paradigm for shared leadership: elders as the spiritual &quot;big brothers&quot; and shepherds to the family of God. This book is a fresh biblical alternative to the standard fare of pragmatic church leadership. Delivered in a winsome and irenic style, the book addresses the key concerns of our day, including pastoral burnout, women as elders, women and the pastoral gift, power in leadership, abuse of power in ministry, ministerial pay, and fostering missional-leadership structures. The answer to so many of the problems facing the church is not more coaching or better education. The answer requires our churches to change the very structures that foster abuse, isolation, and burnout. If we hope to save our pastors, then we need our pastors to abandon the &quot;pastor-as-CEO&quot; model of leadership. If we want to reach the lost, we need a systemic change in the way we plant, grow, and maintain our churches. Instead of putting a solo leader at the top of &quot;Church Incorporated,&quot; we need to build teams of elders, doing ministry together, as they lead the family of God." />
