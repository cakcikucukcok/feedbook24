  <title>A Beautiful Mess - Victoria A. Davenport</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever taken a moment before you are ready to make a decision and envision what the outcome might be, not only for you but for your loved ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you struggle with feelings of guilt because you would rather be an instigator rather than a peacemaker? Are you attracted to being more naughty than nice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allure of the natural world and all of its temptations can be very appealing in what it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your future is determined by the result of choices you make now and have made in your past. It is the outcome of either choosing to be guided by the inner voice of your spirit, or decisions made based on desires the natural world lures you to act upon. Listen first to your spirit&#39;s guidance then compare it to your earthly desires. The common karmic thread always is the same-we make a choice based on either coming from a place of spirit or driven by the impulses of our flesh. The consequences result from which one we choose and are wholly responsible in making those choices---what we know as free will.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to truly understand what your real motives and intentions are in all decisions that you make; no matter how big or how small; they will determine your path in life. Allow your spirit to have a voice in guiding you. Remember this is not about failing or succeeding; this is about doing and being. You may try many times to connect with your spirit and think it hasn&#39;t worked or feel no difference-but it only takes that one special moment in time when you will sense it...feel it....It will happen. There is nothing so satisfying as connecting with your God Source; it is unlike anything you have ever experienced before. You will feel a physical shift within the center of your being. &lt;br /&gt;Once you have possessed this feeling the next time it occurs you will notice it much quicker and know instantly you are aligned with your spirit; it is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
