  <title>Young, Restless, No Longer Reformed: Black Holes, Love, and a Journey In and Out of Calvinism - Austin Fischer, Scot McKnight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does it really matter?   Does it matter if we have free will? Does it matter if Calvinism is true? And does what you think about it matter? No and yes.  No, it doesn&#39;t matter because God is who he is and does what he does regardless of what we think of him, just as the solar system keeps spinning around the sun even if we&#39;re convinced it spins around the earth. Our opinions about God will not change God, but they can change us. And so yes, it does matter because the conversations about free will and Calvinism confront us with perhaps the only question that really matters: who is God?  This is a book about that question--a book about the Bible, black holes, love, sovereignty, hell, Romans 9, Jonathan Edwards, John Piper, C. S. Lewis, Karl Barth, and a little girl in a red coat. You&#39;ve heard arguments, but here&#39;s a story--Austin Fischer&#39;s story, and his journey in and out of Calvinism on a trip to the center of the universe." />
