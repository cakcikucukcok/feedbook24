  <title>Secrets of Greatness - Dr. Barrington O. Burrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Secrets of Success, Dr Burrell provides us with a route map to success of the very highest order, consistent with the greatest model of success known to us, Jesus Christ.
Based upon an intimate study of the Old and New Testaments, and a lifetimes work as a pastor, and drawing together such disparate threads as psychology, biology, history and motivational dynamics, Dr Burrell gives his readers a meticulous and definitive explanation of the essence of greatness and how it is within the capability of each and every one of us to achieve more than we ever thought possible.
A thorough and passionate exploration of what it means to be great, using examples of great men and women through the ages, Secrets of Success decries the notion that true success lies in power, money and status, and illustrates instead that the pinnacle of human achievement is attainable only through the transformative and healing power of our relationship with God.
In each chapter and section, the author shines a light on a different aspect of the process of becoming what we are destined to be in the Creators great plan for us, and illuminates the spaces through which we all must travel on our journey to greatness.
Dr Burrell explores his subject with the keen mind of a scholar, the compassion of a man of God and the tenacity of a warrior, and has written a book which is as uplifting as it is useful. It is a book which can only fill us with hope for the future.
Secrets of Greatness is a corrective for our secular age  a spiritual book in materialistic times - and a tonic for all those who thirst for a different measure of success than is commonly presented in our media." />
