  <title>Everyone Leads - Chris Lowney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Catholic Church is suffering its worst decline in five centuries&amp;mdash;a precipitous slide that will turn catastrophic unless reversed by fundamental changes in strategy, culture, and leadership style. Even the inspiring leadership of Pope Francis will not reverse the slide without a strategy for action, from the grassroots through the hierarchy. Bestselling author Chris Lowney, a former Jesuit seminarian and business executive who now chairs one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest Catholic ministries, not only outlines the challenges but also maps the path forward in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Everyone Leads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bracing review of the church&amp;rsquo;s global struggles&amp;mdash;from clergy shortages to declining participation&amp;mdash;Lowney draws on two decades of change-management experience to propose an &amp;quot;EASTeR&amp;quot; strategy of five transformational principles: be entrepreneurial, be accountable, serve, transform, and reach out. These five ideas can catalyze profound change in every parish, in how bishops think, and in the roles laypeople play in leading the church. Filled with real-life examples, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Everyone Leads &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;outlines strategies that anyone can employ&amp;mdash;from the pews to the pulpit&amp;mdash;to strengthen the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a former business executive who lectures globally about leadership, Lowney speaks credibly about the institution&amp;rsquo;s challenges and potential. And, as chair of one of Catholicism&amp;rsquo;s largest hospital systems, he writes &amp;ldquo;from within&amp;rdquo; as a Catholic who loves his church and is committed to seeing it flourish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
