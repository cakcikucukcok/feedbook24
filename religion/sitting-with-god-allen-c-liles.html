  <title>Sitting with God - Allen C. Liles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;HOW MEDITATION CAN HELP YOU ESTABLISH A DIRECT CONNECTION TO GOD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF GLORY&lt;/br&gt;
Colossians 1: 27 (NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible states in the Scriptures that God has placed the Christ Spirit within each one of us. In John 14:20, Jesus says On that day you will realize that I am in the Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Author Allen C. Liles, an ordained non-denominational minister, wants us to consider using the daily practice of meditation to help establish a direct link between us and the Divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Liles shares the wisdom, guidance, insight and support that he received from God and the Christ Spirit within us over a full year of sitting in the silence every morning. He claims no special relationship with God. Rev. Liles believes that each of us can access the Holy Presence by becoming open and receptive to sitting with God in meditation on a regular basis. His struggles during the year included the illness of his wife, retirement from a ministerial career, aging, caregiving, family issues with adult children, financial concerns, and finding the courage to take life one day at a time. No matter what your problems or concerns, Rev. Liless experiences in meditation offer hope for a happier, fulfilled and more peaceful life in a time of turmoil and change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
