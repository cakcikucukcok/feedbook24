  <title>Woman of Virtue - Susan Brackley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is a virtuous woman? Times have changed. Have Gods answers expired over time? Is Gods design for women the same as it was years ago? Has God changed His definition of virtue? How does the detailed description of godly virtue in Proverbs 31 apply to the twenty-first century? Woman of Virtue is a detailed exposition of Proverbs 31; it is designed to unfold the scriptures that clearly answer these questions as well as help us apply them to our everyday lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where the destructive influences of the feminist movement are creeping into the church, Christian women need to be aware of what God teaches concerning His good design for them. Contrary to popular belief and, sadly, even some opinions within Christendom, feminism has not helped or improved Gods original design for women. In fact, feminism and Gods truth are diametrically opposedthey are polar opposites! Feminism is Satans cheap counterfeit of Gods good intention for women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is not silent throughout scripture concerning His plan for women, marriage, and the family. He holds each of us accountable to learn, trust, and apply what He has ordained. Gods design for women still applies to us today just as much as it did when He created us uniquely for our role in the world. God wants believers to know what a virtuous, God-fearing, honest, modest, righteous, and hard-working woman isright now in the twenty-first century!&lt;/p&gt;" />
