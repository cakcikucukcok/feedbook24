  <title>The New Testament: God&#39;s Message of Goodness, Ease and Well-Being Which Brings God&#39;s Gifts of His Spirit, His Life, His Grace, His Power, His Fairness - Jonathan Paul Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This work: features expanded and amplified meanings of many of the words in the Greek New Testament; provides multiple renderings of some phrases and sentences, where these are viable; includes readings from different eclectic Greek texts, as well as from early individual manuscripts that present a significant change in the meaning of the text; supplies optional functioning of noun and adjective cases, where the context supports these options; expands the renderings of the Greek verbs to show the meanings of their individual tense characteristics. On one occasion of multiplying &amp;quot;the loaves and the fishes,&amp;quot; after the meal Jesus told His disciples to &amp;quot;gather up the fragments, so that nothing will be lost.&amp;quot; This version presents to you many &amp;quot;fragments&amp;quot; of meaning of the Greek text that have often been lost to the reader of the common translations, or of &amp;quot;thought translations,&amp;quot; or of translations that present &amp;quot;dynamic equivalents.&amp;quot; This is a work that seeks to give the reader some involvement in the process of translating by presenting a range of semantic meanings of significant Greek words in the midst of the text. Expansions and amplifications are placed in parentheses. Other optional renderings of either phrases or sentences are made parenthetical and come after the word &amp;quot;or,&amp;quot; followed by a colon. Readings from other manuscripts (MSS) that differ from the eclectic texts (texts that are a compilation of what are considered by textual scholars to be the best readings from the many available manuscripts) are normally enclosed in brackets, but are sometimes conflated (i.e., joined together) into my version. Also enclosed in brackets are words that I have added to make the English rendering sensible (see above example), as well as occasional notes, comments and suggested possible meanings of the text. Koine Greek is an inflected language. The functions of nouns, adjectives, etc., are indicated by their spelling - which also determines the case for each. However, the cases - especially the genitive and the dative - have a variety of functions. The translator must determine which function the author intended. This is normally determined by the sense of the context in which the word is used. Sometimes the function is clear, but many times it is not. To allow the reader to have some freedom from the translator&amp;#39;s bias or personal choice, I have parenthetically included the other options.&lt;/p&gt;" />

    	<p>This work: features expanded and amplified meanings of many of the words in the Greek New Testament; provides multiple renderings of some phrases and sentences, where these are viable; includes readings from different eclectic Greek texts, as well as from early individual manuscripts that present a significant change in the meaning of the text; supplies optional functioning of noun and adjective cases, where the context supports these options; expands the renderings of the Greek verbs to show the meanings of their individual tense characteristics. On one occasion of multiplying "the loaves and the fishes," after the meal Jesus told His disciples to "gather up the fragments, so that nothing will be lost." This version presents to you many "fragments" of meaning of the Greek text that have often been lost to the reader of the common translations, or of "thought translations," or of translations that present "dynamic equivalents." This is a work that seeks to give the reader some involvement in the process of translating by presenting a range of semantic meanings of significant Greek words in the midst of the text. Expansions and amplifications are placed in parentheses. Other optional renderings of either phrases or sentences are made parenthetical and come after the word "or," followed by a colon. Readings from other manuscripts (MSS) that differ from the eclectic texts (texts that are a compilation of what are considered by textual scholars to be the best readings from the many available manuscripts) are normally enclosed in brackets, but are sometimes conflated (i.e., joined together) into my version.
