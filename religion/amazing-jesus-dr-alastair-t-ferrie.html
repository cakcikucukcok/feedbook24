  <title>Amazing Jesus - Dr Alastair T. Ferrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is all about a Person, a rather amazing Person.&lt;i&gt;Amazing Jesus&lt;/i&gt; will remind us why Christianity has survived more than 2,000 years and Jesus has more followers today than He has ever had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most startling news of all was that God took on human form. God became a man and lived among men that we might see the glory of our Creator. God incarnate! Amazing! Not surprisingly, wherever Jesus went, the miraculous was sure to follow. He became known as the Miracle Man. Healings, water becoming wine, feeding the 5,000, walking on stormy seas. No wonder the crowds followed Him and many believed in Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called us to a totally different way of living. A way that has been recognized through the centuries as the finest way to live. It is characterized by loving kindness, consideration, emancipation. Look at the Jesus way and marvel at His wisdom. His death and resurrection continue to speak to people in the 21st century. Countless thousands embrace Him as Saviour and King. The empty tomb calls upon us to consider the Jesus story, and follow the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
