  <title>One Mistake- Many Problems - Dr. Emmanuel Oduro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I titled this book One Mistake-Many Problems for several reasons. First of all, I want to explain what is meant by mistake. The concise Oxford Dictionary defines mistake as an incorrect idea or opinion; a thing incorrectly done or thought. We all make mistakes. Some of our mistakes are accidental, while others are intentional and sinful. There are many mistakes found in the scriptures. In Genesis 3, both Adam and Eve responded to mistakes by shifting the blame to each other after eating the forbidden fruit. Samson also made a foolish mistake when he revealed the secret of his strength to Delilah. This led to his capture and his eyes being gouged out. In the same way, our parents made several mistakes by going to satanic agents for solutions to problems they were going through. Some of the mistakes our parents created were by selfish pursuit of their own agenda. They made evil contracts with satanic agents in exchange for something without knowing the consequences. We are now reaping the consequences.  As we read through this book, we may be able to understand and know some of the mistakes our parents or we ourselves did that have affected us. The writer explains what we could do to come out of any mistake we might have done knowingly or unknowing that have brought untold hardships in our lives." />
