  <title>Christ Inviting Sinners to Come to Him for Rest - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Jeremiah Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jeremiah Burroughs (1599-1646), was a brilliant Reformed preacher of the Gospel, and an astute theologian.   Every now and again, an old work will be published that is of such great spiritual worth, that it is hard to put into words the incalculable and infinite good that it is to the Christian soul. This book is one of those works.  Burroughs expounds Matthew 11:28, &quot;Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&quot; Christ invites sinners to come to Him for rest. Sinners, in this way, can be either Christians or unbelievers. He shows the burden of sin, the burden of the Law, the burden of legal performances with the misery of those that are under them, the burden of corruption, and the burden of outward affliction.  This is a life-transforming work which will enable Christians to inwardly examine themselves as they consider how the Law of God correlates to their abiding in the Lord Jesus, and what steps they must take to come to Christ in a saving and sanctifying manner." />
