  <title>The Revelation of Lucifer - Thomas Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I saw Jesus on the cross, and all of heaven was motionless. I could see legions of angels just waiting near the cross. Then, as I looked upon the cross, I couldnt bear to look at what I was seeing, for it was extremely sad. The last time I saw Jesus, it was a picture of absolute splendor, majesty, and glory when He came forth from His Father. But now to look at Him was almost impossible, for He looked nothing like He did earlier  Just then, my attention was taken back down into hell. Every demon was in a state of frenzy and hysteria. They were acting and behaving like wild beasts, animals. You could see some type of disgusting foam coming from their mouths. It was repulsive. They were all yelling Its over! Its over! You could see they were anticipating Jesus arrival. Satan had this disturbed, distorted, indescribable look on his face as he had conquered all the universe. He looked like he knew he was finally able to affect God and that he wouldnt be able to recover.&lt;/p&gt;" />
