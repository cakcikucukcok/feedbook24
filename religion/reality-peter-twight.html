  <title>Reality - Peter Twight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="America is in a multi-cultural crisis. We are straying from our God given roots. We have seen the consequences building for eight years. In horror, the rural roots and working-class America recoiled, and as a consequence, God gave us a working-class billionaire, and here we are. What shall we do? We need to return to the strong times of Americas beginning. Our evolutionary roots are fundamentally religious. We want a religion of the heart, a religion where the Spirit of God walks with us, and he talks with us, and he tells us were not alone because he lives in and with us. What might that be like to walk with the Spirit, with nature, and natures God? Today this is the new/old theology of science and the reality that we all have believed in, the hidden God/reality in whom we live and move and have our being. You can follow science all the way into the reality that we know only partially from our traditions and need to know again in our hearts.
This book does what no other book does; it begins with the science of evolution of the universe, life, humans and brains, including some information about our quantum brain that supports quantum connections to the universe and the dimension of spirit. It then gives a brief up-to-date summary of modern biblical knowledge providing an originalist theological interpretation.  It sets the stage for science with a brief history of how Christianity developed, how it then was undermined by its child, the now dominating science that has newly reached studies of consciousness  - the edge of theology.  This study is a brief unorthodox rethinking of the importance of religion in modern society, comparing theological translations of biblical history with a laymans summary of the, theological significance of modern scientific knowledge in biology, quantum physics and cosmology, and pleads for a reconstruction of Christian doctrines and a re-birth of spirituality in everyday life as a cure for our modern chaos." />
