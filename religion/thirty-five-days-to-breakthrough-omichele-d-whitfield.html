      <meta name="description" content="There comes a point in life when you come to a crossroad between Gods will for you, as you know it, and current circumstances youre faced with. Making the right choices in the right timing can often be intimidating and unclear. Many times in each of our lives, we have secret strugglesthings we cannot share with others or even things we really dont know that exist deep within our spirits. Ultimately, we end up in a struggle between our Spirit and our flesh where our relationship with God and our assignment for the kingdom often hangs in the balance. Its time to break those strongholds and shift gears toward Gods plans for you. 
You are more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus! Christ won the victory at the cross, and he ever intercedes for your victorious triumph through lifes processes to lay hold on the promise.
