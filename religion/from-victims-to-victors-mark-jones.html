  <title>From Victims to Victors - Mark Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young Angela wondered if she would live to see tomorrow as her abuser held her head under the water at the pond in the field behind her home. She used to feel safe herefishing, chasing frogs, or just walking with her dog. 
Victoria was very afraid of her stepfather. Every time he told her to get in the car with him, she knew she would have to endure another incident of sexual abuse. She tried numerous times to tell her mother, but her mother was afraid to deal with the situation, choosing to live in denial and allowing Victoria to live in pain and anger. 
In &lt;i&gt;From Victims to Victors,&lt;/i&gt; author Mark Jones shares these and other stories of abuse from victims to whom he has ministered. He tells these stories of sexual, emotional, verbal, physical, and spousal abuse to call attention to this rampant problem in todays society.
Jones points the way to healing and restoration through biblical principles. He makes it clear that a move of Gods hand can deliver victims from the power of Satan and restore them to powerful, victorious living.
