  <title>Major Bible Doctrines - John E. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Where did God come from? What happens the instant we die? How will judgments during the Tribulation progress? What is EMP, and how will it affect the Battle of Armageddon? Who will control the Antichrist directly? In the Bible, who are the only two people who never experienced physical death? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and many other questions will be probed and answered in this book, where appropriate, helpful diagrams will be used to clarify concepts and explanations. Some math, at an understandable level, will also be used to prove certain biblical concepts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The topics studied in this book will be investigated in a simple, straightforward manner. This book is deliberately not written on the seminary level so that many more people may understand it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this book is to help you discover concepts in the Bible that you didnt even know were there and to also help you to better understand them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe this book will also be very inspirational for you and that you will want to go out and share the new things you have learned with other friends and family. And what you do to help someone else to understand will become better solidified in your own mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you endeavor to know Gods Word better, He will help you to understand things you have not understood in the past. Remember, He is still the God of all wisdom and knowledge. Many blessings to you as you pursue Him; He has nuggets of gold waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
