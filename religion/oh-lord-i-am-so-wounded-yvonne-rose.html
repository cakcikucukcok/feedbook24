  <title>Oh Lord, I Am so Wounded! - Yvonne Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oh Lord, I Am So Wounded! is an inspirational book that ministers to those who have emotional scars. Have you ever been wounded, whether physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually? Then this book will inspire you. It is written with the aim of reaching all age groups and ethnicities and genders. Mrs. Yvonne Rose looks at some of the people in the Bible who also suffered tremendous hurts, from family members, strangers, and other people who should have shown them love, but instead rejected and abused them.
	Hannah was married to a man who loved her, but because she was barren, he had to take another wife who could give him the children he needed. The second wife made life miserable for Hannah, because Peninnah knew that Hannah was the love of Elkanahs life. Peninnah had his children, but Hannah had his heart. Hannah became very depressed due to the vicious attacks from her jealous rival until she decided to call on God to help her, and He answered her prayer.
	Leah and Rachel were sisters who were married to the same man. How did this happen? It was love at first sight for this man Jacob. He had swindled his brother Esau out of the inheritance that rightfully belonged to him, now he was a man on the run, from a brother who threatened to murder him. He ran to his uncles home and fell in love with his beautiful daughter Rachel. His uncle Laban agreed to give Rachel in marriage to Jacob in exchange for seven years of hard work. However, on the wedding night, Laban switched sisters, and the next morning, Jacob woke up to find the ugly sister Leah in his bed.
Leah would spend the rest of her life having babies and trying to win the heart of a man who could never love her. She did not know that God loved her and because God saw that she was not loved, he opened her womb and made her fertile, while Rachel was barren. This only created a Baby-Mama-Drama in Jacobs household. The sisters were in a struggle for babies. Then the servants were given to Jacob, and they also had his babies. There was a battle for Jacobs love between two sisters who were emotionally wounded because of their fathers greed.
	Joseph was a teenager who God had chosen for greatness. He was the love of his father, and the envy of his brothers. His eleven brothers hated him and sold him to strangers who took him shackled in irons to Egypt. The man who bought him was a high official in the land. He put Joseph in charge of his household, but his alluring wife could not keep her eyes off this handsome young slave with the great body. When Joseph refused to sleep with Mrs. Potiphar, she cried rape and caused him to be imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. But God was with this young man, and everywhere he was placed, he was put in a position of authority, until he was promoted to become the prime minister in the land of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh.
	Naomi was a bitter mother-in-law who left own land when her husband took his family to a strange land away from the protection of the God they served. Naomi lost her entire family in this foreign country, her husband, and her two sons. She blamed God for her troubles, but what seemed at first like a bad situation, turned out to be a blessing because God had given her a daughter-in-law who loved her and vowed never to leave her. Her daughter-in-law Ruth married a rich man who was able to provide for both of them.
This blessing only took place when they left the place of death to go to the place of life. Naomi and Ruth returned to Bethlehem.
	Then there was the case of the princess who was raped by her eldest brother, but their father, King David, did not do anything about the situation. As a result, Tamars other brother Absalom murdered the brother who had dishonored their sister. Princess Tamar would remain an emotionally wounded woman for the rest of her life, because of the brother who humiliated her, abused her, and then turned and threw her out of his house.
