  <title>The Catholic Church: What Everyone Needs to KnowRG - John L. Allen Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roman Catholicism stands at a crossroads, a classic best of times, worst of times moment. On the one hand, the Catholic Church remains by far the largest branch of the worldwide Christian family, and is growing at a remarkable clip. Yet the Church has also been rocked by a series of scandals related to the sexual abuse of minors by clergy, and, even more devastating, the cover-up by the Church hierarchy. The decade-long crisis has taken a massive financial toll, but the blow to both the internal morale and the external moral standing of the Church has been even steeper. Today, the Church has enormous residual strength and exciting future prospects, but also faces steep internal and external challenges. The question of whither Catholicism is of vital public relevance, for believers and non-believers alike. In The Catholic Church: What Everyone Needs to KnowRG, John L. Allen, Jr., one of the worlds leading authorities on the Vatican, offers an authoritative and accessible guide to the past, present, and future of the Church.
