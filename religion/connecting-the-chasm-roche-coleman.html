  <title>Connecting the Chasm - Roche Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Connecting the Chasm seeks to provide assistance with individual spiritual growth and instruction regarding the essential and foundational biblical truths.  It covers the fall of mankind into sin through the purpose of the local church. All Christians should know what the Bible states regarding salvation, discipleship, sanctification, and their roles in the church. However, there is a dearth of knowledge of the fundamental teachings of Scripture, which has created a chasm between the believer and the Bible. Therefore, attention is given to biblical and theological issues that will compel the reader to go beyond the surface and build a firm foundation on the Word of God. Each facet is designed to facilitate individual spiritual growth for the new Christian as well as the mature Christian. A workbook is included to provide further interaction with the material so it may be utilized as a course text for basic biblical beliefs, a new members orientation course, or a new believers course." />
