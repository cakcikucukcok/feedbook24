  <title>Christology - Gerald O&#39;Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this fully revised and updated second edition of his accessible account of systematic Christology, Gerald O&#39;Collins continues to challenge the contemporary publishing trend for sensationalist books on Jesus that are supported neither by the New Testament witness nor by mainline Christian beliefs.
This book critically examines the best biblical and historical scholarship before tackling head-on some of the key questions of systematic Christology: does orthodox faith present Jesus the man as deficient and depersonalized? Is his sinlessness compatible with the exercise of a free human will? Does up-to-date exegesis challenge his virginal conception and personal resurrection? Can one reconcile Jesus&#39; role as universal Saviour with the truth and values to be found in other religions? What
should the feminist movement highlight in presenting Jesus? This integral Christology is built around the resurrection of the crucified Jesus, highlights love as the key to redemption, and proposes a synthesis of the divine presence through Jesus. Clear, balanced, and accessible, this book should be
valued by any student reading systematic theology, anyone training for the ministry in all denominations, as well as interested general readers." />
