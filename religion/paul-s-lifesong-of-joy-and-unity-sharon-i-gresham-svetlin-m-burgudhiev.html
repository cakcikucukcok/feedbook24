  <title>Paul’S Lifesong of Joy and Unity - Sharon I. Gresham, Svetlin M. Burgudhiev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Paul and Silas were in prison in Philippi, they burst into singing. Paul looked at life with a joyful song. He found delight when believers lived in harmony. The theme of this Bible study is Pauls Life-Song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear his song in the letter he wrote to Philippi, even while in another prison. Some strains explode with joy, while other stanzas carry a minor melody to encourage or warn the people he loved. Study his messages and learn how to apply Pauls attitudes regardless of his circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Bible study is rich with insights into the Hebrew and Greek and covers themes Paul brings from the Old Testament or other New Testament teachings. Dive deeper into those themes by taking important excursions into the background of the topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in-depth verse-by-verse investigation is valuable for individuals or groups. Enjoy the commentary while completing the workbook and applying the messages to everyday situations. Determine your timeframe for the study as you discover what the Lord Jesus wants to do in your life through Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive had the privilege of knowing Sharon Gresham as a teacher/speaker for many years and now as a writer. Her commitment to in-depth study and application of the Bible is refreshing. The Philippians study equips the pastor/teacher with a resource much needed in the church today. I am excited to teach this study both in our church and as we minister internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darrel Auvenshine, pastor of Southside City Church, Fort Worth, Texas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a gift for accurately communicating Gods Word in a relevant and personal way, Sharon Greshams in-depth study of Philippians will delight and thrill any serious student of the Scriptures. I highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;
