  <title>I See You - Nan Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I See You is a nature-inspired book. It is the first book published by Nan Henderson. The photographs are of life, and were taken by Nan as she enjoyed the world around her. The book was not only inspired by the beauty of nature, but by a conversation that Nan had with someone who was questioning whether or not God was real. Asking, If he is, then why doesnt he show himself to me? The answer seemed obvious looking around at the beautiful world he has created. As we look around us, we see his majesty everywhere. There are many stories in the Bible of God revealing himself to people in many different ways. This book compares these stories to the way that we see God reveal himself to us today if we just have our hearts open so our eyes can see him. We may see him in a sunset or the eyes of a child. We need to have an open heart and mind to allow ourselves to be blessed by these everyday miracles." />
