  <title>Begat by God - Dr. Benjamin Dadebo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The concept of being born again appears misunderstood by many. Most
people will tell you they want to go to Heaven. Yet the most important
qualifi cation for entry into Heaven, being born again (born of water and of
the spirit), is not embraced.
This book Begat by God explains why without allowing the cleansing action of
Christ, the word of God (being born of water), and the empowerment by the
spirit (born of the spirit) to do the works pre-ordained by God, it is impossible
to make it into Heaven. Thus being born again simply involves a continuous
transformation because of a conscientious effort by an individual to allow Gods
word (Christ) to dictate his way of life. Entry into Heaven is therefore not about
religion, but about a purposeful transformation through Christ.
The birth of an offspring always involves the development under water in a
confi ned environment, over a specifi ed time frame, followed by an expulsion,
into a completely new environment. This book describes the similarities between
human physical birth and the Spiritual rebirth as in John 3. Thus the invisible
attributes of God including His ideas can be gleaned from studying the natural
processes of His creation (Romans 1:20)." />
