  <title>Fitly Framed Together - Mike Culpepper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How would you change if you knew the Bible were the real, authoritative Word of God?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where did the Bible come from?
	Why do some claim the Bible is the Word of God?
	What difference does it make what we think of the Bible?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible has played a major role in the development of human culture and mankind from the beginning. Fitly Framed Together: The Bible can be a valuable resource that can possibly help your understanding and acceptance as to the validity and authority of the Bible.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may live in a bad news world, but there is actually good news in the Bible. The American people are subject to a tax code that is so enormous that it is ten times thicker than the Bible, and in the past ten years there have been more than five thousand editions and changes. But what has been written in the Bible and applied to the human race stands alone, firm, and unchanging.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christians looking for a good Bible study, Fitly Framed Together: The Bible can strengthen your faith in the Scriptures, drawing you closer to God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-Christians, Fitly Framed Together: The Bible can at least give food for thought that there might be some legitimacy to the Bible, at least worthy of discussion.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a greater and deeper understanding of the Bible can be inspiring, and Fitly Framed Together: The Bible can help you better recognize and appreciate things you read in the Bible, unlocking Gods Word to you. By the nature of its content, history, and presence, the Bible must be fitly framed together.&lt;p&gt;" />
