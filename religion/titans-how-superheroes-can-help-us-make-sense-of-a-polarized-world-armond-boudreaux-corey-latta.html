  <title>Titans: How Superheroes Can Help Us Make Sense of a Polarized World - Armond Boudreaux, Corey Latta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These days it seems like heroes fight each other more often than they fight villains. The hero-vs-hero trope so common in comic books and in superhero movies these days can provide us with a means of thinking about the deeply polarized state of modern politics and public opinion about civic life, morality, and even God. There is a real divide in our public life that nobody seems to be able to cross. It&#39;s easy to complain that people should be more willing to meet each other half-way, that politicians should be more willing to compromise in order to get things done, but there are plenty of important issues on which compromise really isn&#39;t possible. We see this problem dramatized in comics like Marvel&#39;s Civil War and Avengers vs X-Men; in DC&#39;s Kingdom Come and The Dark Knight Returns; and in film media like Daredevil, Batman v Superman, and Captain America: Civil War. The consequences of the conflicts that arise in these stories can serve as warnings about our current political environment. They&#39;re safe places in which we can see the logic of our political dysfunction carried to frightening (but perhaps inevitable?) conclusions." />
