  <title>The Glory Door - B. J. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Glory Door Is the story of two brothers, Fergus and Duncan McNabb from the Highlands of Scotland, who were conscripted by the British Army to fight in the Battle of New Orleans, during the war of 1812. In their very first battle, they were separated and never saw each other again for twenty years. This book is the story of their search to find each other and the humorous, unexpected, romantic and poignant sub plots that pop up along the way. A search that will escort the reader across clans, cultures, countries and continents to their highest mountaintops. As you might expect, any search that is motivated by love is fraught with the unexpected. This search is no exception and moves in and out of  historical events and across the line of real, and the spiritual to the very edge of disaster. Thats when God steps in and sends His angel to escort them through it all. A four legged angel who, by the folks who actually saw her, named Glory. An Angel of many talents. When it is all over and the brothers reunited, one might think back on Leolla and Furball and Wings of Ivy and Hog Breath Hanratty and Pastor Mose and Malaki Messer and wonder. Did it really happen that way? 
Only Glory knows." />
