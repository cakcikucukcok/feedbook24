  <title>Lessons from Ladies of Faith - Barbara Ellen Houston McCain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lessons from Ladies of Faith is a book that demonstrates that the ladies we read about in the Scripture were real women, living actual lives. God gave us a record of their challenges, struggles, and victories as lessons that we can apply to our lives today. From the ladies chronicled in this guide, we can learn lessons about courage, commitment, submission to God, dedication to new challenges, and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we study Eve, Sarah, Mary, Dorcas, and the other women, we will learn that the paths they walked are not so different from the ones we tread today. Through their stories, we can gain insight into the victories of faith that God desires for the modern day Christian woman. Some lessons teach us of His majesty, others of His grace, while others encourage us to explore new levels of spiritual adventure. Whether you are an earnest Christian believer or someone who is curious about the Christian life, there is much to learn about the journey of faith on this path of exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons from Ladies of Faith chronicles thirteen different areas of a life of faith illustrated by the lives of different women in the Bible. By application to our present day lives, hopefully, we will come to understand our own life journey through those of these women.&lt;/p&gt;" />
