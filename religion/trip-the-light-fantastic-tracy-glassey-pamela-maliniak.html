  <title>Trip the Light Fantastic - Tracy Glassey, Pamela Maliniak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abigail Gray is a dance instructor whose life tragically ends at the age of thirty-four. She is welcomed to the other sidein a room of pure whiteby her guardian angel, a brown book with gold accents, a movie screen, and a remote control. With no recollection of her death, the reel commences as Abbey and her guardian angel, Michael, focus on her last year on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this year, we follow a journey of newfound love with a man named Jason, as well as a magical friendship with the spiritual intuitive who owns the towns apothecary shop. Acting as a mentor, this prestidigitator helps Abbey decipher the dreams that have been haunting her sleep since the day she bought the must have picture of a dancing couple, an item she found at the local antique shop. He also teaches her the importance of living her lifes truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the reel of Abbeys life plays out, she and Michael embark on this visual journey together, while Michael carves a wooden sculpture and offers her heavenly wisdom about lifes fragility, opportunity, and purpose.&lt;br /&gt;
Inspirational ... a perfect blend of spiritual and earthly wisdom woven through a poignant love story. &lt;br /&gt;
~Christine Duminiak, certified grief recovery specialist, author of Heaven Talks to Children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we follow Abbeys journey, we cannot help but pause for thought about our own personal beliefs and question the purpose of our own lives. The words of the author display a deep understanding of spiritual philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;
~Alison Baughman, numerologist, author of Get His Number! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a story playfully sprinkled with fascinating trivia and spiritual wonder, Tracy Glassey explores the power of all the connections and influences we dont even realize are there, and in the process conveys a great deal of wisdom and practical life lessons.&lt;br /&gt;
