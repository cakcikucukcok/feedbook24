  <title>Mastering Stress, Maximizing Success - Dr. L.L. Gill Lpc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Yes, stress is a curse, as well as, a blessing, in that it occurs in malignant, as well as, benign forms. Stress can be both constructive and destructive, in that it may open the doors of possibility, while shutting the doors of others. It is the negative side of stress that creates the overall problem for us as living beings. Stress has been known to be devastating and problematic to us. It creates difficulties for us when it does not let up; and when it is triggered by ordinary, everyday events. We are currently living in a psychologically, hyped up, exhausted, and stressed out society; whereby, we are experiencing nervous breakdowns, burnout, stress-related illnesses; and ultimately death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What am I prepared to do about this stress that I am experiencing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, there are more constructive ways of handling stress . This book is not intended to be a do-it-yourself guide to mental and emotional health, although it may provide information and insights that will direct ways toward self-improvement. This book is designed to help both individuals and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
