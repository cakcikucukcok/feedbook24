  <title>The Light Is Winning - Zach Hoag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If anyone had good reason to join the league of the &amp;ldquo;Nones,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Dones,&amp;rdquo; and the deconstructionists, it would be Zach Hoag. After growing up and out of the compound walls of a Texas cult, and becoming a failed church planter in one of the most post-Christian cities in America, Zach was faced with both a crisis and a choice. He loved Jesus, yet questioned: If the church is such a broken system, is it really worth belonging to anymore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The viral upswing of the &amp;ldquo;spiritual but not religious&amp;rdquo; trend has cast religion as going rapidly out of style. Yet even in his own desert of deconstruction, Zach couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake his desire for a spiritual home. His search ultimately led him to look behind the statistics, where Zach found an astonishing undercurrent subversively at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth, as Zach discovered, is that we are in a cultural moment of apocalypse.

Could it be that our struggle for relevance must come to a necessary end, so that we can get to the real? After all, isn&amp;rsquo;t this the essence of the story of God: death paves the way for a resurrected, deeply rooted, flourishing faith.
