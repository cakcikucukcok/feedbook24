  <title>Catholic Charities USA - J. Bryan Hehir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In honor of Catholic Charities USA&#39;s centennial celebration, this masterful work explores the development of Catholic Charities in the United States over the last one hundred years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring contributions by renowned Catholic scholars and respected leaders in the Catholic Charities movement, this work delves into the social and demographic realities that gave rise to the National Conference of Catholic Charities in 1910, the role of parishes in the development of diocesan agencies, the professionalization of social work and its impact on Catholic Charities, and the effect of church-state partnerships on the identity of Catholic charitable organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thoughtful work also explores Catholic social teaching and the theological foundation for Catholic Charities, the seminal self-studies that have shaped the direction of Catholic Charities since Vatican II, the meaning of Catholic mission and identity in a pluralistic society, the relationship between charity and justice in the work of Catholic Charities, and the role of Catholic Charities in fulfilling the social mission of the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;J. Bryan Hehir is the Parker Gilbert Montgomery Professor of the Practice of Religion and Public Life at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
