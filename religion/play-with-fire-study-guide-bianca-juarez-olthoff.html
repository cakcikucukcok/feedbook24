  <title>Play with Fire Study Guide - Bianca Juarez Olthoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this five-session video based Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately), Bianca Juarez Olthoff delivers a bible-infused message that will help women gain new insight into God&#39;s character, discover the personal and powerful nature of the Holy Spirit, and understand the unique fire God places in each person, helping them to fulfill their God-given calling and Kingdom purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire can burn and destroy but it can also refine and bring beautiful new life. In each powerful video session you will be reminded, or perhaps learn for the first time, that God has HUGE dreams for you. He&#39;s whispering in the wind and speaking through the fire and shouting in silence the extraordinary dream He is birthing in you. His dream for you is far greater than the dream you have for yourself. It&#39;s not your identity or income or influence that will make this happen. Like Zechariah 4:6 says, &quot;It&#39;s not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,&quot; says the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God isn&#39;t waiting until you have more resources or a husband or a job so he can use you. He can use you now. Stop asking when you are going to get your gifts or talents or calling and see what&#39;s in your hand. You need to play with some fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crying Out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surrender&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;God&#39;s Promises&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holy Spirit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for use with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Play with Fire Video Study&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;97803100880707 (sold separately).&lt;/p&gt;" />
