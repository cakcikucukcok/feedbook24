  <title>The Reality of the Kingdom of Demons - Dr. H. Clifton Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spiritual warfare is not a game, and the devil is not an innocent puppy. He is the master deceiver, thief, and murderer, and the force behind nearly all evil. He is full of all kinds of cruelty, pain, curses, and blight known to the human family. To survive his attacks, you must realize that the devil is a real enemy, hell-bent on destroying you. I challenge you to get serious today about determining methods to rebuke him and keep him from hindering your service to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did Satan come from? Did God create the Devil? Is God responsible for evil? Such questions plague the individual who wrestles with the existence of our adversary in the light of the Bibles revelation of the holiness of God. Philosophy can never give a satisfactory answer to these questions. The only satisfying answer is Gods answer, found in his Word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are going to combat this enemy known as Satan, then we must know his motives and his methods. Our goal in this book is to resolve this and answer many other questions as we talk about every believers responsibility in spiritual warfare.&lt;/p&gt;" />
