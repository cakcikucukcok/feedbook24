  <title>On Zechariah - R. J. Plugge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God symbolically showed Zechariah the Ten Commandments covering the promised land, and He warned of consequences. [Zec.5.3] They apply to us today too. Zechariah looked forward to a day when the exiled returnees would say. Let us go at once to entreat the Lord and seek the Lord Almighty. [8.21] They did. [Neh.8] We need to seek Him too! Zechariah foresaw the Lord would be King over the entire world. [Zec.14.9] He is!! We know Him as Jesus, Israels promised Messiah. [Mt.16.16] Within the Book of Zechariah, God declared Him my shepherd [Zec.13.7]; the man who is close to me[13.7]; my servant [3.8]; the stone with 7-eyes [3.9]; and the Branch [3.8]. Zechariah spoke of Him as the word of the lord [1.1]; the angel of the lord [1.11]; my lord [4.4]; and Jerusalems king [9.9]. The world needs to take note! He is Lord and King now! [1Cor.1.2; 1Pe.2.10; Rev.19.16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zechariah was a prophet, priest, and pretype for Jesus. He provided verifications for Jesus being the promised Messiah. God knows the end from the beginning. [e.g. Dan.2; 9; Isa.46.10; Rev.21.6] History has verified the visions given Daniel. But the words given to Zechariah through preincarnate Jesus, especially within the Oracle on Israel [12.1-14.21], are still in the process of being confirmed. [e.g. 13.9; 14.16, 20] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commentary on the Book of Zechariah is like no other. That book has been reprinted with interpretations for its pronouns and symbols inserted to reduce the frequent arbitrariness of interpretations often imposed. Millennial concepts and eschatological models are questioned. Even a suggested calendar day for Christs return is included. Many will undoubtedly take issue.&lt;/p&gt;" />
