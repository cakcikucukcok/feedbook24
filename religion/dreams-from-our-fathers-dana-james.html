  <title>Dreams from Our Fathers - DANA JAMES</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We can overcome Marxist ideas and make America great again by reconnecting with our faith and the godly principles of our Founding Fathers.Our founding fathers knew well the trouble wed find ourselves in if we did not combine faith with action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hancock warned, I conjure you, by all that is dear, by all that is honorable, by all that is sacred, not only that ye pray but that you act. Remember that where citizen complacency rules, wrong principles and policies will abound; and when it comes to sound government, the enemy is seldom them, it is generally citizen apathy.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Finney expressed similar sentiments when he said, The Church must take right ground in regards to politicsThe time has come that Christians must vote for honest men and take consistent ground in politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their words did not fall on deaf ears:  Many former Presidents believed and trusted in God, and their leadership was blessed. Like our founding fathers, they knew how important it was to support Judeo-Christian values. But an increasing number of politicians are looking to socialism and Marxist ideology to enact policiesphilosophies that have never helped America and have proved disastrous elsewhere.Its imperative that all of usDemocrats, Republicans and independentsovercome misguided ideas and recapture godly principles in Dreams From Our Fathers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We need to trust and have faith in our Creator God to help us overcome our nations challenges just as our Founding Fathers trusted God during the Revolutionary War, when only one-third of patriots fought against British tyranny and won. At present, roughly 40% of Christians vote. Troubling, but still I believe God is for us, if we would only call on Him, and do our part to save this great Republic. For our nation, our freedom, and for our children.Be active and vote, and then, vote responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
