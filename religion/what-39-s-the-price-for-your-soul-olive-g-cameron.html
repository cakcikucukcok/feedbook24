  <title>What&#39;s the Price for Your Soul? - Olive G. Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The most important thing is getting a relationship with God. You will understand what are the dos and the donts in getting and maintaining a relationship with your Heavenly Father.
In, Whats The Price For Your Soul, Olive G. Cameron strips away the confusion and gives biblical clarity on helping you to draw closer to the One that created you. The One who loves you enough, to do whatever it takes to help you with all of the horrific, horrendous and tragic situations that you may have gone through in life. 
You will learn why you may be in that particular situation that youre in and how God expect you to react, how to respond and what you can do to get out of it. You will also learn what is your part in all of this and how to counter act when the devil throws obstacles your way. Olive lays out the principles for dealing with-and avoiding-the problems and pit falls we may face in our everyday life." />
