  <title>Make a Way for Your Rescue - David Piper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of lives were lost following the sinking of the Titanic because the owners, believing their ship was unsinkable, neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats. If you believe your heart is unsinkable then you also have decided you dont need a rescue boat. But if you have an addictive behavior interfering with your daily activities, your relationships, and even your will to live, you have a sinking feeling deep in your soul. Since your heart is sinkable how can you be rescued?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Make a Way for Your Rescue you will be challenged to examine your heart to confirm its sinkable condition. The scriptural explanations will show you why you need a heart transplant, how to believe for a new beginning, and inspire you to follow through on commitments. You make a way for your rescue when you come to realize that these scriptural truths are a lifeboat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lifeboat scene we see the hand of a rescuer reaching for the hand of a victim. Your study of these truths brings within your reach the stretched-out arm of your Rescuer. When you reach for His hand He will grasp yours and give you a heart exactly like His. This new heart has the endurance to get you through every storm and the assurance to get you through Heavens gate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
