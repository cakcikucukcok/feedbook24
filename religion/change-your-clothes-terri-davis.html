  <title>Change Your Clothes - Terri Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was inspired to write about several events that occurred through my transition of change. Changing hasnt always come easily; in fact, the more I think about it, I was not even considering changing my way of living until God stepped into my life and began ministering to me. My whole world turned in a different and unfamiliar direction. I was afraid and on many occasions paralyzed by the fear of moving from my familiar way of life. I was sometimes disobedient, for when God wanted me to go one way I would go the other. I had to repent! The moment I allowed change was the moment I began my journey to destiny. 
Change is very common in the world we live in. With technology, markets up and down, our children growing up (they are not infants anymore, and neither are we!), it is evident that we experience change but the question is will we accept it in our hearts. I can say that with God it will be a more pleasant transition. Change is going to come whether we are ready for it or not; so I encourage you to embrace change as it comes. It may not be easy but it is always good. It may be joyous for some, and so unexpected for others that many may change kicking and screaming. Whether you are the kicker or screamer, remember to repent. The key is to change. 
God told Jacob to gather his people and go up to Bethel to worship and to put away their idols (see Genesis 35:25). God is calling us to do the same. He wants us to experience everything that he created us for, which will only come with our changing. As you walk with me through these pages, I hope that you will not just laugh but think about how important it is for your future that you do change. Most of all, I pray that you will connect with this writing and use it as a tool to move forward. These testimonies are from my heart to yours in hope that you will see there are so many in this world going through similar changes and to assure you that you are not alone.
Never did I think the day would come when I would be sharing a part of my life with an audience or be fortunate enough to share my testimonies with you. Well, this day has come, and it came because I became hungry for change. I hope that as you read, you will discover your potential to change and do so now.
May our God richly bless you!
