  <title>Give Your Child the World - Jamie C. Martin, Tsh Oxenreider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Young children live with awe and wonder as their daily companions. But as they grow, worries often crowd out wonder. Knowing this, how can parents strengthen their kids&amp;rsquo; love for the world so it sticks around for the long haul?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, parents have at their fingertips a miracle vaccine&amp;mdash;one that can boost their kids&#39; immunity to the world&amp;rsquo;s distractions. Well-chosen stories connect us with others, even those on the other side of the globe. Build your kids&amp;rsquo; lives on a story-solid foundation and you&amp;rsquo;ll give them armor to shield themselves from the world&amp;rsquo;s cynicism. You&amp;rsquo;ll give them confidence to persevere in the face of life&amp;rsquo;s conflicts. You&amp;rsquo;ll give them a reservoir of compassion that spills over into a lifetime of love in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give Your Child the World&lt;/em&gt; features inspiring stories, practical suggestions, and carefully curated reading lists of the best children&amp;rsquo;s literature for each area of the globe. Reading lists are organized by region, country, and age range (ages 4-12). Each listing includes a brief description of the book, its themes, and any content of which parents should be aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can introduce their children to the world from the comfort of home by simply opening a book together. &lt;em&gt;Give Your Child the World&lt;/em&gt; is poised to become a bestselling family reading treasury that promotes literacy, develops a global perspective, and strengthens family bonds while increasing faith and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
