  <title>Secular Music, Sacred Space - April Stace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Easter Sunday, 2009, was the Sunday heard &amp;lsquo;round the evangelical internet: NewSpring Church, the second-largest church in the Southern Baptist Convention and among the top one hundred largest churches in the US, had begun their service with the song &amp;ldquo;Highway to Hell&amp;rdquo; by hard rock band AC/DC. They had brazenly crossed the sacred/secular musical divide on the most important Sunday of the year, and commentary abounded on the value of such a step. Many were offended at the &amp;ldquo;desecration&amp;rdquo; of such a holy day, deriding Newspring as the &amp;ldquo;theater of the absurd.&amp;rdquo; Others cheered NewSpring&amp;rsquo;s engagement with &amp;ldquo;the culture&amp;rdquo; and suggested that music could be used to convert non-Christians. No mere debate over stylistic preferences, many expressed that foundational aspects of evangelical identity were at stake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many books have been written about religious music that utilizes popular music styles (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;contemporary Christian music&amp;rdquo;), there has yet to be a scholarly treatment of how and why popular, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;secular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; music is utilized by churches. This book addresses that lacuna by examining this emerging trend in evangelical and &amp;ldquo;emerging&amp;rdquo; churches in America. What is the motivation behind using music that seemingly has no connection to Christian theology, values, or themes&amp;mdash;such as music by Katy Perry, AC/DC, or Van Halen&amp;mdash;and what can we learn about post-denominational evangelical churches in America by uncovering these motives? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this book, April Stace uncovers several themes from an ethnographic study of these churches: the increasingly-porous boundary between the sacred and the secular, the importance placed on &amp;ldquo;authenticity&amp;rdquo; in contemporary American culture, how evangelicals are responding to what they perceive is an increasingly-secular society, the &amp;ldquo;turn to the subject&amp;rdquo; of contemporary culture, the desire to leave a space for expression of doubt in the worship service without fully authorizing that doubt, and the individualization of the construction of religious identity in the modern era.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
