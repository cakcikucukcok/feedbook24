  <title>Up from the Ashes - William Landon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each of us goes through life on a search for the truth. We may do this ether consciously or subconsciously but the journey is a part of our living. Please understand that this is not some theoretical exercise. The search for truth is vital for us to make correct decisions in all aspects of our life. As such, this is one of the most important understandings we can come to as human beings.
The search for truth is actually the search for reality and the nature of reality. Thus, this is an important part of meaningful living. How successful we are going to be in living is heavily reliant on how clearly and correctly we understand the true nature of reality. It is for this reason that this is no mere philosophical exercise.
This book is an exploration of the Bibles view of reality. Contrary to popular opinion there is only one ultimate truth. We need to reject the misconception that reality is subjective. This is the error Pontus Pilate expressed to Christ (John 18:38) and that the Athenian Greeks proposed to the apostle Paul (Acts 17:1921). Yet, the true nature of life is that there is only one real truth. Given the impact our understanding of truth has on our life here and now as well as in eternity, there is no more important pursuit a person can undertake. This book puts forth the view of truth that is based on the teachings of the Bible." />
