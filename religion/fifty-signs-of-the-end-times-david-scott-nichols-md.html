  <title>Fifty Signs of the End Times - David Scott Nichols  Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world is on an inexorable path toward the apocalypse, currently exhibiting many of the Bibles prophesied signs of the end times. When the Jews regained nationhood in May 1948, the countdown began toward the promised return of the Messiah. In &lt;i&gt;Fifty Signs of the End Times&lt;/i&gt;, compelling new information is shared demonstrating that the end-time clock is nearing midnight, including:&lt;/p&gt;
 How the alignment of the nations soon to come against Israel is exactly as prophesied in the Bible.&lt;br&gt;
 The many ways that God has honored His promise to richly bless Israel in the latter days  including the discovery of new energy sources.&lt;br&gt;
 Recent and detailed information concerning the coming Tribulation Temple.&lt;br&gt;
 Amazing accounts demonstrating how God is pouring out His Spirit in these latter days.&lt;br&gt;
 How God has miraculously protected Israel in its recent wars.&lt;br&gt;
 Revealing how twelve of Christs prophecies in His Olivet Discourse have come true in our time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Nichols explains these intriguing signs, and dozens more, in meticulous detail. We are fast approaching Armageddon. However, this need not cause alarm. God has provided an escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have well over fifty prophecy volumes in my library and can honestly say that none display more of the detailed and accurate research as seen in this book. Every prophecy student worth his salt needs to read it!&lt;br&gt;
---Dr. H.L. Willmington, Founder and Dean, Liberty Home Bible Institute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Nichols has written an excellent study on the signs of the end times. His biblical knowledge, medical and scientific perspective, and analysis of the culture make this an incredible study. Dont miss it.&lt;br&gt;
