  <title>The Discovery of Witches - Mathew Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Discovery of Witches by Mathew Hopkins.&lt;/b&gt; There was much superstition and ignorance in 17th century England. Witchcraft had been illegal since 1563 and hundreds of women were wrongly accused and punished. &amp;#39;Proof&amp;#39; of being a witch could be a third nipple, an unusual scar or birthmark, a boil, a growth, or even owning a cat or other pet (a &amp;#39;witch&amp;#39;s familiar&amp;#39;, or evil spirit). Confessions were often made under torture, and suspects were tied up and thrown into a river or pond. Floating was proof of guilt. After a show trial, the victim was hanged. Professionals who exposed witches could make a lot of money, as local magistrates paid the witch finder the equivalent of a month&amp;#39;s wages. And the busiest tradesman of all was Matthew Hopkins, a shadowy figure who called himself &amp;#39;Witchfinder General&amp;#39; and had around 300 women executed in East Anglia during the turmoil of the English Civil War in 1645 and 1646. The book shown here is from Hopkins&amp;#39;s 1647 book &amp;#39;The Discovery of Witches&amp;#39;, in which he describes his grim profession." />
