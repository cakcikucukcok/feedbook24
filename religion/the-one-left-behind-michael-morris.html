  <title>The One Left Behind - Michael Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charmaine, Mikes wife of forty-three years, lived with cancer for nearly eight years until two years ago. Then Jesus came back for her as he had promised. He took her to be where he is in his Fathers house where he had prepared a home for her. He lifted her up on eagles wings and took her to himself. The cancer is now dead, but Charmaine lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Mike and Charmaines story. It is a story of hope from the one left behinda role that one day so many of us will be called upon to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It tells of Gods goodness and how he is even gooder than we thinkall the time. This they discovered through their circumstances, not despite them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike has personally known Jesus as Lord in his life for over twenty years and Lord of his life in more recent years. For longer than that, he has travelled the world in sales and manufacturing roles, having lived and worked extensively in China, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, the United States, and Israel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has a daughter living in Canada with her husband and four children whom he visits two to three times per year. Originally from Manchester, Mike returned to live there recently after a fifty-year absence to be close to his brother, his wife, and two nieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike is still working, building a business consulting to manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
