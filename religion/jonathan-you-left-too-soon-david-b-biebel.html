  <title>Jonathan, You Left Too Soon - David B Biebel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A classic in-depth, extremely honest first person account of grief from the loss of a child. First published in 1981, this book will help those dealing with a similar loss or those who wish to better understand and help family or friends who may be struggling with such a loss.  In his foreword, Charles Swindoll wrote, &quot;Stunned yet courageous, this pastor recorded his feelings, his questions, his guilt, his struggles, and even his bitterness. As you read his words, you will nod with understanding and weep with compassion. Your heart will beat heavily as you identify with his profound sends of loss ... Not since Joe Bayly&#39;s A view from the Hearse have I found myself more in agreement. To this author, grief is real; it dare not be denied or ignored. Yes, its wounds must be handled with care and given time to heal. Preserving us from pious platitudes and empty clichés, David Biebel says it straight and he says it well. Best of all, he doesn&#39;t attempt to answer all the whys. Old Joseph Parker [who said that there is a broken heart in every pew] would have appreciated David&#39;s style and content. I certainly do. So will you.&quot;  This is an intensely personal story of how one man, as a father and minister, came to terms with his bereavement and experienced a more mature realization of his faith. Both touching and inspiring, Jonathan: You Left Too Soon offers strength and reassurance to those who hurt, encouraging them on their journey through brokenness toward a greater sense of wholeness." />
