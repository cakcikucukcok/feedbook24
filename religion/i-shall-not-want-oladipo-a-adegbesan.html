  <title>I Shall Not Want - Oladipo A. Adegbesan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Shall Not Want is a book that everyone who wants to enjoy the goodness of God forever must read. Not only read, but also meditate on, practice, and trust God as the Good Shepherd, the author and finisher of our faith. It will reveal to you the mind and will of God for your life. It will also teach you how to develop a mature life of prayer, in order to establish a good relationship with God. Emphasis on the principles of Gods prosperity, his promises to supply all your needs in this life, and the kingdom to come, and your abilities to claim these promises were carefully uncovered. By the special grace of God, this book will lead and guide you progressively through the process of living an abundant life, while not being in want of any good thing. It dwells richly on such topics as:
 The power in speaking the word of God with faith and belief;
  the importance and benefits of prayer and fasting;
  the essence of living a peaceful and faithful life, and many more. 
	This book is very inspiring, encouraging, educational, and powerful. It is written in simplified language for easy reading and understanding. Each chapter begins with one or more scriptural passages, useful definitions of terms, adequate, and appropriate Bible memory verses, and a conclusion section that summarizes the chapter. I have tried to make the book less voluminous so that it can be read within a short period of time, and be read over and over again. You are encouraged to read it with an open mind. I pray that you will find this book very useful. May the good God open your spiritual mind, and grant you the grace to know the truth and be able to practice that truth, so, that truth that you know can set you free. All scriptural passages are taken from the King James Version (KJV) unless stated otherwise.
