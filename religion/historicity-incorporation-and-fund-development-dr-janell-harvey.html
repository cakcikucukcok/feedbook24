  <title>Historicity, Incorporation and Fund Development - Dr. Janell Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith-based organizations address a myriad of needs in communities both domestic and abroad. Leaders, new to the field, often lack the strategies needed to successfully secure funds, file form 1023, audit their annual programmatic goals and hold their board of directors accountable.  Through a process of understanding the historicity of the faith-based sector, establishing plans and learning the fundamentals of non-profit development, new leaders can position themselves to lead the charge towards establishing bona-fide faith-based organizations. This book is composed of those fundamental areas. In addition to such processes, this book also looks at the mission of Apostle Paul as he led a purpose driven life to establish churches in the Roman Empire and his commitment to the benevolent offering. Clearly, those working the field of Christian philanthropy can use Paul as a model figure as they seek to establish worthwhile causes that meet the needs of people universally.
This book examines both the historical and current impact that faith-based organizations have on society. Included are the steps for individuals interested in establishing an NGO (non-governmental organization) and seeking funds. Worksheets are also provided. 
The author, Dr. Janell N. Harvey is a seasoned proposal developer who has established a number of non-profit organizations while helping to garner millions in funds.
&quot;Dr, Harvey&#39;s research presents a worthwhile model that is easily adaptable within the faith based sector. Clearly, her reference to Apostle Paul&#39;s work is legitimate as he is a model figure within the Christian faith&quot; Attorney Trai Irving Esq." />
