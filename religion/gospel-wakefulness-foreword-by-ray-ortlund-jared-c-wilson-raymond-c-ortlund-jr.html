  <title>Gospel Wakefulness (Foreword by Ray Ortlund) - Jared C. Wilson, Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We may know the gospel. We may believe it&amp;mdash;even proclaim it. But we also may assume the gospel and become lethargic. In this book Jared Wilson seeks to answer the central question, how do we experience and present the gospel in a fresh, nonroutine way in order to prevent ourselves and others from becoming numb? His answer may be surprising: &amp;ldquo;by routinely presenting the unchanging gospel in a way that does justice to its earth-shaking announcement.&amp;rdquo; We don&amp;rsquo;t excite and awaken people to the glorious truths of the gospel by spicing up our worship services or through cutting-edge, dramatic rhetoric, but by passionately and faithfully proclaiming the same truths we have already been given in Scripture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson&amp;rsquo;s book will stir churches to live out the power of the gospel with a fervent, genuine zeal. After an explanation of the term &amp;ldquo;gospel wakefulness,&amp;rdquo; Wilson unpacks implications for worship, hyper-spirituality, godly habits, and sanctification, as well as other aspects of church life. Pastors, church leaders, and all in ministry, especially those who are tired or discouraged, will be uplifted, emboldened, and empowered by this book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
