  <title>Hope in the Midst - Mary Rose Takacs, Marianne Takacs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dont give up! &lt;br&gt;
Are you struggling to hold on to your faith? Authors Marianne and Mary Rose Takacs find themselves in such a place in 1998. During the spring, ten-year-old Mary Rose is experiencing mysterious health symptoms. In the summer, a terrifying diagnosis is given. Being warned by the physical therapist she may never walk again, Mary Rose is determined she will not spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. &lt;p&gt;
Follow the journeys of mother and daughter in this thirty-day devotional, as they face the battles within and those that surround them. With raw honesty, humor, and inspiration, they describe their struggles and God-given triumphs. You will read about the courage and perseverance needed to overcome life-changing circumstances. Share in their stories of the lessons they learn and the comfort they find in Christ. These real life experiences will encourage you and bring Hope in the Midst.&lt;p&gt;
They touch on such topics as:&lt;br&gt;
	Calming the Storm Within&lt;br&gt;
	Laughter that Soothes&lt;br&gt;
	Remembering His Benefits&lt;br&gt;
	The Battle is the Lords&lt;br&gt; 
	The Value of Life, and much more!&lt;br&gt;" />
