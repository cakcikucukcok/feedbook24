  <title>Inferiority Complex - Lanre Ajiboye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The idea to write the book, Inferiority Complex did not just come out of the blues. Since I came across the statement that a child is born without character or personality there is not a time that the statement has a greater influence on me than when I started out to write this book. This is because, I could not have found a better opportunity to understudy a divergent group of people than I found in my capacity as the then Supervisory Councillor for Health and Medical Services of Ilesa East Local Government Council, in Osun State of Nigeria.
Be that as it may, I should just briefly state here that this five-chapter book has taken cognizance of psychological, physiological, sociological, physical, genetic, mystical, religious, societal, and environmental factors on the emergence or otherwise of inferiority complex in individuals, and the inevitable effects it brings to bear on the development and well-being of society and its prevention or remedial precautions as applicable." />
