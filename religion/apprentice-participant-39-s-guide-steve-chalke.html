      <meta name="description" content="The quest for meaning and purpose dwells within all of us.  Jesus insisted that its fulfillment lay in a relationship with him.  But what does that look like-really?  Apprentice encourages us to ask our most probing questions, embrace our doubts and learn why we are driven to belong. Designed for use with the Apprentice five-session DVD study, use this participant’s guide as you follow bestselling author Steve Chalke in guiding us into a deep experience of learning and relationship with Jesus.  Embarking on a relational journey that engages us on every level, we learn to walk with Jesus in an organic, whole-life learning experience, exploring areas foundational to the meaning and depth we crave.  In five sessions the author covers the following topics.•Journeying:  Life is like a journey best walked one step at a time•Longing:  Satisfaction comes from longing for the things God longs for •Believing:  Our knowledge is always limited, in the end we have to put our trust in something•Questioning:  Without room for doubt, faith could not exist•Belonging:  Living in community requires trust and love.  It is dangerous and risky, but ultimately worth the risk" />
