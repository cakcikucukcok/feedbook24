  <title>God&#39;s Big Bang Theory: What Your Teachers Didn&#39;t Tell You - Christian Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The principles of scientific study and evolution have had a huge impact on what we believe in the ordinary world and as Christians. This has over time created a generation that laughs at the mention of God or a Savior. Preferring to put their faith in science, evolution has now become their religion and the geologic column is their bible. Evolution has spread like a disease into every branch of science taught in school.By their first year of college most students have lost all faith in God.But what do &quot;Christian&quot; scientists have to say about the creation of the universe? Did dinosaurs live side by side with man? Is there scientific evidence that is contrary to what is taught in school? What did the teachers leave out and what does the Bible say about God&#39;s Big Bang Theory?" />
