      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is awaiting you after you close your eyes to open them in the eternity? What is awaiting you after your body returns to the dust of the earth? Is there a heaven and is there a hell that awaits your destination? Discussions concerning is heaven real or is hell real has become &amp;ldquo;void&amp;rdquo; in the church&amp;rsquo;s pulpits today. Many that are talking about heaven is not going to walk through one of those pearly gates and many that are refusing to address the topic of hell is going to be surprised. The Biblical standards of this topic is not being addressed according to the Word of God. Yes, Virginia, there is a heaven and there is a hell. It is your choice; however, it is God&amp;rsquo;s decision where each dwell in eternity. Always remember as you read this book, &amp;ldquo;Heaven is the place to go; Hell is too hot, and Eternity is too long.&amp;rdquo; Looking at heaven and hell in this book, will help you realize and give you time to think about the end, &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rsquo;s Decision&amp;rdquo;. Everyone wants to leave God out of the equation, but He is the equation. At our birth, we had an appointment with life and at our death, we have an appointment with death. Life and death walk hand in hand with us throughout their lives with each waking day. Sometimes they separate, we have good days and we have bad days. Then one day, they come together for the last time. Life and death will have a quarrel and on that final day, death will win because the God the equation has spoken, it is appointed unto man once to die and then the judgment (decision), Hebrews 9:27. Heaven and hell is not a figment of your imagination, they are real.&lt;/p&gt;" />
