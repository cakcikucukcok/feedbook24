  <title>Seek - Katie McCreary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There was an exceptional woman who truly knew and loved her king. She witnessed true love and all the exceptional things. Heaven had brought His Majesty his soul mate. They were inseparable. Blinded by his glorious face, she tells him, Ill see you later. Yet they were always together, and they were always worth it. Bad choices and sin were always popping up, step by step and bit by bit, but she was always beautiful to him. Their chemistry was marvelous, and everything was perfect, with or without sin separating them faithfully, or driving a wedge until faithful didnt feel so wonderful. Thats when faithful was only a mystery, and forgiveness didnt seem like the way home until Faithful was his dying name.
The gift of true unfailing love is of no practical magic, no fairy dust, and, of course nothing in any chapter book that can explain what is truly precedent about our transformation when your elected unto the 144,000 saints, to keep our robes clean without spot or blemish, holy, and without blame. The holy grail of partnership is not an overstatement when referencing to what this romantic couple shares." />
