  <title>Inspirational Messages on Life&#39;s Journey - Becky Morphew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our life&#39;s journey takes us through many different valleys and atop many mountains! We must completely trust God to guide us in each part of these journeys. This book &quot;Inspirational Messages on Life&#39;s Journey&quot; has been in the works for ten years. Little did I know when God spoke to me and told me to start writing and sending out monthly newsletters through our ministry, Sweet Aroma Ministry, that one day the articles would be compiled into a book. The articles were inspired by the different life&#39;s journey, we have experienced when we were atop the mountains or deep in the valleys. One can only speak and write, what one knows and experiences. My prayer for each of you is that somewhere hidden in the recesses of this book, you discover yourself. I pray one of my experiences will enable you to find guidance and understanding in your next step in your lifes journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
