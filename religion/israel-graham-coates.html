  <title>Israel - Graham Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book looks at many of the issues that fill our news bulletins daily concerning the tiny nation of Israel. For centuries, Jews have been subjected to horrendous abuses. In the opening chapters, we examine the root cause of anti-Semitism and debunk replacement theology, one of the most insidious heresies in the church today. Both anti-Semitism and replacement theology are tools the devil uses to undermine Gods love for Israel and faithfulness to the covenant he made with Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most misinterpreted Old Testament prophecies is now being fulfilled before our eyes. Ezekiels vision of a valley of dry dead bones has so often been used to describe a church that is in desperate need of revival. In the remaining chapters, we look at this prophecy in its proper context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dry bones are coming together, following the birth of the State of Israel in 1947. Jews from all over the world are returning to the land that was promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The dry bones have grown muscle and have transformed a desert into an oasis. Israel has grown into a major international power, as seen by Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, God is not yet finished with his people, and in the last chapter, we see what God says is Israels future. It is a glorious future! It will usher in his return and the establishment of his throne in the city of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;" />
