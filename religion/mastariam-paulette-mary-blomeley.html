  <title>Mastariam - Paulette Mary Blomeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Marsane and Valara were chosen to come to earth from their home planet Ziama, residing in the twelfth dimension. In this dimension, they were one being. Not until they lived on earth did they realize how harsh it could be to be separated into two souls and to drop ones vibration so low. Once the wheel of destiny had begun to turn, there would be no turning back. They had begun the experience of being human and could not return to their source until they had experienced and completed a cycle, which could be hundreds of thousands of years. Here is their story, their beginning of being human, and the enormous shock that was to come to them in learning what the future heldpain and suffering until they could eventually return to their original advanced state of consciousness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Their star family, especially Oriam and Stariam, would be there to guide them at all times, especially the many times they both wanted to give up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Marsane pledged to do all he could to keep balance on planet earth. He had no idea what was in store for him, committing himself to such a grand task.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The time on earth for them to come back together is now!&lt;/P&gt;" />
