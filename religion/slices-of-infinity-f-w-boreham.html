  <title>Slices of Infinity - F. W. Boreham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like the previously published Nuggets of Romance this is the first time these F. W. Boreham writings have been offered in a book. When I read these biographical sketches I am reminded that all of life is meaningful. Boreham writes about a variety of people.
