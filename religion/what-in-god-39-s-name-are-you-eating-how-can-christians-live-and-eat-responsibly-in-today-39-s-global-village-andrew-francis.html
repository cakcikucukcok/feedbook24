  <title>What in God&#39;s Name Are You Eating?: How Can Christians Live and Eat Responsibly in Today&#39;s Global Village? - Andrew Francis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How you eat affects the planet--and everyone else on it. What you eat might literally cost the earth. But it has implications for your health, the grower or producer, and the way you think about the world. What in God&#39;s Name Are You Eating? is full of questions and information to help you and those you live and work with reflect on major issues about food and lifestyle. Andrew Francis is a community theologian who grows vegetables and fruit in his backyard, bakes bread, and cooks for family, friends, coworkers, and his students. He is an artist and poet who puts his hands in the earth, who has traveled widely and has eaten with many and is still learning from different races, faiths, and cultures. What in God&#39;s Name Are You Eating? is about how we live now so that the world&#39;s peoples might have life and a long future. While the reflection is rooted in radical Mennonite Christianity, the challenge is to those of faith (and of none). This book invites you to &quot;choose life.&quot;" />
