  <title>God’S Intelligent Design for Planet Earth - Mike Morra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about God the Creator of all; from nothingness to beyond the Multiverse, from cosmic darkness to spiritual light, while surrounding all of His Creation with universal beauty.  Godless scholars claim their discoveries as the engine of historic progress, but in truth it has been the Divine revelation of ideas that have propelled the evolution of Mankind.  Often, we are discovering that the greatest of human genius has been wrong in their attempts to explain the physical basics of existence. Likewise, their vision of the natural world and the course of cultural/spiritual advancement have been flawed. Albert Einsteins theories were wrong.  Even he admitted that his universal constant that attempted to describe the mechanics of Outer Space was a colossal miscalculation.  The philosophies of the most noteworthy of Greek intellectuals, Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato, widely taught today in academia as the pathway to truth, have failed to anticipate the Mosaic, Moral Order and Gods personal relationship with each human soul.  Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling proposed a triple-helix for the DNA and he was proven wrong.  Along with, the mathematical limitations posed by Isaac Newton and Rene Descartes.  Galileos science, atomic theory, quantum physics, string theory, Darwins biology, Freuds account of the psyche, and many other intellectual gaffes made throughout the Eras have been proven erroneous and/or partial truths.  Has the acquisition of knowledge been a continuous, rational phenomenon leading to truth?  Or, will godless reasoning always be imperfect to grasp the Divine complexities of the cosmos?  Why cant rational mathematics explain the irrational numbers, such as the Fibonacci series, the Golden Proportion, and the triangular ratios of sine, cosine, and hypotenuse?  Has Gods wisdom been revealing to scholars the rudiments of His Creation throughout the Eras or have the godless, arrogant intellectuals been discovering the created fundamentals of the cosmos, as revealed through time by a Higher Power?   Has the issuing of the Nobel Prize been sacrosanct or simply the rewarding of scientific mistakes and limitations via political/cultural correctness?   Only God and the message of Jesus have perfectly survived to inspire the ideational and spiritual Ages." />
