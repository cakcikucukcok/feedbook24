  <title>Jesus&#39; Second Coming?  Oh, Please Not Yet - Donald Werner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having grown up in the church, and then as a seminary student, I have been bothered by the differences between what I read in the Scriptures and what the Churches teach and practice.  As hard as I tried I couldn&#39;t reconcile the two. Studying God&#39;s word alone shows me clearly that the Church has drifted off it&#39;s Scriptural foundation and has itself firmly anchored in human and church traditions.  When you read this book you will see how those that are following the churches teachings are not ready for Judgment Day. God will harshly judge the church, and most of Christianity is not at all ready for Judgment Day - though they think they are.  This book will prepare you for that Day." />
