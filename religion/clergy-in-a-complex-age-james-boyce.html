  <title>Clergy in a Complex Age - James Boyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This highly readable book explains the scope and detail of the newly revised Guidelines for the professional conduct of the clergy, which shape and define how clergy should act and behave. The book brings together a number of experts in the field, who draw on the Ordinal (as the basis of the Guidelines), writing engagingly on key elements in the life of clergy today. 
Paula Gooder wrestles with the exhilaratingly tricky question, ‘What would Jesus do?’ 
John Pritchard responds with characteristic humour and wisdom to the challenge of remaining ‘white hot in our desire for God year after year’.
Robert Innes draws on his unexpected call to the ministry while meditating on Jesus’ self-sacrificial pastoral leadership.
Paul Butler writes with authority and compassion about the complexities of safeguarding.
Jamie Harrison reflects on the humility, cost and joy of ‘telling the story of God’s love’.
Russ Parker finds that blessing others means being vulnerable and empathetic to the pain common to us all.
Stephen Cherry offers witty yet powerful insights on giving leadership.
Kate Bruce writes captivatingly on imagination as indispensable to the life of faith.
Magdalen Smith illuminates the creative tension of living faithfully in public and private.
David Walker assures us that the very wounds we bear from our journeys so far enable us to minister to others.
‘Faithful relationships are fundamental to maintaining and improving the life of the Church. It is my fervent desire that increasing trust, particularly that which flows from trustworthy clergy, will transform God’s world.’ 
Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, from the Foreword" />
