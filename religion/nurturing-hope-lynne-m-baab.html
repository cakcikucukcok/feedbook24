  <title>Nurturing Hope - Lynne M. Baab</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trends and skills for those who offer pastoral care&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian pastoral care has changed a great deal in the past few decades in response to many factors in our rapidly changing world. In part 1 of &lt;i&gt;Nurturing Hope&lt;/i&gt;, Lynne Baab discusses seven trends in pastoral care--shifts in who delivers pastoral care, the attitudes and commitments that undergird pastoral care, and societal trends that are shaping pastoral care today. She illustrates them with stories from diverse congregations where Christian caregivers are meeting those challenges in creative and exciting ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the book, Baab presents four practical, doable, energizing skills needed by pastoral carers in our time. Focusing on skills that help carers nurture connections between everyday life and Christian faith, she explores the need for carers to understand common stressors, listen, pray with others, and nurture their personal resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded in an understanding of God as the true caregiver and healer, the author offers tips for readers who are training other pastoral carers or developing their own understanding and skills. Each chapter ends with discussion and reflection questions, making the book helpful for groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynne Baab brings readers hope for their caring role and for their own spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
