This version of the BCP contains the complete content of the authorized Book of Common Prayer 1979. Fully searchable and featuring a built-in Table of Contents, this eBook BCP was designed to make content accessible on mobile devices and tablets.

These eBooks give Episcopalians easy access to the Book of Common Prayer, making it as close as your tablet or eBook reader.
