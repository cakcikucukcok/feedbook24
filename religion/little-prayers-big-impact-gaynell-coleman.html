  <title>Little Prayers, Big Impact - Gaynell Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gaynell Coleman never considered writing nor did she set out to write a bookshe struggled for years to communicate with others. She never gave up on improving her communication skills. She knew deep within that she had the ability; however, she struggled with anger issues, which hindered her success of improving her interpersonal effectiveness. She remained focused on her goals. In 1979 Coleman landed a job at the public library where she shelved books returned by patrons. She discovered the inspirational section where the possibility for learning and improving herself were endless. And now, in Little Prayers, Big Impact, she is sharing part of her story to help you become all that you were created to be.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person is born with a yearning to be loved, acknowledged, and accepted for who they are. The longing is like a hole in your heart that when the right connection is made there is nothing and no one that can ever sever it. You know that you are complete and have been made whole. The void has been filled because the things that once mattered, such as material possessions, accumulation of wealth, job status, or physical appearances have little meaning. Those things that once disturbed you cannot shake the foundation of which you stand. Little Prayers, Big Impact is your road map to wholeness. It is the key to delayering to get to the heart of the real you.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Prayers, Big Impact will inspire you. It will encourage you. It will change your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
