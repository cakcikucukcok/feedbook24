  <title>Journey from Heartache to Hope - Elizabeth G. Danielsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Witness Gods miraculous healing power. Have you ever asked yourself if God still performs miracles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience the remarkable stories of pain and grief that have been transformed to celebrations of joy in Christ. Your spirit will be renewed by the faith of people in devastating situations that should rob them of happiness and comfort, but instead bring strength and courage to their lives. Travel the twisted road of grief with people who have experienced the suffering that life can bring, and have discovered the path of healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In todays society, grief is frequently swept aside to avoid awkward moments and cover our inability to cope. Faith communities, friends, and family are often unprepared for the depth of pain that can be experienced, and many in need of comfort do not receive it. Journey from Heartache to Hope illustrates what is possible when people learn to rely on God to provide them with the arms of comfort. He is the safe place for us to mourn, grow, and live our lives in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share in the journey of unbearable pain, and you will be amazed at the glory of God. You will be given the details usually reserved for the ears of the counselors who guide individuals through the complex tragedies that life can bring. Feel the changes of the spirit and rejoice in the healing that only the Lord can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us on the journey from heartache to hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
