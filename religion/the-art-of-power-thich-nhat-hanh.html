  <title>The Art of Power - Thich Nhat Hanh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Power is good for one thing only: to increase our happiness and the happiness of others. Being peaceful and happy is the most important thing in our lives and yet most of the time we suffer, we run after our cravings, we look to the past or the future for our happiness.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning our conventional understanding of power on its head, world-renowned Zen master, spiritual leader, and national bestselling author Thich Nhat Hanh reveals how true power comes from within. What we seek, we already have. Whether we want it or not, power remains one of the central issues in all of our lives. Every day, each of us exercises power in many ways, and our every act subtly affects the world we live in. This struggle for control and authority permeates every aspect of our private and public lives, preventing us from attaining true happiness. The me-first mentality in our culture seeps unnoticed into our decisions and choices. Our bottom-line approach to getting ahead may be most visible in the business world, but the stress, fear, and anxiety it causes are being felt by people in all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With colorful anecdotes, precise language, and concrete practices, Thich Nhat Hanh illustrates how the current understanding of power leads us on a never-ending search for external markers like job title or salary. &lt;em&gt;The Art of Power&lt;/em&gt; boldly challenges our assumptions and teaches each of us how to access the true power that is within our grasp.&lt;/p&gt;" />
