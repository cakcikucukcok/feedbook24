  <title>Reading the Bible Again For the First Time - Marcus J. Borg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the vital challenges facing thoughtful people today is how to read the Bible faithfully without abandoning our sense of truth and history. &lt;em&gt;Reading the Bible Again for the First Time&lt;/em&gt; provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined&amp;#8212;in an approach the author calls &quot;historical-metaphorical.&quot; Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible&#39;s origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique book invites everyone&amp;#8212;whatever one&#39;s religious background&amp;#8212;to engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
