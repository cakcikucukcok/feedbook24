  <title>E-Mails from the Underworld - Rev. Thomas F. O&#39;Donnell Esq.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im mad as Hell, and Im not going to take it any more.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So begins Satans autobiography,  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;E-MAILS FROM THE UNDERWORLD:  I AM NOT WHO I AM NOT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  So long as God remained Out There,a transcendent, superhero who occasionally intervened in human affairs based on no apparent rhyme or reason, Satan was comfortable with the arrangement.  God -- Out There.  Satan  in here.  That&#39;s the way it was supposed to be.  But with the publication of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I AM WHO I AM:  AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF GOD,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; it&#39;s a whole new game.   In his mind, Satan, a metaphorical symbol for all the inner demons that keep humankind imprisoned within,  has no choice but to come out with his own story.  God has laid down the gauntlet;  now it is time to respond, he proclaims.  Let the best (or worst) deity win. 	
	&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And Satan is a cocky cuss.  When it comes to laying claim to an inner presence within, his confidence runneth over.  As he himself puts it, Im your inner demons.  Im Anger, Envy, Lust, Pride.  Im Greed, Impatience, Sloth.  Im Judgmentalism, Im Bigotry, Im Stereotyping, Im all the sneaky little -isms and -igotries that allow you humanoids to think youre better than somebody else.  You all know Im deep down inside every one of you.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The story of Satan is a story of erupting from within.  But  Satan isnt just going to tell his lifes story, hes going to show it to you.  E-mail by e-mail.  From tweaking the Beatitudes to the Bad Dude&#39;s Baditudes,&quot;  to offering a new set of Ten Commandments to Hell, Satan takes you on a roller-coaster ride of your own inner demons.  By books end, a conscientious reader will have picked up more than enough tricks of the trade to insure a speedy and successful trip to metaphorical Hell (not to mention, of course, the ways to avoid it).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;E-MAILS FROM THE UNDERWORLD:  I AM NOT WHO I AM NOT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the second of a three part series of autobiographies of God, Satan, and Jesus, respectively.  Be sure to complete your own collection of the trilogy with copies of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I AM WHO I AM:  AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF GOD,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I AM THE WORD:  AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JESUS.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;)" />
