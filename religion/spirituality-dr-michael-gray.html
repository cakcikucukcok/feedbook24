  <title>Spirituality - Dr Michael Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The undeniable truth for many is that their spirit is in pain. It is manifested in many ways, such as anger, grief, anxiety, depression, or a lack of hope in their future. The most immediate need is to realize there is a means to overcome the pain, and it involves having a spiritual life. This is the basis for this work&#39;s initial printing in 2012. Since the initial printing of the book&#39;s first edition, entitled Spirituality: Key to Physical and Mental Well-Being, it has become apparent to the writer that this pained spirit operates deceptively by lack of reason and purpose.  This absence of rational-based thinking and preference for emotional feelings over reasoned behaviors represents our present place. This is how our world has adapted to the luxuries and illusions of security in the present social order. The result is a lack of critical concern for the individual&#39;s (and civilized societies) survival to be assured into the future. The theoretical address to this perceptual shift is the reason for the reprint of this book with two parts. The second part addresses this issue. It is entitled The Modern Perceptual Shift: Preference for Emotional Responses as Reality.   It is important to understand that, although this book appears to be a scholarly and difficult read, it is essential to the well-being of the individual as a parent and productive member of society. In order to understand our world and our individual functioning, a read and consideration of this book is vital. To the mental health professional, this treatment provides a balanced approach to utilizing therapy to assist clients in gaining control over their world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
