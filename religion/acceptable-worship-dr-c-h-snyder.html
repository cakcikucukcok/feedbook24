  <title>Acceptable Worship - Dr. C.H. Snyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whenever worship is mentioned there seems to be an immediate vision of what worship should be. That vision is generally produced from past experiences and practices. Very seldom does anyone stop to consider the possibility that what they believe to be worship may not be worship at all in the eyes of God. For many people, worship is just another form of entertainment and self-gratification. If one is to truly worship the Lord we should consider what God says is acceptable to Him. In Genesis 4:3-7, we have Cain and Abel coming before the Lord to worship; Abels worship was accepted and Cains rejected. In verse 7 God basically tells Cain that if he did it right he would be accepted, if not sin lies at the door. The challenge for anyone who seeks to worship the Lord is to do it right!&lt;/p&gt;" />
