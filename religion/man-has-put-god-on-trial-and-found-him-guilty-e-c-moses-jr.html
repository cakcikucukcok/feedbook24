  <title>Man Has Put God on Trial and Found Him Guilty! - E. C. Moses Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most people are taught that calamities of nature are caused by God. There are businesses that exist to replace property deemed destroyed by an act of God. We feel that loved ones are taken by God through some disease or tragedy before we are ready for them to go. We learn growing up that God controls everything about our lives and we are to fear Him. We are told that if we dont straighten up and act correctly, God will punish us. But without God and His moral righteousness, how can we know what is the correct manner of conducting our lives? None of these statements made, that God is to blame, are true and there is proof that He really does love us more than we can imagine and He wants to give us every good thing that we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of Adam from grace, God the Father has been executing His plan to redeem us back to a right relationship with Him. His desire is for us to experience His pure, unending and unconditional love. The decision to take part in that love is found in our free will to make up our own minds. He honors that because He wants us to respond freely to His love. Like presenting evidence in court to defend the accused, this book determines to show His innocence of guilt.&lt;/p&gt;" />
