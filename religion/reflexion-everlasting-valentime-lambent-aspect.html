  <title>Reflexion, Everlasting Valentime - Lambent Aspect</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reflexion, Everlasting Valentine: A modest proposal was begun as one valentine to womankind.  At publication, it has been designed as the perfect gift.  From philosopher to womankind, from a husband to the wife; the hint of proposal, or a wedding gift given enduring the day; a reflection of the past or boasting in its history, the reality of love.
Especially created as one philosophical work as to obtain the universal audience, Reflexion, Everlasting Valentime: A modest proposal... had granted the virtue of peace into the life of the author.  Growing into one of the most precious breaths of life, the idea persevered to enchant the mind.
Concluded as to be one swift read, like valentine, the thought of philosophical treatise has been lighted using epic poetry.  Using strict grammar, the entire work had been completed; a book written in active tense about the helping verb.  The handwritten manuscript found light in the writing of the final work.
The author had designed to illustrate the power of English, and the use of philosophical dynamic to kindle aspiration.  What is freedom?  Where is wisdom?  The mystical aspect abirths I want reflection.  And further, to gain poetry as grammatical image.  While, to speak freely unto the face of all people unto the hundredth of year.
Freedom is to read once, desire it twice, and read it again and again.  First, she had been.  Finally, she barely appeared to be.  One thing had been gained as incomplete, such unity explores times and time once again.  Though, I do say.  Silence had both and touched each." />
