  <title>He Uttered “Soulmate” - Athena Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God works in mysterious ways. Both in love and in life, in sickness and in health, and in success and in failure, God is present in our lives, guiding us forward along his path. But do we always listen for his instructions? Do we always stay on the path? And do we always trust in him, even when the circumstances and people in our lives arent going along as we planned? 
He Uttered Soulmate tells the story of one womans journey to stay on Gods patheven as she struggles with unrequited love from her soulmate. With each revelation she has along the way, author Athena Coleman finds that these interventions are crafted especially for her, and through it all she finds that the utterances of the Holy Spirit communicate divine completeness and fullness. From her early years moving to the Mid-South, becoming a mother, and dealing with her love for Tristan, walk in Athenas shoes as a young woman matures and ultimately finds her second wind in life and in faith. 
God does not give the spirit of fear, and although the path he sets before us can seem scary or uncertain, the destination holds a happiness and fulfilment that only eternity in the Lord can provide. He Uttered Soulmate reminds us to listen for the words and guidance of the Holy Spirit, so that we too can enjoy our destinies." />
