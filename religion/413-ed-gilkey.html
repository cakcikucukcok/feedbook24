  <title>413 - Ed Gilkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are probably not two more polar opposite genres than rap music and drag racing. The author is by no means an authority on either. &lt;br /&gt;
By 2012, it was apparent that the United States was facing many problems. The laundry list included: jihadists, unemployment, health care woes, unconstitutional and unchallenged moves by government officials,... the list seems endless.&lt;br /&gt;
Yet at the core of the nation&#39;s ills was the over arching issue of right and wrong. How is it defined? And who defines it ?&lt;br /&gt;
Into this maelstrom of chaos, the characters herein find themselves cast.&lt;br /&gt;
Nearly 50 years after the radicals of the 1960&#39;s found their answers &#39;blowing in the wind&#39; , what has America become ?&lt;br /&gt;
The D&amp;J Racing team of Mountain Home, Va., find themselves ensnared in a world far beyond 1/4 mile races. One will lose life because of it.&lt;br /&gt;
And what of the children who walk through the land where selfish pleasure dominates each individual&#39;s daily life. Sarah and Micah are about to find out.&lt;br /&gt;
There are others who live outside the &#39;tranquil&#39; world of Mountain Home. They have been gifted to live in the fast lane of &#39;pop culture&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;
Wealthy, yet morally bankrupt, the FATFISTs and BARON ALLs of the world are about one thing- PLEASURE- regardless of the cost. If there money to be made at the expense of the innocence of children-so be it.&lt;br /&gt;
Then there are the Runks...an inter-city detective and his wheelchair bound wife. Discredited and dismissed by those in power, they become the embodiment of Philippians 4: 13 - &quot;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
