  <title>Chapters of the Heart: Jewish Women Sharing the Torah of Our Lives - Sue Elwell, Nancy Fuchs Kreimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chapters of the Heart: Jewish Women Sharing the Torah of Our Lives invites readers into the lives of twenty women for whom Jewish language and texts provide a lens for understanding their experiences. The authors don&#39;t just use religious words (texts, theologies, or liturgies) like a cookbook. Instead they serve readers something closer to a real meal, prepared with love and intention.  Each essay shares one piece of its writer&#39;s heart, one chapter of experience as refracted through the author&#39;s particular Jewish optic. The authors write about being daughters, mothers, sisters, partners, lovers, and friends. They share their experiences of parenting, infertility, and abortion. One describes accompanying her young husband through his life-threatening illness. Another tells of her daughter&#39;s struggle with an eating disorder. Still another reflects on long decline of a parent with Alzheimer&#39;s.   All these writers wrestle with Jewish texts while growing as rabbis, as feminists, and as interfaith leaders. They open their hearts and minds, telling when Jewish tradition has helped make meaning and, on occasion, when it has come up empty. The results are sometimes inspiring, sometimes provocative. Readers will find new insights into God, into Judaism, and into themselves." />
