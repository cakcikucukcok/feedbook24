  <title>Prince of Vodou - Heather Rae Rodin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;That night, for the first time in five years, the beautiful spirit woman came to visit, floating through the thick cement wall without making a sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had not seen her since the day he decided to follow Jesus, leaving vodou behind, and had almost forgotten about her. She appeared the same, but surrounded by darkness he had not noticed before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching his bed she knelt at his side weeping bitterly. Why are you doing this to me? she sobbed. Dont leave me, Joisaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must go and never come back, the boy spoke firmly. I belong to Jesus now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you obey me, I will make you very rich and powerful. Her breath tickled his ear and he pulled away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wanted to be rich. He wanted to be powerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Softly filtering through the darkness came the still small voice of God, reminding him he was loved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two voices battled in his head throughout the night until, in the early morning light, he lay limp and exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;" />
