  <title>A Priest in the Home - James Michael Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book is designed for the instruction and encouragement of men to be the leaders in their homes in both spiritual and physical matters. If men will fulfill their responsibilities as spiritual leaders in their homes, the world and the church would see an immediate revival of Gods Spirit. This book will show them why they should and how to begin.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 1 gives a brief history of the Old Testament priesthood and why God originally established it. Uniquely sets the stage for our New Testament priestly duties.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 2 explains the rituals followed in ordaining and consecrating the priests under the Old Covenant, and relates these to our New Covenant consecration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 3 explains what the daily sacrifice was and why it had to be performed, and relates it to our daily sacrifice today of prayer, both morning and evening.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 4 discusses Joshuas declaration of his entire households dedication in service to the Lord, and explains the importance of our making that same declaration today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 5 explains the five main offerings instituted by God - sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, grain offering and fellowship offering - and translates those into our New Testament spiritual sacrifices today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 6 describes how God is more pleased with our obedience than the sacrifices, which were set up to atone for our disobedience in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 7 shows what kind of unselfish, unconditional love God expects husbands to have for their wives with a unique tie-in to Scripture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 8 encourages men to exercise godly dominion over every circumstance in their lives by living by faith.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 9 describes the spiritual warfare Satan wages against every Christian and how men as priests in their homes can protect themselves and their families.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 10 focuses on one particular evil spirit which is the greatest threat to the priesthood in the home and the church, and shows how to identify it and pull down its stronghold.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chapter 11 explains the spiritual significance, and the power released, by standing firm in your faith in the face of every obstacle to your spiritual walk. It leaves men with the encouragement to do everything they have learned in this book and then just stand on Gods promises that He will order the steps of a righteous man.&lt;/P&gt;" />
