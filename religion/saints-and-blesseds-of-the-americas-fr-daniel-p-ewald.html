  <title>Saints and Blesseds of the Americas - Fr. Daniel P. Ewald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kirkus Discoveries book review:
Part devotional guide, part encyclopedia, Saints and Blesseds of the Americas will find a welcome
place on the shelves of a new generation of Catholics.
Ewalds tidy collection provides an exhaustive, country-by-country listing of all the Catholic saints
and blesseds of the Western world. In Catholic theology, saints serve as intercessors between humanity and
God; blessedsthose who have undergone the process of beatificationare only one step away from
becoming saints. Believers pray to either for aid in any number of life pursuits. Perhaps the most gratifying
aspect of this catalogue is the fact that it is extremely up to date. Ewald provides not only the saints and
blesseds of old but also those recently beatified and canonized. For example, he presents the Blessed
Lindalva Justo de Oliveira, martyred in 1993 and beatified by Pope Benedict XVI just last year. This is a timely reference guide at least in part
because the previous popeJohn Paul IIwas a prolific supporter of the path to sainthood. According to the Vatican, Pope John Paul II
beatified and canonized more individuals than all the popes of the past five centuries combined. Thus, Ewald fulfills an important role in
bringing his devout readership up to speed. But currentness is not the volumes only strength. Ewald paints quick but thorough sketches of his
many subjects. His brief biographies never run much more than a page or two, but he has an eye for the fine points, and his portraits are always
extremely pertinentthere are as few wasted details as there are wasted words. However, though his book serves best as a reference volume, it
also provides a surprisingly gratifying reading experience. Ewald has the skill of a storyteller, and each biography features a neat narrative arc.
A helpful compendium to the heroes of the American Catholic Church.
