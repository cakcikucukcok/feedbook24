  <title>When God Doesn&#39;t Fix It Study Guide - Laura Story</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Laura Story&amp;rsquo;s life took an unexpected turn when her husband, Martin, was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The devastating news forever changed their lives and brought Laura&amp;rsquo;s dreams of a fairy-tale life to an end. Yet her struggles to accept her new situation also brought her deeper joy and intimacy with God as she allowed him to rewrite her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this five-session curriculum, Laura examines the twists and turns that took place not only in her own life but also in the lives of many of the heroes of the faith. She reveals how God used crises in the lives of people such as Abraham, Sarah, David, and Paul to bring them closer to him and set them on the path he wanted them to take. She also shows how God used each of these individuals in spite of their flaws and brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God may not fix everything in our lives. In fact, our situation might not ever change or get better. But we can know that God will lead us to a place where&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;we are&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t Be Surprised by Trouble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best-Made Plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God Doesn&#39;t Fix It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? The Question on Replay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Better Broken&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study guide is designed for use with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;When God Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Fix It: A DVD Study&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sold separately) and includes leader helps, video discussion questions, Bible exploration questions, and personal study and reflection materials for in between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
