  <title>Out of the Miry Clay - Susan A. Millican</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My faith journey has been one that took many twists and turns as I struggled to figure out that Jesus needed to be more than just my Savior. Once I realized He had to be Lord and Ruler of my life, my passion and gifts for writing were revealed to me. I began with journaling during my devotional/quiet time. With pen and journal in hand, I would totally open myself up and pour out my heat to God. It was during this time that I began clearly hearing God speak to me and I would write in my journal the lessons He taught me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July of 2008, my husband, Billy, was diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer and many people wanted to be kept up-to-date on his condition. Thus, I began composing update e-mails that I hoped would glorify God and how He was sustaining us through this cancer journey. However, I was determined I would wait on God to give me the words He wanted me to share. So with the keyboard at my fingertips, I began sharing the lessons God was teaching us along this journey. While everyone was very grateful to hear that Billy was being healed, they were very touched by how God was working in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know that God would use the recipients of these e-mails to encourage me to see my passion for writing as a gift that God was using to call me to expand His territory. Therefore, during the summer of 2010, I finally heeded Gods call to put all my journaling skills and His lessons into composing this devotional book. I pray that God will be glorified as He uses these lessons to help you come to know Him in a deeper more intimate fashion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken Shells&lt;br&gt;
Chasing Crabs&lt;br&gt;
Lessons from The Boys&lt;br&gt;
Loving the Unlovable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Root Bound&lt;br&gt;
Score Another for God&lt;br&gt;
Candy Along the Way&lt;br&gt;
Flowers From Fertilizer&lt;br&gt;
I Want One of Those&lt;br&gt;
Covered in Feathers&lt;br&gt;
Dead Trees and Deep Roots&lt;br&gt;
Foresight&lt;br&gt;
Dance With Me&lt;br&gt;
The Birds and the Bees&lt;br&gt;
Angels and Chemo&lt;br&gt;
Gods Orchestra&lt;br&gt;
Healing in the Journey&lt;br&gt;
Seeing the Wheat&lt;br&gt;
Scarcely Abundant&lt;br&gt;
Strolling&lt;br&gt;
Cracked Pots&lt;br&gt;
Give Em More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stories reflect Susans ability to see God in both the big and the little life events. They will inspire you to seek God in both the extraordinary and ordinary events of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
