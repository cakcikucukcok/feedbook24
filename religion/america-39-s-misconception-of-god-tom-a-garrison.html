  <title>America&#39;s Misconception of God - Tom A. Garrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did Jesus command us to build giant churches or did He command us to build the kingdom? Did He ask for division because of political and denominational opinions and differences? Did Jesus command us to build wealth and prosperity?Did He command us to feed the poor? What about todays social justice, welfare, racial separation, and generational poverty?
We are surrounded by great uncertainty and division  changing trends, political shifts, and fast paced objectives consume the American culture today. Yet at the center of all this uncertaintythere lies a promise If you love me, you will keep my commands and you will remain in my love.
Americas Misconception takes us to the center of our uncertainty. It challenges us to leave our misconceptions and presuppositions of God andof the Bible behind,andcalls us to accept His wordwith an open heart and mind.
Now is the time to set aside our differences and come together. And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber The night is nearly over; the day is almost here oh come awake." />
