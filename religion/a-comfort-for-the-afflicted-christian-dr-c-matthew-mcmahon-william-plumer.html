  <title>A Comfort for the Afflicted Christian - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, William Plumer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William S. Plumer (1802-1880) was an American Presbyterian minister and theologian recognized as a Reformed leader in the church in the 19th century.  Everyone deals with affliction. The question that remains is how well, as a Christian, you deal with it to the glory of God. Sometimes you will get weary. When you get weary you sometimes need a word of instruction, a word of encouragement, a word of comfort, and a word of caution. This is where William Plumer will give you all of these in a tender and pastoral manner in this wonderful devotional work.   He applies God&#39;s word to a number of afflictions that Christians regularly deal with such as the death of a loved one, those who speak hatefully against you, spiritual warfare, times of spiritual leanness, and one which many deal with daily, poor health.   This work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions." />
