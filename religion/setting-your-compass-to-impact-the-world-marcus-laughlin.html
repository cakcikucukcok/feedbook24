  <title>Setting Your Compass to Impact the World - Marcus Laughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marcus Laughlin has done the body of Christ a great service in writing Setting Your Compass to Impact the World. Marcus writes what he lives. Using Scripture as his guide, he gives personal examples and practical insights to believers as to how they can be salt and light in the culture and community in which they live. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any believer who is serious about wanting live, on a daily basis, the faith they profess.
Dr. Jarrett Stephens, teaching pastor, Prestonwood Baptist Church
Setting Your Compass to Impact the World begins with a simple assertion that we must first know that we are loved by God. This trusting that God is love can lead us by faith to trust His plan for our life. We were created with gifts or abilities to fulfill Gods plan and not our own. Ultimately this book helps each of us discover our purpose is to glorify God by fulfilling our loving Saviors plans for our lives. Its time to reset our compass on the King and His kingdom.
