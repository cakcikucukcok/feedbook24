  <title>The Neighborhood Church: God&#39;s Vision of Success - Robert G. Moss, Craig Van Gelder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to provide a theologically sound yet easy-to-use resource, based on the image of God, that can help congregations engage relationally in their neighborhoods. Rather than using the neighborhood as a resource to help make congregations successful, The Neighborhood Church contends that God places congregations in neighborhoods to help make neighborhoods successful in accordance with God&#39;s vision. This book is intended as a resource for pastors and other church leaders who pour significant amounts of energy into their congregations but feel frustrated with the results. The problem isn&#39;t with church leaders&#39; energy or commitment. On the contrary, it&#39;s a lack of awareness as to how that energy and commitment can be channeled within God&#39;s call, mission, and movement. This book is a crucial resource for congregations having difficulty navigating the treacherous waters of what it means to be successful according to God&#39;s vision." />
