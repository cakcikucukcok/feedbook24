  <title>The Overcomers - Molly Noble Bull, Jane Myers Perrine, Ruth Scofield, Margaret Daley...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you ever try to push a one hundredpound rock up a hill with nothing but a toothpick? If you can imagine what that might be like, you have some idea how difficult it is for a child with a learning problem to read or spell ten simple words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a huge amount of energy to push a heavy rock up a hill. It takes an equal amount of mental strength for a child with dyslexia to read and spell, and at the end of either of these strenuous activities, both the rock pusher and the child are exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five published Christian authors with learning disabilities wrote this book from their own experiences. It is their hope that others will be encouraged from reading how they overcame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inspiring account of five amazing women authors who demonstrated how creativity and perceptual talents go hand-in-hand with dyslexia and ADD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald D. Davis, author of &lt;em&gt;The Gift of Dyslexia: Why Some of the Smartest People Can&#39;t Read and How They Can Learn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Gift of Learning: Proven New Methods for Correcting ADD, Math &amp; Handwriting Problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Overcomers&lt;/em&gt; is a must-read for anyone with a learning disability or knows someone who suffers from that problem. These five amazing authors have opened their hearts and shared their stories in a way that puts feet to their faith and calls their readers to do the same. Dont miss this excellent read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathi Macias, author of more than thirty books, including &lt;em&gt;Red Ink&lt;/em&gt;, the Golden Scrolls Novel of the Year and Carol Award finalist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overcomers is a finalist in the 2011 Women Of Faith Contest. It is in the top 30 out of  660 entrants.  Final contest results will be announced March 31st, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;" />
