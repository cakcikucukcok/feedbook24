  <title>Healing Begins in the Heart - Karen A. Mace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you feel that God has abandoned you?&lt;/br&gt;
Do you struggle with fear and grief? &lt;/br&gt;
Are you weighed down with doubt, anger, or depression? &lt;/br&gt;
Do you wonder if you can really trust God? &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are not alone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For eight years, author Karen A. Mace and her husband, Ross, served as missionaries in South America. Blessed with the joy of doing Gods work they brought their two daughters Miriam and Sarah with them and rejoiced in the birth of their third daughter Ileana soon after arriving in Ecuador. God tested Karen and Ross more than most of His soldiers. After the deaths of Ileana and Sarah in Ecuador, just three and twelve at the time, Karen was thrown into a crisis of faith that lasted for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She &lt;i&gt;understands&lt;/i&gt; how even the most faithful can stumble and question and reject the love of the Lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Healing Begins in the Heart&lt;/i&gt;, Karen shares how God found her in her doubt. God exposed the lies that Karen had once believed. He showed her how deception created the false lens through which she saw God. As she grew in knowledge of Gods loving care, she came to see the life transforming truth of who God really is and the freedom that is hers through all that Jesus has done. An open and honest sharing of Karens trials, tragedies, and ultimate victories, this is a story about Gods grace, His perseverance with us, and His desire for an intimate relationship with us that leads us into the good plans and purposes He has for each one of us. &lt;/p&gt;" />
