  <title>The Farmer Ways of Sowing - Connie M. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Be like the farmers and sow for a change in your life circumstances. In due
season you will reap your harvest, its time to grow in GRACE, you have
been in kindergarten for too many years. God has blessed you to care for
children but yet you are still acting as a child when it comes to honoring GOD.
Grow up and honor GOD!
Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure press down, shaken together
and running over. Stop! Stop looking at your pastor as getting your money its
a seed that you sow to honor GOD. It didnt matter much where you sow your
money when you didnt know any better. Youve tried everything and anything
that came with a convincing line telling you to sow your money into this are that
and you will win more. The instruction didnt come with a defi nite fact that you
are going to win; it guarantees a chance. Thats man traditional way of sowing
and believing.
Gods way for sowing is throughout the Bible. GODs promises are: Trust in the
Lord with all your heart and lean not on your understanding, God will direct
your path. With a path like this any person seeking for new direction cant go
wrong, with trusting GOD.
Get the rope from around your neck; during slavery days, people didnt have a
choice when the rope was place around their neck. They were tied down like
cattle, bound and sail to sea, for some; they hung from a tree. Today, you have
a choice.
Farmers believe in the process of a seed sown. A farmer can have only one seed;
plant the seed and simultaneously have faith that the one seed will reproduce after
its own kind. We should have faith like a farmer. If we can just believe that seeds
reproduce after its own kind, and believe as the farmer believes; our circumstances
will change while going through the process.
Are you planting seeds?" />
