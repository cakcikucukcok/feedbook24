  <title>God&#39;s Choice - George Weigel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Weigel&#39;s &lt;em&gt;New York Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; bestselling biography of Pope John Paul II,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Witness to Hope&lt;/em&gt;, set the standard by which all portraits of the modern papacy are now measured. With&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;God&#39;s Choice&lt;/em&gt;, he gives us an extraordinary chronicle of the rise of Pope Benedict XVI as well as an unflinching view of the Catholic Church at the dawn of a new era.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When John Paul II lapsed into illness for the last time, people flocked from all over the world to pray outside his apartment. He had become a father figure to millions in a world bereft of strong paternal examples, and those millions now felt orphaned. After more than twenty-six years of John Paul II&#39;s guidance, the Catholic Church is entering a new age, with its bedrock traditions intact but with pressing questions to address in a rapidly changing world. Beginning with the story of John Paul&#39;s final months,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;God&#39;s Choice&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;offers a remarkable inside account of the conclave that produced Benedict XVI as the next pope, drawing on George Weigel&#39;s unrivaled access to this complex event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weigel also incisively surveys the current state of the Church around the world: its thriving populations in Africa, Latin America, and parts of the post-communist world; its collapse in western Europe; its continued struggles in Asia; and the vibrancy of many aspects of Catholic life in the United States, even as the Church in America struggles to overcome its recent experience of scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on John Paul II&#39;s greatness, drawing on firsthand interviews to paint an intimate portrait of the new Pope, and boldly assessing the Church&#39;s current condition,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;God&#39;s Choice&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is an invaluable book for anyone seeking to understand the Catholic future and the larger human future the Church will help to shape.&lt;/p&gt;" />
