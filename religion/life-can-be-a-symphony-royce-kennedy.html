  <title>Life Can Be a Symphony - Royce Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The main thrust of this work in to inspire the reader to strive for success no matter what present circumstances are. The intent is to specifically highlight the life of Saul of Tarsus, a Jew, who grew up in Jerusalem and was trained in the Jews religion. He excelled above his equal, being more zealous than they and could have become the next ruler in Israel.
	However, in terms of being a role model and a shining beacon to those struggling to find the path to success and dignity, he rated very poorly. He was mad against Christians, arrested many, forced many to blaspheme, and consented to the death of many.  This work shows how he dismissed his past, embraced the future, and became the greatest of all the apostles. In essence, he recognized his past but refused to be arrested and held a prisoner by it. 
As he himself explained: This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Philippians 3: 13.
	It is evident that self-evaluation and self-motivation are extremely important if one is to chart a path forward to success. Saul of Tarsus, in our opinion, serves as a classic example of how one can erase the past, no matter how sordid and violent it was; and reach forward to pinnacles of glory and inspiration, not for ones self only, but for society at large. You alone, can make your life a symphony!
WORD COUNT: 80, 459  Chapters: 31.
