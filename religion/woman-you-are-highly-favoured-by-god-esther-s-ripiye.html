  <title>Woman, You Are Highly Favoured by God - Esther S. Ripiye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Religious belief has over the years had a great influence on the status and history of women especially in the ministry. From the earliest days of the New Testament Church and up till present, most Christians have misinterpreted the scriptures on the basis of 1 Timothy 2:11-12 which says Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent.
This passage has been used by many churches to place certain restrictions on the ministry of women. This has given rise to many debates in the church and restricted many women from fulfilling their leadership call.  It is therefore important to dispel the myths about the role of women and open our eyes to what the Bible really says concerning this.  This is not about having dominance but every Christian needs to flow in the Holy Spirit to enable their gifts and calling to bring the kingdom of God to earth.   
This book contains the study of Seventy Two Women of the Bible. It gives us the details of their lives,  roles, character, and influence. It also shows how God used them in the past and still uses us as women to advance His kingdom on earth. The knowledge of the scripture is imperative.  The book also shows how to build confidence in the word of God, releasing ourselves for the Holy Spirit to flow through us so that the knowledge of the scriptures can operate in our purpose, gifts, talents and calling in Christ. The authors writing is well documented, based on revelation of the word, her leadership role over the years and from her studies of the role of women in the bible that have span for over 3 decades. The book brings honest and scriptural truth on crucial questions regarding to leadership and teaching role of women in the church. It shows how Jesus related and affirms the role of women in the kingdom. 
This book is highly recommended for all Christians who are passionate about the true teachings of the scriptures and the roles God expects men and women to play in unity for the advancement of the kingdom." />
