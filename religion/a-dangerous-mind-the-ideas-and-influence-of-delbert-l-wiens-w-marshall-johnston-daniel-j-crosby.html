  <title>A Dangerous Mind: The Ideas and Influence of Delbert L. Wiens - W. Marshall Johnston, Daniel J. Crosby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Dangerous Mind is a celebration of the ideas and influence of Delbert L. Wiens. It contains tributes to him, essays inspired by him, and some of his unpublished works. This effort has been brought together by his students, colleagues, and friends at the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of his &quot;New Wineskins for Old Wine,&quot; which hoped to guide the Mennonite Brethren as they faced the challenges of modernity--it has proven useful for other denominations facing similar transitions. This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of Delbert&#39;s foundation of the Mennonite mission in Vietnam. In addition to celebrating his ideas and influence through our writing, we have also endeavored to capture the spirit of his work through art illustrating each section of this volume." />
