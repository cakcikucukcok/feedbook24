  <title>Praying Your Way through Luke&#39;s Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles - Mark G. Boyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prayer, the raising of the heart to God, is the heart of the Christian life. For the author of Luke&#39;s Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, prayer is the habit of being in the presence of God. One of the primary ways Jesus is characterized in Luke&#39;s Gospel is that of a pray-er. Likewise in the Acts of the Apostles, the apostles are portrayed being in God&#39;s presence.   Prayer is the topic of this book; it highlights the passages where Jesus is found praying in the Gospel and where the apostles are found praying in the Acts. From the example Jesus gives in Luke&#39;s Gospel, and from the example the apostles give in the Acts of the Apostles, the reader concludes that prayer should be a part of the life of any Christian. If Jesus himself prayed--spoke and listened to God--then how can his followers do any less?   This book can be used during the Advent-Christmas Season, the Lenten Season, the Easter Season, and at any time one wants to hone his or her praying skills. This book is especially useful during the period of post-baptismal catechesis for those in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults with its focus on spiritual growth through prayer." />
