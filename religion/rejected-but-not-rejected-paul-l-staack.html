Everyone has to face and deal with rejection. If you are rejected by someone, that person is taking an action toward you. Rejected is a verb in this setting. However, rejected is also an adjective. It is a word that describes and defines. We must never allow our lives to be defined or described by rejection. Paul L. Staack has written this book to keep you out of the garbage can of a rejected life. It is inevitable! You will be rejected in life. However, as you apply the principles in this book, rejection will never define or describe your life. You can truly be Rejected: But Not Rejected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
