  <title>My Good Women: Lessons of Love and Faith - Julie A. McMurtry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, on the journey of life, it is easy to think that we are the first to walk this path or that we are alone in our struggles. This book calls us to reflect on the lives that have touched our own. Thinking about the women God has placed in your life who are they? And what have they taught you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that when you read these stories, you will find yourself reflecting on the women who have loved you, protected you, and formed you. Like the women in the Bible, they may have made cakes when their pantries were empty, visited when you were expecting your children, wiped your tears when the sorrow was too much, or made you laugh like no one else can! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May these stories make you laugh and cryand reach out to the women whose lives are squares in the quilt of your life. May these stories fill your hearts with gratitude for the women you see every day and for the God who made us all. Theirs are the stories of faith, hope, and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
