  <title>Narratives of the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus of Nazareth - Del Mueller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a member of the group that witnessed Jesus suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension? What would have been your response as you stood in the Garden of Gethsemane when the soldiers arrived; as you observed the trials that condemned your Master; listened to the echo of nails piercing his body; watched him hang from that cross and die? Then walk with Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John to witness the empty tomb. Experience the feelings of unbelief, hope, assurance, and finally the ecstasy, the joy beyond description, as you talk with, touch, and worship your risen Lord. Finally, accept with joyful anticipation your Savior ascending into the heavens with the promise of a glorious return.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Del Mueller takes readers into the thoughts and hearts of the key witnesses to Christs last days on earth. He writes a first person account that provides readers with a unique historical perspective on the stories as they really could have happened. Narratives of the Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of Jesus of Nazareth will personalize the events that transformed the world and show readers the humanness of those who were changed because of Jesus.&lt;br&gt;" />
