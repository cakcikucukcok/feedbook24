  <title>Eternal Truth - Rear Admiral Joseph H. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We must discover the real world. All generations are struggling for truth! Truth is our heritage and gift to the next generation, so we must support education for all people. Some generations have essentially halted progress, and others are making progress only because of a few.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our world, we must proclaim religious and free speech. The concept of human liberty is more than 4,000 years old and is repeated by Christ Himself.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We must dare to read, think, speak, and write the truth. Truth is not only violated by falsehood, but also by silence. Ignorance produces the work of monsters. Ignorance is not bliss; it is oblivion. Ignorance is sin, not innocence.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is what he believes, coated by either truth or ignorance. Truth demands a basic standard of living for the masses to ensure security and freedom for their development. Man is master of his fate, but he must seek the truth. Truth is on the march, and nothing can stop it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
