This can be well understood if we use this book as the spiritual tool or a yardstick to measure what is sex by taking into account that there are two realms in the world we live inthe unseen realm, which is the spiritual realm, and the seen realm, which is physical. Everything we see in the physical world originated from the unseen realm. Everything that we do in this physical world has impact in the realm or the spirit realm." />
