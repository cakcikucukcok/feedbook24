  <title>Walking Closer with God - Dr. Elizabeth Thambiraj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walking Closer with God is talking about relationship with the Living One and Only True God; God of infinite wisdom, majesty, splendour, power and honour Who alone is able to orchestrate events around us and Who&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;hears. If something burdens our mind, it is wiser to go to God in prayer because we want someone to scale the unscalable in our lives. All thoughts which are formed in our minds can be brought in captive to Gods authority by petitioning to the Lord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we express our desires to God we are not talking about experiential/emotional/mystical/ fanatical approach but rather our hearts are drawn closer to the truth so that we as children of God are spared from the deception of end days which is today. I believe prayer, supplications, songs and staying in Gods Word is the Sovereign antidote against perplexing fear and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is very spiritually mature, knows and loves the Word of God and seeks God in prayer consistently. She is very dependable and is a woman of her word. I have seen her use wise discernment in a committee setting and bring peoples ideas together in very gracious, organized, and practical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Annan; Sr. Pastors Wife, Harvest Hills Alliance Church, Calgary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is a woman of prayer. She is also a woman of faith. Only faithful prayers distinguish committed Christians from the carnal ones. Elizabeth takes joy to be alone with the Lord in prayer as her disciple lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
