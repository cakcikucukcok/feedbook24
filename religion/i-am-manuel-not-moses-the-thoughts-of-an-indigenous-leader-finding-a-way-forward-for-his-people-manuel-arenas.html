  <title>I am Manuel... Not Moses: The Thoughts of an Indigenous Leader Finding a Way Forward for His People - Manuel Arenas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="View the world as seen by Manual, a Totonac Indian from Mexico. This trailblazer, educator, civic leader and Christian describes his relationship to the Mexican people and culture, and shares real stories from his travels. Fifteen short stories are brought to life, narrated by Manual himself, ranging from his adventures growing up on tribal Totonac land, to the building of an indigenous school, to his personal spiritual and educational journeys. These tales are informative and cautionary, filled with lessons on Christian values, community building, personal growth, education and authentic leadership. Manuel knew the best way to bring value to his people was through education and a faith in Jesus Christ. Follow Manual&#39;s travels, thoughts and stories as he takes us through his life explorations as an evangelical leader, educator and Indian. &quot;Although we were here first, we know that God put us all here together, and it is my hope that we can learn to live together in harmony and love.&quot; - Manuel Arenas" />
