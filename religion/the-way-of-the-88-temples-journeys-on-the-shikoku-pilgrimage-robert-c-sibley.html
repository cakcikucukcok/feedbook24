  <title>The Way of the 88 Temples: Journeys on the Shikoku Pilgrimage - Robert C. Sibley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Compelled to seek something more than what modern society has to offer, Robert     Sibley turned to an ancient setting for help in recovering what has been lost. The Henro Michi     is one of the oldest and most famous pilgrimage routes in Japan. It consists of a circuit of     eighty-eight temples around the perimeter of Shikoku, the smallest of Japan&#39;s four main islands.     Every henro, or pilgrim, is said to follow in the footsteps of K?b? Daishi, the ninth-century     ascetic who founded the Shingon sect of Buddhism. Over the course of two months, the author     walked this 1,400-kilometer route (roughly 870 miles), visiting the sacred sites and performing     their prescribed rituals.Although himself a gaijin, or foreigner, Sibley saw no other pilgrim on     the trail who was not Japanese. Some of the people he met became not only close companions but     also ardent teachers of the language and culture. These fellow pilgrims&#39; own stories add     to the author&#39;s narrative in unexpected and powerful ways. Sibley&#39;s descriptions of     the natural surroundings, the customs and etiquette, the temples and guesthouses will inspire     any reader who has longed to escape the confines of everyday life and to embrace the emotional,     psychological, and spiritual dimensions of a pilgrimage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
