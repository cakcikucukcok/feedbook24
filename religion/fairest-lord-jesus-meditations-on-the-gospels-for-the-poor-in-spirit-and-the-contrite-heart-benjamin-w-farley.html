  <title>Fairest Lord Jesus: Meditations on the Gospels for the Poor in Spirit and the Contrite Heart - Benjamin W. Farley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gospels portray Jesus as one who often sought solitude, whether for himself or in quietude before his Father. To do so he had to withdraw from both his disciples and others. Such moments enabled him to renew his inner strength, to find God&#39;s consolation for himself, as well as to imbue him with insight and courage for the inimitable journey that God had selected him to travel.   We too need those same personal moments with God, those quiet occasions for withdrawal and reflection. If you have ever hungered for such, Fairest Lord Jesus, filled with simple, direct, and uncomplicated meditations, will speak to you. Within its pages, you will journey with Jesus across the Gospels to his Cross, hear his voice of solace and commission, while resting with him in village after village as he pauses to mend the hearts of the contrite and the lonely and heal the broken, dispirited, and ill; and, finally, on that Morning of mornings, stand with him in that Sacred Garden of the soul, where he fills all hearts with the joy of his presence and his eternal love.  In addition, enriching the collection are numerous vignettes, drawn from Farley&#39;s years of teaching philosophy and religion courses, along with poignant stories of the passage of time." />
