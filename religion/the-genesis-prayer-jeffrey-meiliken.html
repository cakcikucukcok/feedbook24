  <title>The Genesis Prayer - Jeffrey Meiliken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A prayer that promises miracles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;This book is for anyone who wants a miracle, has ever wanted to see God&#39;s work in action, or needed proof of His existence.  It is for the doubters and believers alike.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you think nothing is out there, think again.  Whether you&#39;re an agnostic astrophysicist or a seminary priest, you will discover an ancient gift that works every time, no questions asked.  By the time you finish this book, your perception of the universe will have changed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you thought God was out there but not listening, you may discover that you have been tuning into the wrong channels.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether you want to call it the Light Force of God, the creative power of the Lord, or any other expression of omnipotent omniscience because as you&#39;ll soon discover, you have the ability to tap into it.  In fact, you&#39;ve had the ability all along.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you ever wondered if anyone was listening or if anyone cared, you&#39;ll soon see for yourself the benevolence that&#39;s been available to you and all of us since the dawn of time.  You&#39;ll learn why the ancient sages said the Light Force always gives, always listens, and always answers.  Find out how to get heard.  Find out what you&#39;ve been missing.  See an infinite stream of miracles spread out before you, guiding your every step.  As you rethink everything you&#39;ve ever known, you&#39;ll see that life is not supposed to be difficult; man isn&#39;t supposed to suffer; fate isn&#39;t some abstraction beyond our control, and your life can indeed be wonderful&quot;.-&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;From the Introduction&lt;/p&gt;" />
