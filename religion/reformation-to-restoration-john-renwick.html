  <title>Reformation to Restoration - John Renwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Death by drowning or being burned at the stake. In the days of the Reformation, many Christians suffered this horrible fate. What was their crime? Simply being baptised, immersed into Christ as believing adults. Why did they endure death? They preferred death to compromising their faith. Today we are beneficiaries of the stand they took and the spiritual heritage they passed on. Thank God that after 150 years of these killing times a more enlightened age came in. This was the age of religious discussion and discovery as men sought the truth in religion. It was not easy to go against over 1500 years of human tradition. Where was truth to be found? In that which existed from the days of the apostles, the Word of God. Their spiritual quest also blesses our lives if we are but willing to listen. A further 100 years would elapse before Restoration principles produced fruit. Again, we are blessed with the fruit of their labours. However, every generation has to decide what to believe and why. That challenge remains and it is a challenge that confronts each one of us: What are we going do about it?" />
