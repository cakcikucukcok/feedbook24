  <title>Miraculous Mountain Mover - Chuck Klingman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By definition, a disciple follows. As contemporary Christians today, most of us are sincere about proclaiming that we are disciples of Jesus Christ. Yet, in truth, and by definition, few of us really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are genuine about conforming to the Lords character, at least in part, and thats a worthy pursuit. However, for various reasons as explained in this book, very few of us today are personally carrying on with the Lords own miraculous works and ways, as directed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, our own prayers, personal ministries, and methods seldom resemble the timeless prayers, ministry, and methods of Jesus, nor do our results resemble His miraculous results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This powerful book is passionately committed to helping and encouraging every believer to follow Jesus in the miraculous ways of a mountain mover, while explaining just how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So much more than another great book on prayer and discipleship, the Miraculous Mountain Mover is an invitation into the powerful life of active faith that is intended for every believer and follower of Jesus. As Christians, we are the Body of ChristHis hands and feet, His mouthpieceand were called to do His work on the earth in our day. Pastor Chuck has a first-hand experience of this, and it is his contagious passion to help others to do the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be forewarned, this book is not for the faint of heart. As you read this book, you will be very encouraged. However, you will also be challenged to step out of the shadows of fear and doubt and into the adventurous life of faith that awaits! Enjoy!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
