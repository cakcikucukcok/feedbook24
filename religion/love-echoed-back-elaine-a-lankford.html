  <title>Love Echoed Back - Elaine A. Lankford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you struggling?
Has life become unbearably complicated?
Is it unfairly twisted?
&lt;p&gt;Dont lose hope. There is someone who knows how to make things right. God is waiting for the opportunity to revolutionize your way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cry out, He will answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Echoed Back&lt;/em&gt; was written with you in mind. Our heavenly Father, working through Jesus Christ, wants to take the fear, pain, and disappointment away. In exchange, He will replace them with love, mercy, and grace. Life changes when we surrender to His way. Allow God to fill you with His love and prepare to be amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times when faced with a defining moment in life, a person has the choice to either be defeated or to look for the deeper aspects of the silver lining. Elaine has chosen the latter. She has delved into the heart of Jesus while experiencing true heartache. She has taken the opportunity to grow and see the best aspects of our Lord, even in the hardest of situations. Jesus tells us in Scripture that if we love and obey Him, we will know the very heart of God. Elaines story allows God to reveal how much He loves her (and us) and how He has shown His heart to her. This is a wonderful journey that Elaine has allowed us to walk with her. Blessings!&lt;br /&gt;
Paula Corder; friend, mother, and Meemaw&lt;/p&gt;" />
