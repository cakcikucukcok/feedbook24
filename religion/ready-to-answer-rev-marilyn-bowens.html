  <title>Ready to Answer - Rev. Marilyn Bowens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its an abomination! 
They want to pick and choose what parts of the Bible to obey! 
God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve! 
Most same-gender-loving Christians from fundamentalist backgrounds have heard these phrases, over and over again, from their Accusers  homophobic Christians who refuse to acknowledge LGBT Christians as part of the Body of Christ. In Ready to Answer, Rev. Marilyn Bowens responds to their favorite slogans; and shares additional insights from her journey from fundamentalism to peaceful, authentic, and intimate relationship with God. 
Ready to Answer is food for the souls of LGBT Christians who are struggling to heal from the abusive theology, policies, and practices of Accuser churches. 
*  *  * 
It is critically important that all LGBT Christians have an answer for those who would dare suggest that we are not embraced by the extravagant grace of our loving God. In the much needed and long awaited book, Ready to Answer , Rev. Bowens will enable us, our families and allies to conquer the fears within and the foes without. 
Rev. Dr. Yvette Flunder 
Founder and Presiding Bishop, 
The Fellowship of Affirming Ministries 
This is a book that can save lives, sanity; can help people really entrapped. It is very disarming.
