  <title>The Many Faces of Judaism - Lemuel Baker Phd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past 10 years there has been a keen interest in Jewish Studies as it relates to Christianity and I wanted to help bring authentic information regarding Judaism to several audiences that will bring each from a near ideologue to ideologues. As I traveled I noticed some people were familiar with terms from Judaism but did not know the meaning of the terms, traditions or protocols. I hope to lay a foundation of Judaism with Christians, media professionals and those who serve politically. 
There are several compelling reasons to present Judaism to an audience that are interested in the Jewish roots of the Christian Bible. There is an apologetic perspective whereby many Christians have nagging questions about the Bible and even frustrated regarding where to find the actual answers. This book provides many of those answers. 
God requires all Christians to have understanding about Christianity and the belief system they adhere to. The answers to Judaism as it pertains to our Old and New Testament are not obvious and require a command of Judaism to include the Tanakh and the Talmud that provide answers and explanations of what the Old and New Testaments are really saying. 
Any person who reads this 179 page book will have a command of Judaism and how it relates to Christianity that is above average and will also have an authentic perspective not a romantic perspective. 
Christianity without realizing it can push Jews far from them especially Orthodox Jews because we do not understand their scheme of thinking and how esoteric their beliefs are. To connect with Jews one must understand how they think and find the wisdom regarding their beliefs and values. The book is powerful and will provide insight as to Israel and their raison d etre or the purpose that justifies a things existence. Israel was designed to be a leadership nation to the entire world and is still in birth pains with regards to this God ascribed objective. 
To give you a hint to some of the conclusions I will share this much with you. God has given every people group a purpose in relationship to the entire world to make a unique contribution. The ancient Phoenicians contributed mathematics for example that benefited the entire planet. The Greeks contributed literature that are still beloved writings of antiquity for the entire planet to enjoy. Israel is the only nation and people group given the two-fold objective to receive the law directly from God and secondly to disseminate Gods law to the entire planet. 
These laws are the only laws that could keep the planet sound and congruent to Gods system and His way of doing things. In the midst of this two-fold purpose God chose Israel to bring forth our Messiah. Only Israel was set aside to bring forth Messiah who would save the entire world. If it werent for Judaism there would be no Christianity. The Christian Old Testament is translated verbatim from the Tanakh or the Jewish Bible in a different sequence but the books are the same. 
I have given you much from the book already but there is a lot more so enjoy the book and may God answer many of your questions." />
