  <title>No Regrets - Maryann Santos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In one second, the Santos family was changed forever. Driving along a toll road in Chicago, a semi-truck plowed into the rear end of the family vehicle, instantly killing two-year-old Amanda, affectionately known as Mandy, and seriously injuring her parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when you dare to trust God in the midst of tragedy? What is the message that God gave to share through the death of Amanda? What was Mandys life supposed to show us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Regrets&lt;/i&gt; author Maryann Santos believes the answer is found not through the eyes of the world but through the heart of a child. Raising Amanda, Maryann thought she was teaching her, but the truth is that Mandy taught her about life in the most unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this tragic accident, &lt;i&gt;No Regrets&lt;/i&gt; relates the story of Gods sovereign power and mighty hand of restoration using illustrations and powerful sermons by well-known Christian leaders and teachers. The purpose of this book is to reveal biblical truths hidden in plain sight, often lost in the shuffle of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets face it. We are all going to die sooner or later. It just seems that most of us live past the age of two. It is never easy to lose someone you love, especially a child, but I hope my loss is your gain  for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
