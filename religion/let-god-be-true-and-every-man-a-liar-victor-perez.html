  <title>Let God Be True and Every Man a Liar - Victor Perez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We as the church are being looked at by the lost world as a bunch of hypocrites. We need to seriously consider this viewpoint in how we are evangelizing the lost. Currently there are 3,500 people leaving the church from all denominations daily. This is definitely not the Lords plan for the Body of Christ. Another statistic showed that from the years 2000 to 2008, 20 million people left the North American church from all denominations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew 11: 28 (NAS) reads, Come to Me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. When the Lord Jesus Christ uses the term all, He is referring to every single person on Earth. When the church uses the term all, they are referring to only those who belong to their denomination. This should not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that the Lord Jesus wants to redefine who He wants to be in each and every one of our lives, if we let Him. The question is, do we want Him to, or are we comfortable with where we are operating as different denominational churches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the world is experiencing currently is testimony that business as usual has ended for the entire church world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
