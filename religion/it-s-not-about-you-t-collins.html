  <title>It’S Not About You - T. Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its Not About You sets before evangelical Christians a threefold challenge: take stock of ones life; assess the depth of commitment to promoting oneself at Gods expense; and follow Jesus Christ completely in faithful obedience. T. Collins, an experienced teacher and international medical missionary, draws upon background as a physician and an author to diagnose the human condition of idolatry, in which individuals place themselves and their desires ahead of God and his will for their lives. The discussion emerging from this diagnostic work will draw in readers with its reasoned use of Scripture, its inclusive depictions of the human condition, and its passionate appeals for Christians to turn their lives over to Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanning three sectionsIts Not About a Lot of Things, Its Not about Your Blessings, and Making It Not About Usthe twenty-five chapters in Its Not About You offers readers a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of their lives, culminating with a call to discipleship. As the last chapter notes, Contrary to what our society would like to believe, theres only one way to follow Jesuscompletely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have found your life lacking focus and purpose, if you doubted that endlessly chasing the worlds bright and shiny trinkets was the ultimate point of living, and if you have found Jesus call to follow him beguiling you to respond, then Its Not About You will serve as your guide to replacing your own self with God at the center of your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
