  <title>The Glorious Appearing - Christine Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Glorious Appearing is about the calling of God on the believers life; overcoming adversity when all hell breaks loose around you; committing to God in our personal relationship with him; the fall and the redemption of mankind; the power of the Holy Spirit and his manifesting presence in the life of true believers in prophetic revelations, dreams, and visions; and of his coming return for his bride, the church, to set up his earthly kingdom in the new heaven and new earth in the coming kingdom. This book is also an encouragement to all believers to focus on why we are living the faithful life, what our goals are as believers, and the grace of God on a dying world. Its about the supernatural power of the blood of Jesus in defeating our powerful enemySatan, the deviland to live in anticipation of the hope of his glorious appearing, which is the expectation of all believers, to inherit eternal life and to reign with him forever and ever in the new heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was dictated by the Holy Spirit to encourage all believers to seek God earnestly in praise and worship and prayer and fasting. Worship is the key. When we seek God with all our heart, we will find him. Worship takes us into the presence of God. It is there that we experience the manifesting presence of God in signs and wonders and Spiritual revelations. When you have entered the holy of holies, He takes what is of his Spirit and releases it into your spirit. God is very, very real to me, and his Word says, They that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. This is a spirit fi lled book easy to read, and full of the powerful works of the Holy Spirit in dreams and vision, revelations and spiritual manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
