  <title>Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ (Revised Edition) - John Piper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who is Jesus Christ?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve never met him in person, and you don&#39;t know anyone who has. But there is a way to know who he is. How? Jesus Christ-the divine Person revealed in the Bible-has a unique excellence and a spiritual beauty that speaks directly to our souls and says, &quot;Yes, this is truth.&quot; It&#39;s like seeing the sun and knowing that it is light, or tasting honey and knowing that it is sweet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The depth and complexity of Jesus shatter our simple mental frameworks. He baffled proud scribes with his wisdom but was understood and loved by children. He calmed a raging storm with a word but would not get himself down from the cross.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at the Jesus of the Bible. Keep your eyes open, and fill them with the portrait of Jesus in God&#39;s Word. Jesus said, &quot;If anyone&#39;s will is to do God&#39;s will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.&quot; Ask God for the grace to do his will, and you will see the truth of his Son.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Piper has written this book in the hope that all will see Jesus for who he really is and will come to enjoy him above all else.&lt;/p&gt;" />
