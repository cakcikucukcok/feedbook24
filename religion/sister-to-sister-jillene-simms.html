  <title>Sister to Sister - Jillene Simms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When John and Jill Simms relocated from North Carolina to Nevada, they were looking forward to the desert. They thought the dry desert air would improve Johns health and be an enormous relief from North Carolina in the winter. The health issues that hit Jill soon after the move would take their faith in God to higher levels than they had ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill writes with a clear and simple style that is down-to-earth and unpretentious. From the very start of her story you will feel as if you are on the journey with her. This book will be a blessing to you even if you have never had a run-in with cancer because Jills account is about looking for Gods blessings in the midst of any struggle in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jim Rauch Escondido, CA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill shares her story of surviving breast cancer, providing an example of a woman who is strengthened by her faith in Jesus Christ. The daily trials and challenges that bring emotions many will find familiar are addressed with Scripture offering support, direction, and comfort for the reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine Hay, RN Tuscaloosa, AL &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill writes with clarity, honesty, and a heart for those of you who must face a cancer diagnosis. Take and read! You will be both informed, and blessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Carla Williams Tucson, AZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical references in the devotional section are pertinent for the readers personal journey of faith alongside the prayers of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Vernon Broomfield-Payne United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;" />
