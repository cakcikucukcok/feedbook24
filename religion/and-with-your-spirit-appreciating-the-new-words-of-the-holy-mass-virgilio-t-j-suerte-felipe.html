  <title>And with Your Spirit Appreciating the New Words of the Holy Mass - Virgilio T.J. Suerte Felipe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Catholics of the English-speaking world have had to relearn the responses at Mass and retune their ears to the prayers the priest says on their behalf. The results have been frustrating, fascinating, and rewarding.
But how do we make new words our words? The former translation, in use for decades, had become a part of us. Is there anything else we can do besides wait for the new words to take root?
Yes. You can read Virgilio T. J. Suerte Felipes book, Appreciating the New Words of the Holy Mass in the Year of Faith.
Virgilio takes the reader through the principal changes to the words that stay the same from week to week, the structure known as the Order of Mass. His in-depth commentary never leaves the reader behind. He sheds light on new phrases, enthusiastically uncovering the riches of the Catholic liturgy.
Readers will come away with a greater appreciation for the richness of their Catholic heritage, the community they form when they worship, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which transcends every language.
