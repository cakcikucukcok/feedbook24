  <title>A Journey to Hope - Liz Gentry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;That God created us to be in a relationship is fundamental to the Christian faith. The relationship that Abraham and Sarah formed with God stands out as unique for two reasons: beginning in Genesis 12, God called them to follow, and they listened; therefore, they did not just hear God, but they also followed and obeyed God. In their quest of their relationship with God, Gods very being and personality are captured. Their relationship was not one of equals, but it was a relationship of trust and care. The documentation of their own difficult yet blessed journey helps us understand that relationships are journeys that may be arduous but rewarding. We can thank Abraham and Sarah for having the faith, courage, and stamina to keep seeking God, who had plans for themand has plans for us. For too long in our Christian history, we have made God distant, unyielding, and as a result, we have not seen God as close and personal. God is not distant; instead God is involved and passionate. Through Gods relationship with Abraham and Sarah Gods desire for a closeness and involvement are evident. God also encourages and invites mutual influence. We pray to be influenced by God, to be close to God, but dont we want to also influence God? I know I do! God was as committed to Abraham and Sarah as to us. God guides us as God guided Abraham and Sarah through good times and through bad times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
