  <title>From the Heart of a Child - Florence B. Kinney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Witness how God ignited the hearts of an ordinary couple and sent them on an incredible journey. Led by His light and love, the hearts of over fifty-four thousand ill, needy, orphaned, and troubled children were touched by the Masters hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you experienced a miracle?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Has your incredible journey begun?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you attached to the vine?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you created your ripple of hope?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham Kuyper, theologian and prime minister of the Netherlands in the 1800s, expressed, &quot;There is not one square inch of the entire creation about which Jesus Christ does not cry out, This is mine! This belongs to me! God continually recreates the universe through acts of grace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One husband-and-wife team has tossed many garlands of grace into the hallowed hospital halls of sick and needy children. Their story compels us to discover our own journey into the impossible as we listen for His whispers. Now! Go, and I will show you the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Gibson, MSCC, pastor, Congregational Care UMC, Webster, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same God who multiplied the loaves and the fishes called an ordinary couple to reach out to ill and needy children with two toy trucks and the love in their hearts. Through them, God built a ministry that has served fifty-four thousand youngsters in a span of twenty-three years. This is the immeasurable greatness of our God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Maier, lay leader, Union Hill UMC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. (Matthew 25:40)&lt;/p&gt;" />
