  <title>Gps from Above - Sherrill Eugene Stepter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;GPS from Above is about enabling Gods powerful Spirit (GPS) through a careful study of the fruit of the Spirit found in Galatians 5:2223. God has a plan for each of us, with promises of help and guidance. This book is filled with scripture, quotes, and statements that address each fruit uniquely. We may be on a temporary earthly journey while on our eternal Spiritual journey, but GPS from Above will help us soar toward heaven anytime, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you know my friend Eugene, you will recognize his heart and character in this work. His allegiance to Jesus is evident to everyone who knows him. And that deep loyalty is revealed in every thought, every word, and every chapter in this work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont know how long Eugene and I have been brothers. But I know that, for thirty years, he has been a source of encouragement, grace, and has a deeper commitment to Jesus for me. When Eugene writes that Jesus is his GPS that is more than a simple metaphor; it is the truth of his life. And it is the source of his amazing development into the man who lives beholding the glory of the Lord and being changed into his likeness (2 Corinthians 3:18 RSV).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I am glad Eugene has written down his thoughts in this manuscript. And I encourage you to follow his words and his heart into the very presence of Jesus (Howard Bryan, preaching minister, Westside Church of Christ, El Paso, Texas).&lt;/p&gt;" />
