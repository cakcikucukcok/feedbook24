  <title>Mindfulness For Beginners: Mindfulness Exercises - Brittany Samons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mindfulness is the mental or psychological state and ability to focus the attention or get complete and total awareness on something of the present. It is defined as a state or being completely attentive on the present moment and present circumstances as well as really paying attention to something in a conscious manner. Mindfulness is also known as total awareness and recollection which leads to the retention of the reality of things displayed at the moment rather than on what has been and what is to come. It is often called as presence of mind and the opposite of absent-mindedness. Mindfulness is a very popular term for Buddhists who follow Buddha&#39;s teachings since it is one of the core teachings of Buddha considered to be the path that will take a person to enlightenment." />
