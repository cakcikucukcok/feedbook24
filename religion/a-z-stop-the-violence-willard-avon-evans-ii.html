  <title>A–Z Stop the Violence - Willard Avon Evans Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Before deciding to actually write it, I had to ask myself many times one simple question. That question was Why am I seeing violence everywhere I look?
I took a few days to really pay attention to every act of violence that I saw with my own eyes, and in just two days of paying attention while going about my daily life, I saw thirty-eight acts of violence! I know that sounds a bit much, but thirty-eight acts in forty-eight hours is a reminder to me that something needs to be done. 
I am in prison, so its a violent place. Only nine acts actually took place between people who are incarcerated with me. The rest I saw on our ever faithful television set. I believe that many of the things we see or our children see may just have a negative effect on us as people. Children often do things that they see others do. If a child is constantly seeing someone shoot another person on TV, then I believe that child is more likely to use a gun in his or her life. Where does it stop?
This book is my personal attempt to stop the violence, which has become a worldwide epidemic. I pray that anyone who reads this book will make a decision to say no to violence and learn that it is never the answer because, in the end, we will have to answer to the Creator for all our good and bad deeds. When the violence stops, the healing can begin for us all." />
