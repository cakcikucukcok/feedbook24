  <title>Awaken Me - Patti Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Encouraging and powerful, Awaken Me offers a uniquely written, 365-day devotional journal that can help remind you of the importance of staying focused on God. Because it is undated, you can start this journal at any time of the year. Each page includes a daily prayer guide, an assortment of wonderful and gripping phrases from the Old and New Testaments, a suggested Bible reading, and a daily workbook format for your thoughts and prayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cast aside the worlds values and let God become the major influence in your life. Perfect for teenagers and adults, this devotional prayer journal seeks to help you transform into the person God designed you to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Awaken Me will help give focus and direction to both of our prayer lives, stirring Gods Word into the mix in an inspiring way.  Donna and Roger Vann, Family Life, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is the heartbeat of the Christians life. Its impossible to have a growing relationship with God while having a weak prayer life. I would encourage anyone that wants to be used by God to invest in their prayer life. Awaken Me: A Devotional Prayer Journal is a great tool to help you tune-in to God and make a difference in your world.
