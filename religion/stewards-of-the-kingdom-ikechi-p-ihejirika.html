  <title>Stewards of the Kingdom - Ikechi P. Ihejirika</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;First-century followers of Christ (representatives of the Kingdom of God on earth) lived in accordance with what they preached. Many laid down their lives rather than compromise Kingdom values. For them, the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was more than words; it was about imitating Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is utter confusion in the twenty-first century Christian world because unfaithful stewards over the centuries added to the gospel of Christ. Their creation--a new Christianity (&quot;Religious Christianity&quot;)--commingled Kingdom and worldly values, shut out the Holy Spirit from His Church, and undermined Christ&#39;s teachings. The result: many Christians cannot differentiate the wheat from the chaff, the truth from the lie, the gospel of Christ from the false gospels, biblical churches from syncretistic churches, good stewards from bad stewards, and Kingdom values from worldly values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewards of the Kingdom takes away the grey, brings clarity, exposes centuries&#39; old conspiracies and lies, and calls on followers of Christ (Kingdom representatives) to rise up and take back their stolen Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
