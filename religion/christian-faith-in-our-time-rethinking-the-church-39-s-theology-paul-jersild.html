  <title>Christian Faith in Our Time: Rethinking the Church&#39;s Theology - Paul Jersild</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jersild responds to a fundamental issue in the theology of the church: what is the nature of our language in addressing the mysteries of our faith, such as speaking of God, or of the incarnation? Advocating a &quot;modest&quot; theology in facing the mystery of God, and acknowledging the impact of postmodern sensibilities, he lifts up the metaphorical language of Jesus as the key to a responsible theology. Jersild makes his case for a &quot;faith-based imagination&quot; centering on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as God&#39;s man who brings a divine, redemptive love to the human story. Theology does not give us a line in the sand that divides the saved from the lost, nor is it the truth that makes all other religions false. This is a book for seekers as well as many church members who harbor questions and doubts about the church&#39;s theology." />
