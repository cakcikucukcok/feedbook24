  <title>Refreshing Rain - Frances Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written in relation to several prophetic words I received from my Heavenly Father. Indeed, I was commissioned by him to write a book concerning my calling, my godly mission, and the difficult journey I have experienced along the way. 
Therefore, to those whose hands this book comes into, it is my sincere desire that you will see the goodness of God and not my wisdom or talent. In truth, I give you Christ, the one who has filled me with the hope of his glory.
Without a doubt, Gods amazing grace is truly like refreshing rain. For only through him I have endured the many trials and persecutions. He has brought me safely through the intended hurt and harm of many of my adversaries and has established my going.
Now I feel truly blessed. In fact, I am in the dawning of a new day. Through Gods steadfast love, I can truly say that weeping might endure for a night but joy comes in the morning.
As I tell my story, I have decided to begin each chapter with an inspirational poem. I hope you will find great enjoyment in your reading." />
