  <title>Power to Become Sons of God - Oluseye Oluwatayo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Power to Become Sons of God is a book that is written to help believers understand the essence of their salvation in Christ Jesus. It is an eye opener especially to young believers, to believe their faith in whom they have accepted as their Lord and Savior. 
In these days, the Word of God is being watered down by many who are expected to teach the undiluted Word of God. These are the days described in the Bible that there would be famine of bread, which is the Word of God. 
We need to go back to the basis of our salvation in order to be what God has called us to be, not what your parents, friends, or society want you to be. It is obvious you cannot do that if you do not know the purpose of your salvation. 
Many today want to be like their pastors, or so called mentors. Christ is our standard in all things, not men. This book would help you in setting your priorities." />
