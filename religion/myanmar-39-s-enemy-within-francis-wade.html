  <title>Myanmar&#39;s Enemy Within - Francis Wade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For decades Myanmar has been portrayed as a case of good
citizen versus bad regime – men in jackboots maintaining a suffocating rule
over a majority Buddhist population beholden to the ideals of non-violence and tolerance.
But in recent years this narrative has been upended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2012, violence between Buddhists and Muslims erupted
in western Myanmar, pointing to a growing divide between religious communities
that before had received little attention from the outside world. Attacks on
Muslims soon spread across the country, leaving hundreds dead, entire
neighbourhoods turned to rubble, and tens of thousands of Muslims confined to
internment camps. This violence, breaking out amid the passage to democracy,
was spurred on by monks, pro-democracy activists and even politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this gripping and deeply reported account, Francis Wade
explores how the manipulation of identities by an anxious ruling elite has laid
the foundations for mass violence, and how, in Myanmar’s case, some of the most
respected and articulate voices for democracy have turned on the Muslim
population at a time when the majority of citizens are beginning to experience
freedoms unseen for half a century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
