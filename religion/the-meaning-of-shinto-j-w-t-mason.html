  <title>The Meaning of Shinto - J.W.T Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="J.W.T. Mason presents rare insight not only into the basic beliefs of Shinto, but also into the importance of mythology and creativity to the evolution of our understanding of life and the universe. Mason begins by establishing his view of the development of man, language, and spiritual expression. Early man had an innate, intuitive understanding of the universe. This understanding was expressed through mythology and ritual.
&lt;br&gt;Shinto&#39;s traditions and practices still reflect this ancient understanding that all things, living and non-living are of divine spirit. Man is an integral part of Great Nature, Dai Shizen. In Shinto, man seeks to re-establish the natural harmony, to return to the path and rhythm of Great Nature, through prayer, ritual, and daily routines.
&lt;br&gt;Mason explains the vitality of Shinto in today&#39;s modern world. In this valuable work, the reader will find not only an insightful explanation of Shinto beliefs and ritual, but also a challenge to individuals of any spiritual tradition that their religious experience remain rooted in ancient, intuitive wisdom while simultaneously developing conscious understanding and contemporary expression." />
