  <title>A Model of Christian Charity - John Winthrop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;A Model of Christian Charity&amp;quot; is a sermon by Puritan leader John Winthrop, delivered on board the ship Arbella on April 8, 1630 while en route to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, although it might have been preached at the Holyrood Church in Southampton before the colonists embarked in the Winthrop Fleet. It is also known as &amp;quot;City upon a Hill&amp;quot; and denotes the notion of American exceptionalism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The sermon was known by reputation and preserved in contemporaneous manuscript copy held by the New-York Historical Society, but it was not published until the 1830s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;John Winthrop&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;(12 January 1588 &amp;ndash; 26 March 1649) was an English&amp;nbsp;Puritan&amp;nbsp;lawyer and one of the leading figures in founding the&amp;nbsp;Massachusetts Bay Colony, the second major settlement in&amp;nbsp;New England, following&amp;nbsp;Plymouth Colony. Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony&amp;#39;s first 20 years. His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan &amp;quot;city upon a hill&amp;quot; dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies." />
