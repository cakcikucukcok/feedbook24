  <title>Headship Intercessions and Examples of How Head Issues Such as Exemption from Judgement of Political Leaders - Peter Hakutizwi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Migration, inflation, and economic embarrassments highlighted by epidemicssuch as HIV, tuberculosis, cancer, and virusesare just a reflection of a household to national framing of laws that rule the governed. The portrait is determined by the lawgiver and allowed to circulate through the governors treasuries and cashiers. The author as a writer traces his handwriting for both late and early intervention for political and ecclesiastical structuring. He employs ecclesiastics to bless and interpret laws governing a family to national level then the adaption of it globally. Laymans terms are for summarized version of what an intercessor has in mind, which is first the clergyman called Levite then the nonresident, the protection of the fatherless and to advocate widows in quickness. Not everyone can see the law as protection as how its author is with the blueprint for solutions, and such are known as prayers that divine beings enforce on the day of approval and penning. Not everyone is an author or intercessor to establish household laws, be it for wage floors, entrepreneurship environment, or appointment to office qualifications and functionalities. The Ecclesiastics are ordained of divine law through divinity approvals to both reward and punish a household and nation.
The class of cashiering, treasuring, and governing allows the circulation of what the author writes as law to masses of people. This makes the banking world more prominent and, secondly, the educators followed by enforcers such as the police. A note issued by the bank as a bank note is prevalent because of the force behind it, so all this writing is to show how economics from divinity can be stewarded." />
