  <title>The Earth and the Sons of Men - Kenneth A. Faminu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book The Earth and the Sons of Men is lucid and laconic, very easy to read
and to understand. It is full of intrigues, suspense, and character manipulation.
It is really a religious fiction of the highest order.
The author carefully arranges and perfectly rearranges it as to appear
mysterious. In the beginning, the creatures of the Creator like the Earth, the
Sky, the Moon, the Stars, the Ocean, the Sea, the Day, and the Night are
personified as if they are beings. Mother Earth accuses the sons of men of so
many vices ranging from warmongering to rumormongering, adultery, idolatry,
rape, assassination, jealousy, and arrogance. She therefore warns them and
promises that if they (sons of men) fail to desist from these acts of wickedness,
she would report them to their Creator.
The sons of men turned deaf ears to Mother Earths advice and committed
injustice to humanity and other creatures like the Ocean, Sea, Day, Night, Stars,
and Rivers.
The only creature the son of man could not mess with is the Sun because of
its distance and ferocity. Hence, Mother Earth called other creatures and briefs
them on the atrocities sons of men are perpetuating on her (Earth).
The authors personification of these creatures makes the whole scenario
so fearful when you read and picture the catalogue of sons of mens wickedness
enumerated by the Earth.
Mother Earth carefully informed the creatures that the sons of men are
so arrogant and incorrigible that they refuse to agree that they are evil and are
perpetuating evil; she therefore begged and urged these creatures to join her to
report these arrogant sons of men to their Creator. She seriously implored them
to be her witnesses before their Creator (God). These creatures agreed to be
Mother Earths witnesses because they confess the sons of men have committed
so many atrocities not only to Mother Earth, but also to Ocean, Sky, Sea, Rivers,
Night, Day, and even the Moon.
The systematic religious arrangement and relevant biblical quotations to back
the accusations against sons of men show the deep knowledge of the scripture
by the author. Mother Earth requests an appointment with God through Jesus
Christ in order to present her case. The author deeply involves Jesus Christ as
an authentic witness of Mother Earth during the crucial meeting with God,
the Creator. Mother Earth, the Ocean, Sea, the Sky, the Day, the Night, the
Stars, the Rivers, and the sons of men met with God on the appointed day and
at the appointed place to present their cases.
The Creator listens very well; he apportions blame to the sons of men and
congratulates Mother Earth. The author gradually ameliorates the tension of
sharp and logical argument between sons of men and Mother Earth so that the
reader could catch his or her breath to be able to see the facts, the reasoning,
and the lessons in the book by allowing God to intervene as his final judgment.
While God accepts that he created sons of men to be the rulers of all things on
Mother Earth, he disapproves the acts of wickedness, arrogance, belligerence,
and immorality of sons of men.
The Creators philosophical conclusion makes me shudder and tremble
when he pacified Mother Earth and said, My spirit will not be with the sons
of men because of their wickedness, you may wish to know that the sons of men
are mere dust, they are taken out from you and to you they will return.
The lessons to be learned from this book are many: that men should be free
from every kind of wickedness, evil greed, depravity, envy, civil strife, deceit,
malice, gossip, slander, God hating, insolence, arrogance, and boasting.
How memorable will it be according to the wish of the author if some of
our young actors and actresses could come together to make a film out of this
bookusing voice-over on the creation.
