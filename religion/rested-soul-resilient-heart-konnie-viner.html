  <title>Rested Soul, Resilient Heart - Konnie Viner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gods faithfulness seems elusive when abuse and betrayal cause devastating emotional storms of brokenness. Victims experience deep soul wounds of rejection, humiliation, shame, and loss from ones who vowed to honor them. Statistics are alarming: one in three women will experience domestic abuse in her lifetime, and one in two women will experience betrayal or divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been said that it takes years to build trust and seconds to break it. If you have experienced the wounds of abuse or betrayal, you know that to be painfully true. The deepest wounds come from the closest relationships. Adultery and abuse break the covenant of love, trust, and honor. There will be difficult decisions ahead, but Jesus is the true anchor that holds securely in every storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 1, Devastated, you will begin to assess the damage caused by your storm of brokenness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 2, Deceived, you can allow Gods truth to help you abandon the lies of your abuser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 3, Distressed, you can find courage to address your fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 4, Defined, you will learn to appropriate Gods promises for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 5, Drawn, you will affirm your worth as a child of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 6, Determined, you can accept Gods plan for your future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 7, Derailed, you will learn how to avoid traps intended to sidetrack you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In Week 8, Devoted, you will learn how to abide daily in the presence of God, the one who loves you unconditionally and will never fail you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can rely on Gods promised faithfulness, which is the key that unlocks hope in the darkest emotional storms. A journey, which began in brokenness, can end in renewed trust as God faithfully provides rest for your weary soul and strength for your broken heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
