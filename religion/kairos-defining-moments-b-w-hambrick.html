  <title>Kairos Defining Moments - B.W. Hambrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Have you ever had a moment when everything seems to change? What makes that momentary but long-lasting difference? God shows up to participate in our lives and performs a miracle, speaks words of peace, gives new direction, or whatever else the Creator of the universe chooses to do. But in those defining moments, virtually everything changes; the impossible becomes possible. Why? Because God is God, and He still rules His universe. The God who created all things can accomplish more in His defining moment than we can accomplish in a lifetime. After all, according to Genesis, He created the heavens and earth, including man, in just six days and rested on the seventh. From that truth, one would draw an obvious conclusion that what we do is not going to impress God; but when He acts in our behalf, it will always astound us. We serve an awesome God! Those times are kairos moments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For twenty-five years, Pastor B.W. Hambrick has pastored the people of the Ephrata Church of the Nazarene, Ephrata, Pennsylvania. Changed lives, culture change, renovations, new buildings, even relocation have all been part of the ongoing movement of the church. There have been many events that have defined the church and Pastor Hambricks ministry, but nothing has defined it quite like those unique moments, those kairos moments, when everything changed for the better. Nothing, absolutely nothing, can explain the stories shared here, except the immediate intervention of God. &lt;/p&gt;" />
