  <title>Chosen: a Study in the Doctrine of Election - Chet Cataldo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Has God decided everything beforehand, in ages past? Or are the choices and decisions made by you and I real choices? The doctrine of election has split the Christian Church. Denominations and congregations have been formed over agreement or disagreement with how election is interpreted. There have been numerous Christian families that have seen members take opposing sides over this teaching. In addition, this doctrine has caused the hearts of many sincere Christians to tremble, fear and at times even give up. Election, to be chosen is a teaching that is taught throughout the Bible. However, the interpretation of election found within many churches misses the meaning that is taught in the Word of God. Election does not mean that God has pre-determined the destiny of a certain few. The primary meaning of election means to belong to God. The present study is an attempt to explain the Biblical teaching of election." />
