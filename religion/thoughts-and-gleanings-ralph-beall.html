  <title>Thoughts and Gleanings - Ralph Beall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this volume are the Bible answers to many of the questions some may have about some of the teachings in the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Gods desire and purpose in creation? &lt;br /&gt;What is the gift of God the Father? Of God the Son? Of God the Holy Spirit? &lt;br /&gt;What is the relationship of God, Satan, and man to one another? &lt;br /&gt;Who is God the Holy Spirit, and what is his work? &lt;br /&gt;Was Satan created? &lt;br /&gt;Will mans soul/spirit exist forevermore? &lt;br /&gt;What is the origin, the purpose, and the destiny of man? &lt;br /&gt;What is sin? What is death, physical and spiritual?&lt;br /&gt;Who is the source of all lies and all evil, wickedness, and sin? &lt;br /&gt;Who is the source of all truth, logic, reason, and all that is good, righteous, and wise? &lt;br /&gt;What is the cause of all sorrow, suffering, pain, sickness, and death? &lt;br /&gt;Whose sins are washed away? &lt;br /&gt;Can one be pleasing to God and be a soldier, a policeman? &lt;br /&gt;Does God desire/approve of any person enslaving another? &lt;br /&gt;Is man under any law from God today? &lt;br /&gt;Is man shaped by nurture or nature? &lt;br /&gt;What must one do to be saved, have his sins forgiven, and live forevermore in heaven with the godhead three? &lt;br /&gt;What is the power of God that can save the soul to live forevermore in heaven? &lt;br /&gt;What are the things which must shortly come to pass for the time is at hand and revealed by signs to the Apostle John by Jesus Christ? (Revelation 1:13)&lt;/p&gt;" />
