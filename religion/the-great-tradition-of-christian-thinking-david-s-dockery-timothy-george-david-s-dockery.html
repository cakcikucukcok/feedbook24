  <title>The Great Tradition of Christian Thinking - David S. Dockery, Timothy George, David S. Dockery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A college education becomes truly meaningful when faith affects what happens in the classroom every day. According to David Dockery and Timothy George, it&amp;rsquo;s only by stepping into the great tradition of Christian thinking that students can take hold of the true power of their education. They demonstrate that vibrant, world-changing Christianity is not anti-intellectual; instead, it assumes a long tradition of vigorous Christian thinking and a commitment to the integration of faith and scholarship as essential to the preparation of a next generation of leaders in the church, the academy, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first volume in a new series, this book introduces an approach to the Christian tradition that is not simply historical overview, but will also help students engage with contemporary challenges to their faith in various academic fields. This reader-friendly guidebook shows how to address those challenges by reclaiming the best of the Christian intellectual tradition. With illustrations, reflection questions, and a list of resources for further study, this book is sure to be a timely tool in the hands of believing students in both Christian and secular universities. Part of the Reclaiming the Christian Intellectual Tradition series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
