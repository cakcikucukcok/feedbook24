  <title>Theories  of  Inerrancy and Inspiration  of  Biblical Scriptures - Dr. Quinton B. Richmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written to help all born-again  Christians to believe that Eternal  Life begins in our present life on earth and continue on into the World of Eternity. It is designed  to impress on the minds of all humankind  that those who are considered  their enemies,  will respond and repay them in kindness as a friend.
Accordingly,  the chosen subject, The Road to Eternal Life, was selected  in order to broaden my knowledge  and understanding of Christian  believer&#39;s concepts  as to why Eternal Life can be lived in our present day journey  on earth, and it is a viable truth in God&#39;s plan of salvation.  Also, this research is devoted to find out what concepts theories, and beliefs already  exist in this area. In addition, my goal was to read and understand  the history why Jesus Christ&#39;s teachings&#39; are the Way, the Truth, and Everlasting Life for all who repent of sins and believe  His Gospel. In addition, my purpose is with the intent to gain a new perspective  and pursue efforts to add new thoughts and ideas and to strengthen  prior ones in relation to the Kingdom  of God which
concerns the future and the End of Time.  Furthermore, to pursue efforts in detailed reviews of other book data that contain ideas, concepts,  and key theories of biblical  opinions  of God&#39;s Eternal Life Plan... Then analyze and evaluate these sources information and evidence  used in their conclusion.
Likewise, consider the values of other source ideas, theories, concepts, practices that are useful in today&#39;s religious  culture.    Similarly, there is the desire to pursue creative
innovations efforts which set forth new theories  never before revealed  on the subject of Eternal
Life. In addition, my efforts are directed to provide accepted meaning,  and strength,  and theories that already exist. Likewise,  the primary design of this research is: (1). to determine  what claims are made by major sources  in traditional  work, (2). to determine  if these prior sources  actually report viable data, and evaluate and assess the validity of their arguments  given for rejection/acceptance of Eternal Life, (3). to determine what ideas, theories, and practices  are based on inductive  and deductive  practices." />
