  <title>Common Sense Apologetics - Dave Abell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While atheists and religious liberals purport themselves to be
enlightened intellectuals, what we find, upon deeper exploration,
is that their intellectualism is simply a facade. Conversely, many
believers are unable to defend their faith and shrink back when
confronted with tough questions, particularly those concerning
Jesus being the only way to Heaven. Whether out of fear, lack of
knowledge, or a spirit of compromise, the ability to express the
idea of one true Holy Book, and one true way to Heaven, seems
to escape far too many Christians. Common Sense Apologetics
will inspire Christians to drop this spirit of timidity, while
gaining confidence and loving boldness when sharing the faith.
Foundational, is the fact that God has not called Christians to
believe what is not believable nor defend what is indefensible.
The evidence for Gods existence and the truth of His Word is
abundant and accessible. Christians have Biblical directives
to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and lovingly contend for
the faith when it is perverted from within and attacked from
without. This book is uniquely constructed to present a practical
approach to learning why the Christian faith is true, and a better
method for defending that truth." />
