  <title>Bringing Church to the Elderly - James E. McNamara, Lori McNamara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As our aging population increasingly moves into out of home situations, there is a need to bring the church and its message of hope and faith to seniors in assisted living centers and nursing homes who otherwise are not able to attend services. Two of the leading advocates for this important service share an inspiring message and guidelines to both clergy and lay people who may never have thought of being a part of this heartfelt movement. The book walks the reader through the stages of choosing a location, recruiting volunteers, selecting a service format, and deciding on the necessary equipment and supplies that you will need. It discusses some of the special needs of the elderly and how to best provide for those needs. Sermon topics and music selections are also a very critical part of the service that are covered." />
