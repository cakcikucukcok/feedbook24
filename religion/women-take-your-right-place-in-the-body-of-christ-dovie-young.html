  <title>Women, Take Your Right Place in the Body of Christ! - Dovie Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is for women who have been seeking the Lord for their place in the body of Christ. Much has been said against the calling of women. This book will help women to be freed from what they have heard for many generations about women not being leaders in the church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus equipped His church, giving gifts to men and women. God wants to use yielded, bold vessels in these last days, and women should know that they are included in this higher level of supernatural power; however, they have been bound to what has been said from the Scriptures in what Paul was addressing. It is incumbent on us to search the Scriptures through the power of the Holy Spirit so that He can harmonize for us the full knowledge of His word. This book will help you pull your callings and anointings off the shelf and begin to move forward in faith for what God has for you. Women! Take your place in the body of Christ!&lt;/p&gt;" />
