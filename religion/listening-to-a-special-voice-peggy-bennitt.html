  <title>Listening to a Special Voice - Peggy Bennitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about my husband, Harry, and myself two people who had a strong desire to help others and to inspire someone to do what we did. When starting a work camp for the first time, we did not realize that God would call us to one after another. I wanted to be able to help those who lived with a feeling of not belonging. This all came true for me when we were with Russian children who lived in a government program that combined their school and their home. The children were
either orphans or abused. One day, a young girl came to me and said, I can tell by your eyes you understand how we feel.
I knew then Harry and I were doing what our Lord was telling us to do." />
