  <title>Let&#39;s Do Life - David Conellias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains practical principles that serve to empower, motivate, inform, and encourage the reader. It requires the reader to keep an open mind because of the nature of the dynamic content. The book touches on a range of topics which include the following: 
	The power of the mind and words: How our thoughts and the words that we speak help frame our world, either negatively or positively.
	Health and beauty: Benefits of eating healthy, exercise, and rest. When it comes to beauty, how different oils help look after and nourish your skin.
	Management skills: Practical ways of applying management skills such as time management, finance management, and resource management.
	Etiquette and communication skills: Etiquette is an art that seems to be drifting away in society today. People seem to be losing basic morals like being polite and courteous. This book touches on these very basic principles that help people coexist harmoniously. It also touches on how to improve your communication by watching your body language and being clear in your intentions.
	Authenticity: God made everyone elaborately unique for a reason. Arise an authentic person, reveal and express the glory deposited within by learning to become all that you were designed to be. It takes some effort to dig out diamonds, but the process is worth it in the end.
	Spiritual matters: An encouragement for the believer to pray, have faith, love, forgive, and keep Jesus at the centre of it all.
The book is for the one who simply wants to learn and discover the beauty of just living life in abundance!" />
