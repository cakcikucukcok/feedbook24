  <title>If Jesus Is the Answer, What Is the Question? - James J. Genova PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In If Jesus Is the Answer, What Is the Question?, Dr. Genova reflects on six important questions, each posed by God to his people in the Hebrew scriptures. God asks these questions because we need to examine our own experiences and to use our reason to gain an improved understanding of God, ourselves, our community, and our interrelationships.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The questions are: &lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt; Who is your Lord? 
&lt;br&gt; Who are you? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; What do you need? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Do you understand? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; What will God do? &lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt; How will you respond? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek each question and the dialogue with God recounted in the Old Testament. Continue into the Gospels as Jesus asks these same questions. As Jesus said, You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life (John 5: 3940).&lt;/p&gt;" />
