  <title>Sorry Not Sorry - Angela N. Parris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You cannot give meaning to someone elses life by demeaning your own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God said, I Am who I Am (Ex 3:14). So why shouldnt we boldly declare the same? And if were fully transparent, it would sound something like this: Im nobody and Im somebody special. God is a divine craftsman, do you agree? Then why is it so hard to delight in His craftsmanship? (That would be ushumankind!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible consists of many warnings to steer clear of arrogance and high-minded behaviors. After all, pride was the sin that did Satan in. Still, down through the years, well-meaning Christians have applied human logic to these instructions, and as a result, the world sees weakness and is unimpressed with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldnt it be powerful to see the resources and collective gifts of believers come to full effect against the ills of this world? Just what is keeping us from unleashing that fearfully and wonderfully made person within? Insecurity, jealousy, and self-doubt have zapped the life out of Gods children for too long. Sorry, Not Sorry celebrates the privilegesthe exclusive benefits and favorthat come with belonging to Christ. Its time to begin replacing guilt with grace and Im sorry with Thank you. In fact, the only apology that will be made is to God. Hes the one who lit the light inside of you. Have you hidden that light under a bushel? Repent, break free, and ignite the life you were made for in Christ! You wont be sorry that you did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
