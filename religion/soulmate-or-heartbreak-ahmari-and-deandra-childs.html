In this book, we will be providing our testimonies about our mistakes, failures and victories in relationships. In this book we will be giving you a man and woman point of view about different topics concerning relationship and marriages. In addition, there is powerful insight and revelations about love from the word of God. We will be revealing all the devils weapons that he will try to use to destroy relationships. We will also talk about our battles, disagreements and how we overcame the devil together through the word of God. You may have failed and made some bad decisions. We wants you to know, that the only victory in failure is not getting up again. My wife and I have both failed and made mistakes in past relationships. We both have been divorced.

When God does it, he does it right! When God blessed me with my wife, God blessed me best. Proverbs 10:22 (The blessings of the Loerd, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. We are rich in joy, peace, love, and the greatest of all, Christ Jesus. Yes, we fuss and disagree at times, but through it all, we WIN!!!" />
