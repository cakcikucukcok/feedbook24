  <title>Sowing Seeds of Your Wishes &amp; Reaping the Fruits of Your Work - Wusu Takyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sowing and Reaping is one of the most invoked principles from the Bible. In as much as it is an essential principle it is either misunderstood or deliberately misinterpreted. Either misunderstood or misinterpreted, it does not assist the sincere truth seeker in his effort to faithfully apply the principle for his benefit to glorify God. To misunderstand it or buy into the misinterpreted forms of it denies a person what would have been his rightful reward if he understood and applied the right Biblical version of the law. Worse still, the distorted version lays the basis for potentially firm separation of that person from God. This happens when a person realises that what he has long been promised to reap if he sows into a ministry or pastors life does not materialise. Something which from day one of the promise was not going to happen because every seed brings forth the fruit of its kind but not the fruit of other seed which is not of its kind. This book is not primarily concerned about the interpreters who consciously distort the message of grace as indicated in Jude 1: 4, but concerned about the faithful who have misunderstood the law and even fallen prey to the interpreters spoken about by Jude. The faithful is here in this book delivered from sowing wrong seeds and born again into sowing the right seeds which brings forth their kind by the immutable power of the just God. The illuminating power of God enshrined in his word is used to shed light on life changing seeds and the fruits they bear." />
