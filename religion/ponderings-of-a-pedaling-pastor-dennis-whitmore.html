  <title>Ponderings of a Pedaling Pastor - Dennis Whitmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How often do you see what youre looking at? Imagine yourself relaxing in your favorite caf or sitting in your favorite chair at home. You immerse yourself in a story that only takes five minutes to read, but it stays on your mind all day. You mull over its insights, consider its lessons, and you may even say to yourself, I never thought of it that way before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ponderings of a Pedaling Pastor&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of true stories and short reflections that will inspire you to reconsider many things you may not have thought to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Whitmore is the senior pastor of Hilltop Christian Fellowship in Clear Spring, Maryland. Born and raised in Baltimore, he graduated with a BS in business administration from Towson University. From health club trainer and manager to ordained ministry in 1995, Dennis has journaled and logged a collection of insights on life called Points to Ponder. At first they were among a series of ninety-second messages on a Christian radio station. Then the transcripts became a column in a local Hagerstown paper for fourteen years. Since 2008, they again are on the radio (WJEJ 1240 AM, Hagerstown, Maryland). They take five minutes to read but will keep you thinkingponderingall day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my bike, in my devotion time, I long to know God. And in my searching He taught me to better understand me.
