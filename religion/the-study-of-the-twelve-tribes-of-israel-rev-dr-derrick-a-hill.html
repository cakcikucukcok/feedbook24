You see there are keys in the word of God that must be understood. To receive the total blessing of the promises we must be incompliance of Gods revelation for man. Within the keys we fine many things and within this material we are going to be looking for a greater understanding of Christ Jesus. I found the best way to do that is to study the tribes. For which will enhance our understanding of the Old Testament, and exactly how things connected to the New Testament.  And most of all give us better understanding of the Savoir our Lord Jesus Christ, through understanding His character. 
We will look at the four major characteristics of our Lord. To see how His perfection of the traits that combined together outlined the characteristic which the tribes possessed. Each trait is a key in our understanding of a closer walk with Christ. As we see the riches in getting closer to the perfect character of Christ Jesus in our daily life. To enhance our life in such a way that we can have victory in areas were we struggle. Not saying we are going to be perfect here on earth, but we can strive to be better each day. We will also decipher some keys which will unlock and give clarity in some things in the New Testament. That will enrich our lives forever! God Bless You! Lets get started. 
The power in Gods revelation instead of mans interpretation sets free some things that hinders.
