  <title>Living Springs - Jonathan Y. Martey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, the Lord Jesus stood by the well of Jacob in Samaria when a woman who had come to fetch water engaged Him in a conversation, as recorded in the Gospel according to Saint John, chapter four. This thirsty Samaritan woman had come to get natural water, but Jesus ended up offering her living water. The Samaritan woman said to Jesus, Sir, give me this water so that I wont get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapters of Living Springs: Refreshing the Soul have been drawn from deep wells of inspiration through prayer, worship, and the study of the Word of God. The chapters of Living Springs: Refreshing the Soul as well the contents of the chapters, centre on everyday issues of life. Each chapter ends with a prayer and suggested Scripture quotations for further meditation. But I believe that the Holy Spirit will breathe upon souls each time the pages of Living Springs: Refreshing the Soul are opened and read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trust that each chapter of Living Springs: Refreshing the Soul will indeed reflect what the Lord said to the Samaritan woman: Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life (John 4:1314 NIV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devotional pieces contained in Living Springs Refreshing the Soul are great sources of inspiration.. I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Rev Dr. Philip Laryea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am confident Living Springs Refreshing the Soul is a Spirit-filled volume that will transform your life from glory to glory and I recommend it wholly.&lt;/p&gt;
