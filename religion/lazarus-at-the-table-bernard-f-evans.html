  <title>Lazarus at the Table - Bernard F. Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Lazarus at the Tale&lt;/I&gt; is the fruit of more than two decades of instructing students in the social teachings of the Catholic Church. For most of these years Bernard Evans has taught graduate students. Lately he also teaches lay Catholics engaged in parish ministry and enrolled in diocesan ministry formation programs. This book is written specifically for the latter group.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Evans agrees with the bishops of the United States who insist that any Catholic education that does not include Catholic social teaching is not fully Catholic. And so he writes clearly, concisely, and convincingly about how Catholic social teaching addresses such contemporary issues as human dignity, abortion, assisted suicide and euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, the death penalty, war, family, marriage, poverty, superfluous income, just wages, unions, peace, solidarity, and many more. Excerpts from the church&#39;s official teachings in papal documents abound throughout the book.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Bernard Evans holds the Virgil Michel Ecumenical Chair in Rural Social Ministries at Saint John&#39;s School of Theology&#39;seminary, Collegeville, Minnesota.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
