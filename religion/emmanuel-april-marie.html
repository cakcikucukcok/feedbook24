      <meta name="description" content="Emmanuel tells the story of Jesus&#39; life by using all four of the Gospels, (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) and part of the first chapter of the book of Acts and part of I Corinthians.     Learn the story of Jesus&#39; life: where He was born, how He lived, and what He taught. See how He resisted the temptations of the devil, how He healed people and cast out demons. Discover why He went to the cross, how He rose from the dead, and why so many people love Him today.     This book follows Jesus&#39; earthly life from the very beginning of the Gospel record, through His many trials and His confrontations with the religious leaders of the day. It also tells the accounts of His miracles, betrayal, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.     This book is NOT intended to take the place of the Bible, but it may help you understand the story of Jesus&#39; life better by giving you a more chronological account of it; however, nothing can ever be more complete or accurate than the Bible itself.
