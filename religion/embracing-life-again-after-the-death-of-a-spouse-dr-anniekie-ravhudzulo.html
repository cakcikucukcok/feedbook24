  <title>Embracing Life Again After the Death of a Spouse - Dr Anniekie Ravhudzulo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; text-indent: 0pt;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sitb-font-size-7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hen someone we love dies, our whole world is knocked off balance. One of the most common and yet difficult feelings you experience is isolation. It seems no one understands what you are going through. And many of us are so busy, you dont take the time to fully grieve and, therefore, heal from your losses. It is very true that people who are grieving often feel extremely tired because the process of grieving usually requires physical and emotional energy. The grief you are feeling is not just for the person who died, but also for the unfulfilled wishes and plans for the relationship with the person. Death often reminds most of the people of past losses or separations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 6pt; text-indent: 1em;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remember, there are a number of conditions that can make it harder for you as a person to successfully make it through the grief process. For example, sudden losses are harder to deal with than ones that have been anticipated. With anticipated losses, the knowledge that a loss will occur allows people to prepare, both by feeling grief before the fact of the loss and also by planning ways to minimize the negative impact of the loss when it does occur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 6pt; text-indent: 1em;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The loss of a spouse, lover, child, parent, or best friend is usually more deeply felt than the loss of more distant relations and friends. This is because such central relationships have long and deeply felt histories and an intensity of attachment that does not occur with more distant relationships. Central relationships are more deeply and significantly knitted into the grieving persons sense of self, and thus leave a bigger hole in the grieving persons sense of self when they are lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 6pt; text-indent: 1em;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I discovered that when things are going badly, whether in the family or work environment, most of us strive mightily to improve our situations. But what if the way to overcome a series of losses and failures is just to sink into them? We all go through trials and tribulations. Everyone has difficult situations in their life. It is the way we look at them, and the way we handle those situations. I believe it is the struggle we must endure to gain the strength needed to break through the barriers. With every victory comes the strength we need to overcome the obstacles and move forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 6pt; text-indent: 1em;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people today give up easily because of what you may call emotional downturn. This book in your hand has been written and carefully thought out with you in mind. It has been written to bring you out of your sociological pit and emotional defeat. I therefore gladly recommend this book to your reading that you may be built in His grace. I believe that God will never give you more than you can handle. You often wonder how some people cope with their situations in life, I often hear people saying, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;dont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;think&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;could&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;deal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; but we dont know what strength lies within us, until the time comes to face the challenge. The harder the struggle, the sweeter the victoryNo test, no rewards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
