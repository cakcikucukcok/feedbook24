  <title>Relevance of Sacrifice - Alex Ndukwe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sacrifice comes with a price. There are levels and types of sacrifices. Whatever the case, the awesome sacrifice in history is the sacrifice for eternal life, for which Jesus offered himself for humanity. No one on earth has paid this type of sacrifice. Indeed, it is possible for someone to give up his life for another person to live. Such a sacrifice is only to salvage (not redeem) the person from temporary death by flesh. However, the sacrifice Jesus paid is to deliver us from both the first and second deaths. Therefore, if one values the sacrifice Jesus paid for the salvation of his soul, there is no sacrifice that is too much for such a person to render in terms of evangelism, intercessory prayer, church planting, and spending and being spent for the work of God here on earth. I think this is what Pastor Alex Ndukwe intends to convey to his readers in this book. He wants us to learn the secret of sacrifice, which Christ has paid, for us follow after his footsteps. So take a step of sacrifice and make sacrifice wherever you may be (Yoroms Gani, PhD)." />
