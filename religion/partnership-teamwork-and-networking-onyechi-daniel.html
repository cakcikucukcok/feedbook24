  <title>Partnership, Teamwork and Networking - Onyechi Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God will not trust any of us with all the gifts and abilities required for all round victory; this will breed destructive pride. God does not only want us to depend on Him, but also to depend on one another. We are created to compliment one another. The Bible says clearly that as each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God (1Peter 4:10). This book shows you why and how to start prayer partnerships. Prayer partnership is not only for young believers; many mature intercessors and fronline ministers have been saved from costly mistakes and death by the revelations and inputs of their prayer partners. Every pastor or frontline minister needs personal intercessors, or a team, working closely with them. This book discusses the raising and operations of personal intercessors and how to do team ministry. The present spiritual landscape is difficult for lone-rangers to survive for too long; it takes common sense and humility to accept that you need help. This book discusses team ministry, with testimonies; and with details on church/land deliverance. The Church will gain huge victory when pastors and leaders would stop fighting one another and employ networking as a compulsory option in spiritual warfare. The author shares deep revelations on the principles of networking. Every intercessor or minister needs to read this book!!!" />
