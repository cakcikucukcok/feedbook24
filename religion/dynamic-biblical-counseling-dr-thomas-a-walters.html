  <title>Dynamic Biblical Counseling - Dr. Thomas A. Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Special edition of Dynamic Biblical Counseling is
dedicated to the American homeowner. The American dream
of homeownership that is available to everyone has been sold
to the American public; however, not everyone is financially or
educationally prepared for home ownership. It seems that the
American homeowner has not the education regarding how to
prevent foreclosure. Perhaps it is not completely the homeowners
fault, because often times unscrupulous and predatory realtors,
investors, mortgage companies and even loss mitigation companies
have sometimes compounded the problem. This fact, coupled
with a lack of education regarding financial budgeting has turned
the American Dream into an American Nightmare. Preventing
this nightmare is the purpose of this book and mission of Gold
Cross of America." />
