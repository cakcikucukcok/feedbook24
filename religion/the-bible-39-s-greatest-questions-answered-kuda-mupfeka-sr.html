  <title>The Bible&#39;s Greatest Questions Answered - Kuda Mupfeka Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an amalgamation and skillful blending of revelation, spiritual insight, academics, research and refined biblical theology. This work caters for the unbeliever, born again Charismatic, Pentecostal, Evangelical, mainline Religious Traditionalist, student, skeptic and atheist  there is something for everyone in this revered and well researched work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the few books of its kind that blends scholastic wisdom, academic research, and historical actualities with fresh bible based revelation. The author does not bid to coax or cajole you to go with his school of thought neither does he bestow a myopic viewpoint, but uses The Word to explain The Word and balances it with authentic historical facts, substantiated theological facts and leaves you in a place where you can choose either to believe history, astuteness, scripture or academics  which are all intermarried in this imposing and revered work. Go through this work, not as a denigrator, but as a student, maintain an open mind and you will just be startled how certain mysteries can be solved so simply through divine wisdom that can still be proved by science, history actualities and adroitly balanced biblical theology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also thrown two bonus chapters in this book  Chapter 9 that deals with How to Study your Bible in a Transforming Way. The chapter will help you to: &lt;br&gt;
	Ask the right questions &lt;br&gt;
	Read the Bible topically &amp; Systematically&lt;br&gt; 
	Maintain an open mind and a receptive spirit&lt;br&gt; 
	Be prayerful and ask for the leading of The Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt; 
	Move in Revelation Knowledge&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 10 is the bridge between revelation and scholastic astuteness that will help us in Bringing The Balance. I pray that this book will be a great blessing to you and that a hunger for God and for Gods Word will arise inside you. Read this book with an open mind and with a prayerful heart and be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
