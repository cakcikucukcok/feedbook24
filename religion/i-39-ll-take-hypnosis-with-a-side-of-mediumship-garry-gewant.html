  <title>I&#39;ll Take Hypnosis with a Side of Mediumship: - Garry Gewant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered how professional Mediums come to have faith in their psychic and mediumistic abilities? Join Garry Gewant - NJ medium, hypnotist and educator - on his spiritual evolution. From his childhood encounter with a ghostly apparition at age five, through denial and eventual validation of his psychic abilities, Garrys humor and easygoing storytelling will keep you spellbound as he describes his metaphysical exploration. 
Share his life-changing synchronicities and experiences at various metaphysical retreats with authors and mentors Dr. Brian Weiss, James Van Praagh, and John Holland, among others.
Garrys unique voice brings you into the room as he uses hypnosis to help clients overcome smoking, fears, and detrimental behavior. Be there in his dentists chair as Garry undergoes a root canal using self-hypnosis instead of Novocain! 
Eventually, Garry recognizes that his clients loved ones in spirit are enhancing his hypnosis sessions, with profound results. 
When he recognizes and accepts the synchronicities in his life, he gains the resolve to pursue his abilities as a psychic, medium, and past life regressionist. And in so doing, Garry forms a stronger connection with the spirit realm that leads him - and YOU, the reader - on a unique spiritual journey." />
