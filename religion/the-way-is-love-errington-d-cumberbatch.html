  <title>The Way Is Love - Errington D. Cumberbatch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If Jesus is the Way and Jesus is love and the Bible is truth, having the love of Jesus in our hearts is the way to abundant life on earth as it is in heaven!
Many of us have aspects of our lives we would like to change.  Anyone who doubts that need only look at the self-help section of online or brick and mortar bookstores.  Since more and more are published each year, its reasonable to assume they dont work  at least not for everyone.  In the meantime, the one book and person who can help are sometimes overlooked.
Gods Word and His creative power are the answers to healing and transforming your life.  In his book, The Way Is Love:  How to Walk in Love and Forgiveness, author Errington D. Cumberbatch teaches you how to use the principles found in Gods Word to change your life and your way of thinking.  You will learn how to recognize good thoughts versus toxic thoughts and to raise your level of awareness.  Youll learn that you can speak things into existence, whether financial shortages or gains, sickness or health, failure or success.
God wants to be involved in all aspects of your life. Cumberbatch will teach you to walk in love and forgiveness and how to program your spirit for success. When you bring faith into your heart, you will see Gods creative power to change the circumstances of your life.
And yet I will show you a still more excellent way,
One that is better by far - 
LOVE
? In association with God, the Son and the blessed Holy Spirit." />
