  <title>The Other Bible Code - Val Pym</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Book Overview&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the future hold for Planet Earth? That is the critical question for these troubled times. Christians believe that the Bible holds the answer. Ultimately the Kingdom of God will come On Earth as it is in Heaven. That much is certain; however just how and when that will happen is often the subject of debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Other Bible Code&lt;/i&gt;, the author shows that God has encrypted the destiny of the Church and the world into the history of His chosen people Israel. This Code brings break-through revelation, which will encourage the Church to rise up and fulfil its destiny in the Earth. The Church of Jesus Christ is the instrument through which God works to fulfil His purposes in the world. Events in Israels history will guide us on whom the ends of the ages have come. (1 Corinthians 10:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code shows that we are living in very significant times and, though the future holds much upheaval, there is also great victory and glory ahead for the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pym, a retired [lay] pastor, offers a new perspective on interpreting the Bible to determine what will happen during the end times and how Christians should focus their efforts now, in light of that ultimate destiny. Pyms prose is clear and she cites scripture regularly in order to support her interpretation.the topics Pym discusses are inherently controversial.many readers will be in for an argument. Others will find themselves renewed and inspired in their efforts to live out their faith in a meaningful way that will change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;For readers fascinated by the end times or typology, this book will offer a somewhat unusual perspective.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CALEB Reviews&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;.&lt;i&gt; The Other Bible Code&lt;/i&gt; is a well researched and informative book which ties together the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures in fascinating and soundly Biblical ways..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[It] makes plain many hidden concepts in the Bible and brings them out the shadows and exposes them to the light.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal M. Lindsey &quot;Sister Crystal Mary Lindsey&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read this book, the eyes of your heart will be opened. To me it felt like a light had been turned on in my mind as I recognised the TRUTH in what she had written. 
I was amazed, why hadn&#39;t I seen this before? 
 As I read this book I felt a stirring and an discernment of how important Israel&#39;s role is, to Christ&#39;s return. Read it and find out for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;" />
