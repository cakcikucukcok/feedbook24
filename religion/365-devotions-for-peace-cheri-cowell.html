For 400 years God had been silent. Not a word. Not a peep. Had he forgotten his people? Did he no longer hear their cries? Then the most incredible thing happened. The heavens broke forth in praise. Shepherds shouted their joy, and that joy reverberated over the mountains. The Lord had heard their cries. He has heard yours and has come to comfort. He brings comforting peace into this dark world, peace into your world. Are you in need of comfort and peace? He has come for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
