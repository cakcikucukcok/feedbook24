  <title>The Enigma of Justice - Morris A. Inch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While justice is thought indispensible for a healthy society, its complex character gives rise to conflicting applications. Accordingly, The Enigma of Justice serves as an appropriate title. In greater detail, the course is set with a consideration of justice in context of the prophets. These were faced with the unenviable task of fine-tuning the monarchy to its covenant ideals. The topic is then treated in its classical setting, as one of the cardinal virtues. This introduces a series of competing theories, more or less compatible with one another. In still greater detail, the text treats a wide range of related topics, such as justice in conjunction with poverty, mercy, and freedom. In conclusion, it touches on justice from an international perspective." />
