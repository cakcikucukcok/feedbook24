  <title>In Search Of - William Epps</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Dr. William Epps, a licensed and ordained minister, believes in preaching and teaching Gods word to enhance Christian education and Biblical knowledge about Jesus Christ. In In Search Of, he makes a trip through the Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, to convey what the Bible offers as a plan of salvation.
In Search Of is based on two views, the Old and the New Testaments. The Old Testament is the foundation that was laid, and the New Testament is the fulfillment, which was, which is, and which is to come. Epps explores a variety of scriptural-related subjects such as law and the covenant, combination of law and Psalms, major and minor prophets, baptism, communion, evangelism, and the Baptist doctrine. He provides further discussion on the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Timothy, Titus, and Revelations.
Shedding light on the important messages contained within the Bible, In Search Of helps Christians better understand the true basics of the Bible and its history." />
