  <title>The Church of the Living God - Grace Otegbade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is special, unusual, but not formidable. You can hardly fully read it without the bible; so it is designed to attract Christian world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the long-standing Church controversies about being under grace, and not under the law, there are conflicting ideas of what born-again Christians obligations to the Lord are supposed to be if you are under grace. This book attempts to clarify this, in details, and should settle the matter for true truth seekers for good. This is one of the highlights of the book because this matter touches, not only life, but eternal life too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It points out (not with proud holier- than- thou attitude) areas of life Christians need examine &amp; improve upon, with Gods help- but it is not a book of gloom and doom. With every such area attention is drawn to, there are way outs and exhortation of what can be done.  pointing to God, (not the books author) for the Answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author hopes you will not hate the book, but welcome it as Exhortations from a loving sister to her well-beloved fellow Christians, and prays it serves as ladder to Newness of life in the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book enhances the loving kindness of God to us; and gently tries to wake the Church up, so we stop incurring Gods anger, and start seeking His Favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another highlight of this book is the Call for united Fasting-Prayers- crying out to God, humbly and genuinely for the Holy Spirit- anointing and heaven-sent Revival; to help us truly repent, be forgiven and be renewed. Thus seeking for His compassion, it is certain that our Saviour and Lord will in no wise cast us out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
