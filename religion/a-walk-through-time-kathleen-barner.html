  <title>A Walk Through Time - Kathleen Barner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who would have ever thought that a stroll back through ones childhood neighborhood would have opened the door to the very real existence of another realm of life hidden behind the scenes of our lives? Thats exactly what happened as I walked back to visit the simplicity of yesterday, only to face again what I thought was the great dichotomy of today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that ordinary park bench, on that not-so-long-ago morning, my life was forever transformed. For it was there that the unveiling of a connection to a phenomenal power and supernatural ability took me on a journey into incredible insights, powers, and the miraculous healing that exists in the center of all mankind. And it was also there that I first encountered the Voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shown the purpose of time and the great secret it holds. Visions and songs and strangers revealed insights that kept taking me further into the great ascending truth thats been hidden in the midst of us the whole time. Dreams became avenues of incredible wisdom. Laughter and tears carried me through realms of experiences. This is the very thing weve been looking for throughout all of our existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the journey comes full circle, any mysteries of life fade into the simplicity thats been revealed and that has been with us the whole entire time. This is meant to be our home, and now we &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
