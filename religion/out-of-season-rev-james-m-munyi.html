  <title>Out of Season - Rev. James M. Munyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects of my professional practice and which I have truly owned and enjoyed is writing daily reflections for my coworkers. Herein are assorted reflective subjects to encourage identity focus and meaningmaking in places where we are placed for Kingdom representation. Kingdom citizens must carry their identity wherever they are placed, particularly in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of Wednesday, the 23rd of May 1973, a Kingdom citizen, Justus Mbulikhe, introduced me to King Jesus because he carried his Kingdom identity with him. This fits well with our Kingdom witness, our new identity in Christ Jesus as Christian believers. St. Paul, quoting Aratus the Greek poet, puts it beautifully: For in him we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a professional chaplain in a hospital context, I help patients, families, and staff discover, utilize, and draw from their own spiritual reservoirs. As I offer compassionate presence, I am sensitively careful to respect individuals spiritual state. And while I have no personal agenda, I allow my Kingdom identity to speak for itself. I hope that these reflections will nurture the readers spirit as they have nurtured mine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
