&lt;p&gt;I will recommend Opened Our Hearts to all people who love children. Sometimes on the way to a dream you get lost and find a better one  Julienne and Ron did. Their dream to love children came true as they granted my sons wish. Now I hold another priceless treasure; through my sons illness, he became the wish granter. Thanks Julienne!&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your heart will rejoice as you meet true heroes, children, and parents granted a dream experience by Make-A-Wish. Julienne Lentz beautifully shares with readers the joys and challenges of working with youngsters facing life-threatening illnesses and all the individuals who see to it that these dreams come true.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dick Wainwright, nationally recognized author of various works for children and adults&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opened Our Hearts is recommended reading for all who love childrenold or young, single or married. Julienne Lentzs story of how [she and her husband] turned a problem of their own into a blessing for others is inspiring. As a parent of one of their children, I felt an immediate bond with the other parents, as we have all been touched by their gracious charity, encouraged by their hope, and blessed by their love.&lt;p&gt;
