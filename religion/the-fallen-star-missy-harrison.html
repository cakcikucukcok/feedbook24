  <title>The Fallen Star - Missy Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Fallen Star tells the story of a bright little stars journey to self-realization, not to mention self-confidence. It follows the adventures of a little star who focuses so much on what others think about him that he begins to lose his light and even falls from the sky! 
In light of this, he convinces himself that he doesnt belong in the sky. But as he aimlessly wanders around on Earth, he soon discovers that he certainly does not belong there either. Worried that he doesnt quite fit in anywhere, he is soon set straight by a group of children, who show him the situation in a new light. One special child helps him realize that, for those who are true to themselves and doing what they love, what others think does not matter." />
