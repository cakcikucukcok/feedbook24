  <title>People Have Problems  and I Can Do Something About It - Ron Hullett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The purpose of life is a life of purpose. Robert Byrne &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have officiated many funerals in which I and the family communicate that we are not here to simply mourn the death but to celebrate the life of the deceased. Have you ever attended such a memorial service? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in which no one struggles to come up with something great to say. This person impacted, influenced and inspired, others everywhere and anywhere they went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the movie Braveheart William Wallace states that, &quot;Every man dies, not every man really lives.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our U.S. Army encourages, Be all you can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are more important in the lives of others than you probably realize but you can most definitely increase your impact, your value and significance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to live a life worth celebrating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to do that very thing with every page of this book by inspiring you, causing you to want and do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page one of chapter one may begin somewhat controversial for you, then again it may not, but please, read on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
