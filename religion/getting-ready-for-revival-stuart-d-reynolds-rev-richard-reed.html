  <title>Getting Ready for Revival - Stuart D. Reynolds, Rev. Richard Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pervaded by the stench of self-satisfaction, self-obsession, and self-justification, the Church in the West, overcome by its culture, finds herself in an ailing condition very few seem to want to mention, never mind confront to correct. Biblical imperatives often go unheeded in the pew, largely because they are unsounded from the pulpit, as we live out our own dark and more sinister version of the Emperors New Clothes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Drawing primarily from the scriptures, along with other revival writers such as Finney, Tozer, Ravenhill, Getting Ready for Revival seeks to stimulate our minds out of our ignorance of Gods Word and stir our hearts over our forgetfulness of God, returning us to the wells we did not dig (Deut. 6:1012) of Gods provision and insistence that we may not die in the graves our own wells are.&lt;/p&gt;" />
