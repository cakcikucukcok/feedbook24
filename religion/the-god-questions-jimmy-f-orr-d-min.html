  <title>The God Questions - Jimmy F. Orr D. Min</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the foundational Christian beliefs is that God has spoken. Most of the time in the Bible, God makes statements. At other times, rather than making statements, God asks questions. And Gods questions provoke serious thought. &lt;br /&gt;
Many people have questions they would love to ask God. Many more have questions about God. But the most important questions are the ones God is asking us. The God Questions explores these and other questions God asked people in the Bible: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Where are you?&lt;br /&gt;
 Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&lt;br /&gt;
 Why are you so angry?&lt;br /&gt;
 Where have you come, from and where are you going?&lt;br /&gt;
 Why are you so afraid?&lt;br /&gt;
 Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?&lt;br /&gt;
 Who do you say that I am?&lt;br /&gt;
 When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions God asked people of ancient times are the same questions God is asking us today. Discover the questions God is asking you, and in doing so, find out what God has in mind for your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
