  <title>The Books of Simion - Ivory Simion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Warning: The Books of Simion are the most Profound books of knowledge that have ever been delivered to the Gentile nations. The Books of Simion are written for kings and all in authority only so kings and all in authority can determine what is best for the people.
The Books of Simion are the books of records that are referred to as the books of remembrance that are written for kings and all in authority so kings and all in authority are not dishonored and their kingdoms are not destroyed by deceptions (Ezra 4:1415 and Malachi 3:16).
The Books of Simion are the translation of the Holy Bible and the ancient scriptures by those who are scattered, whose ancestors were slaves and persecuted in Egypt for 430 years. Later in the latter days, ascendants were taken to a foreign land named America on ships in bondage and held there as slaves and persecuted for 430 years that the Holy Bible has identified as Gods chosen people and Gods firstborn.
There is no other interpretation and translation of the Holy Bible and the end-time prophesies of the God of Abraham by any other race of people on the planet earth that is better(Genesis 15:1314, Acts 7:67, Deuteronomy 28:68, Jeremiah 30:3, Jeremiah 30:18, Luke 21:24, John 11:52, Joel 3:1, and Exodus 4:22).
The Books of Simion will connect all of the dots or events in history together with the Holy Bible and the ancient scriptures to bring events and scriptures together, to make sense of what happened in our past, to understand what is happening in our present, and to determine what will happen in the future. The readers will learn more about the Holy Bible, God and the devil, the extraterrestrials, the old black African dominion, and the new white Gentile dominion from the Books of Simion than they have learned and understood from the combined books and learning institutions they have been exposed to all of the their lives. For the first time in the readers lives, they will understand what they could never understand before. Without the Books of Simion, the readers will go from university to university constantly learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth (2 Timothy 3:7).
All of the great secrets, including the mystery of the gospel, have been revealed in the Books of Simion. Because the world was started over to give the Gentiles a second chance for salvation in the world we live in today, the final outcome from all of our actions and choices of today will be revealed, as well as what we all must do to inherit the earth. Absolutely nothing is more important than knowing the final outcome from last time before we make our final choices this time.
