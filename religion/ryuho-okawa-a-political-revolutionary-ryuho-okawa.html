  <title>Ryuho Okawa: A Political Revolutionary - Ryuho Okawa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Abe was inaugurated as Prime Minister in December 2012. 
And for the past few years, the Nikkei average was around 7,000 yen at the lowest, but in 2013 it went up to around 16,000 yen. The Abenomics that started with &quot;monetary easing of a different dimension&quot; made a steady progress. 
Furthermore, the person who had been strongly proposing this powerful monetary easing plan since a few years before was none other than World Teacher Master Ryuho Okawa. 
In this book, the Founder and the Master of Happy Science Group as well as the Father of Happiness Realization Party, Master Okawa lays down the guiding principles and the ways to breakthrough on the topics of economy, finance, nuclear power plant, foreign diplomacy, social welfare, and society with aging population and a falling birth rate. 
This book reveals the political philosophy necessary in today’s age of political confusion that can be represented through incidents such as the failure of democratizing movement in the Middle East called Arab Spring, the military coup in Thailand, and the rise of power of non-democratic nation China. A must-read book that is written with all the author’s might." />
