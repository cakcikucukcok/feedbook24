  <title>God’S Set-Apart People - Mike Morra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the origin and expansion of the Judeo/Christian belief.  The neo/technologies and ideo/evolution facing the 21st century have set the stage for a revised current and relevant history of the moral and intellectual journeys of the human species. These were Eras that became the spiritual, theological, and ideational marvels of enlightenment that occurred over millennia, always set within the context of Divine freedom.  This reworked history can be best told in two parts.  Part I tells us that God chose to make use of set-apart people to accomplish His Divine plan for Planet Earth;  first, as Ancient Hebrews, then as Caucasian Alpha-Males, and finally as Evangelical Christians. Part II of this unique account involved all about Jesus, the incarnate God, sent by the Father to help humanity understand His nature and intentions.   Jesus became the visible expression of the invisible Deity.  Accordingly, set-apart people were needed: (a) to counteract the all-encompassing, moral depravity of the Ancient World; (b) to set up the means of worship that pleases, not offends, Gods essential righteosness; and (c) to reveal the organic, scientific and mathematical truths of our physical reality.  In Part II, Jesus becomes the focus of salvation, sanctification, resurrection, and eternal glorification for each soul.  Thus, Gods Intelligent Design of Planet Earth" />
