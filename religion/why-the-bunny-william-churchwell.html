  <title>Why the Bunny - William Churchwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why the Bunny&lt;/i&gt; is about Easteralways a very special time for the Churchwell Familybecause it is a reminder of what Jesus did for all of us. Author William Churchwell has created a delightful book for children, which explains the role the Easter Bunny plays at Easter. When his children were young, they believed the Easter Bunny was a helper for Jesus. Now that his children are older and understand the true meaning of Easter, it is important to show their own children that the Easter Bunny is a symbol of what our Lord did for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids all over the world wake up on Easter excited about the Easter Bunny, because they know that they are going to find gifts, candy, and beautifully-colored eggs. Jesus wants us to do the same thing every day. He wants us to get up in the morning excited because we are on the hunt to find Him, as children do on Easter for Easter eggs. Jesus wants everyone to learn to accept Him. He wants us to see all of the wonderful gifts that he has given us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With charming, original illustrations, Why the Bunny offers a very different perspective on the age-old story of the Easter Bunny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
