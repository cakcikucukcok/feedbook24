  <title>Disciple&#39;s Diary - Cinthia W. Pratt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Disciples Diary is the second book in Cindees series written for women journeying to become all that God has created them to be. This edition is a collection of poems, devotional teachings, and reflective narrative, intended to encourage and to provoke thought in those discipled daughters; who may discover that they are now traveling across terrain much like the territories that the heroine in the story crosses. Her Valley of Shadows may be found sitting at the bedside of a terminally ill loved one. Her Wide Wilderness of Want may appear in the form of a bankruptcy or through the loss of a business or a home. Divorce-court proceedings may compose the walls of the dark pit of loneliness, in which the disciple daughter now sits trapped as she watches the fogs of confusion and doubt begin to roll in overhead. A rebellious child, an unfaithful spouse, and seemingly countless unanswered prayers may all contribute to the tangled briers and twisted branches of the wilderness thicket that blocks the suns warmth and light from the path on which the present-day sojourner now travels. Such is the terrain that might be traced on the map of a modern-day disciple daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearfully Female and Wonderfully Woman: Becoming All That God Created is the first book in Cindee&#39;s series and is designed to be a navigational guide for Christian women of all ages and backgrounds. While Disciples Diary is designed as a devotional collection; this book is more informational in format. Topics addressed in this study include body image, self -esteem, developing healthy friendships, growing old in a youth oriented culture, developing our spiritual gifts, and finding our place of ministry. Fearfully Female and Wonderfully Woman would be a valuable reference tool as well as a guide for individual or small group study.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bookstore.westbowpress.com/Products/SKU-000466986/Fearfully-Female-and-Wonderfully-Woman.aspx&quot;&gt;http://bookstore.westbowpress.com/Products/SKU-000466986/Fearfully-Female-and-Wonderfully-Woman.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
