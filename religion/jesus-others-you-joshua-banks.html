  <title>Jesus Others You - Joshua Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like you were feeding the world but you were starving yourself? Isnt this what Christianity is about, or is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young Christian, the phrase Jesus Others You (JOY) was common in my church circles because it reflected our responsibility to put the needs of others before ourselves, sometimes at the expense of ourselves. This type of thinking sounded good but was somewhat misleading and unbalanced, leaving me feeling incomplete. Has your church experience left you feeling that way too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Others You: The Self-Centered Gospel is not a promotion of selfish humanism. This book attempts to take a look at Christ-centered individuality with a focus on how unity with Christ is the key to becoming who you were designed to be. This Christ-centered individuality places you in the proper position to be the best benefit to those who are around you and are affected by your life. This controversial and thought-provoking work seeks to challenge your perspectives on Christ-centeredness and fan the spark of authenticity that will ignite you to discover the most complete version of who God created you to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
