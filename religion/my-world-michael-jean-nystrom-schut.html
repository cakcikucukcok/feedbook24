  <title>My World - Michael Jean Nystrom-Schut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Let me tell you how much fun it is to be a book writer! One of my friends recently said to me, I dont even know anyone whos ever READ a book, let alone WRITE one! I was amused.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Well you know its really not so hard to write a book. You just talk about what you feel, and organize your thoughts along the way. At some point, as you stay determined to make it happen, the book comes into the world.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;For me, now having compiled over 30 book-length manuscripts of various topics and subject matter, I have become more and more inclined to share the way I see the world with others along the way. You might call what I like to write about as having to do with personal philosophy, or individual world view. Everyone has a way they see their world; this book is part of how I see mine.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;It seems that all kinds of people have something to say about what life is and is not. I am like most people, so am no exception. I have come to enjoy giving such opinions and points of view with just about anyone who will listen.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;I wrote this book, MY WORLD: The First 50 Years, because I wanted to be sure and document the way life appeared to be to me at the half-century mark in my personal growth and evolution. I did it in a way that enables you to read right through it, or, if you prefer, you can take it slowly, over a one-year span of time, and think about the ideas and thoughts carefully. How you read the book is entirely up to you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Ten years earlier I had written a similar book (Earth Dwelling: An Owners Manual for Life) in order to share thoughts about the meaning and purpose of life. It is amazing the difference that ten years can make! I like to think that I am growing! Gee. Could that be? I sure hope so!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;People from the worlds of philosophy, religion and the popular culture are anxious to share the way they see the world with others. I have a passion to do that also, and so I wrote this book in order to summarize how things in life appeared to me. I could be way off - you decide for youself. At any rate, my world is MY way of seeing life...in YOUR world, you will see it your special way and that is part of the beauty of this life. Each person is free to see it differently, and that is our basic right to do so.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;I like that.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;I actually feel so strongly about what I am saying here that I created a web site (which is called HowIseetheworld.com) to talk about and share ideas with others. Take a look at it some time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Thoughts are powerful, and have a tendency to either make you great, or even destroy you before your time. So, think good thoughts!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;And enjoy the book as well!&lt;/P&gt;" />
