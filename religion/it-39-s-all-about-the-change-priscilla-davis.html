I encourage you to read the Scriptures that are suggested and then take time to journal your thoughts on that days lesson. It has been my experience that journaling your thoughts will help to write Gods Word in your heart and mind. Scripture recollection is greatly improved by this practice.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray that through this study you will receive all that God has in store for you. As you begin, sit down with your Bible and read the passage we will be covering.
