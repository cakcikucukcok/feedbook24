  <title>Listening for God&#39;s Voice - Ruth Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. In those days when you pray, I will listen.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah 29: 1112 NLT&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world of constant noise, it is no surprise that many of us struggle to tune in to hear what God has to say to us. Yet, God is very interested in every detail of our lives. He still speaks.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that God can communicate with you today as He did with Eve, Abraham, Samuel, and Moses?&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that He wants to have intimate conversations with you like He had with Mary, Zacchaeus, the Samaritan woman at the well, and Peter?&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe that He still performs miracles to make lame individuals walk again, as He did in the past?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this devotional that shares personal experiences and life lessons learnt from biblical characters and nature, Ruth Pearson encourages the reader to have a more intimate relationship with Father God. Her prayer is that you will be renewed and transformed by developing your own personal relationship with Father as you listen for His voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
