  <title>Jesus the Divine Human - William Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost everyone knows that December 25 is not really Jesuss birthday, and quite a few are aware that August 21 is his real birthday. There are many more things we were not taught about Jesus. An example: who was Jesus in human form? The information we were taught about Jesus is mostly incorrect. Those so-called churches fathers were more interested in prestige, control, wealth, and power. They werent really interested in learning about Jesus. How can you possibly learn anything about God when all your attention is on wealth, prestige, and controlling peoples lives? These are all the things God is not about.
Friends, theres a book I have been studying for many years titled The Urantia Book that has devoted 700 of its 2,097 pages about the life and teachings of Jesus, and the book has 2,097 pages. Being inspired by this text on Jesus, I wrote a book titled Jesus the Divine Human: From Higher Worlds. Check out the reality about Jesus that has been hidden for many years." />
