  <title>The Poetic Scriptures of John - Michael  D. Wester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The attention of audiences have been captivated by rhythm and rhyme. Who has not appreciated the works of Dr. Seuss or listening to poems that mimic &amp;ldquo;The Night Before Christmas&amp;rdquo;? Imagine if the Bible, God&amp;rsquo;s Word, were put into that format. Would that not also capture attention? Read the following excerpt about the circumstances surrounding the death of Lazarus. Read it slowly and with care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11:20 When the word had come to Martha&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
That Jesus was coming by,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
While Mary stayed inside the home,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
She went out to ask Him why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11:21 &amp;ldquo;Lord, if You had been here on time,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
My brother would not have died,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11:22 But I still know that God will give&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Whatever You ask,&amp;rdquo; she cried.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11:23 &amp;ldquo;Your brother,&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;will rise again.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
She replied without question,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11:24 &amp;ldquo;I know he&amp;rsquo;ll rise on the last day,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In the resurrection.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11:25 &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the resurrection and life,&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
To her was His reply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He who believes in Me will live,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Even if he should die.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11:26 &amp;ldquo;And everyone who is alive,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
And in Me their faith does cleave,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
These ones will never, ever die.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Is this what you believe?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is the beginning work of putting God&amp;rsquo;s Word to rhythm and rhyme. Enjoy the writings of the apostle John as you have read before but to the beat of a drum and to a sound that will impact your heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
