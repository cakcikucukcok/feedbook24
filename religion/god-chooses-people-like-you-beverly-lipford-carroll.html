  <title>God Chooses People Like You - Beverly Lipford Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The heroes of the Bible werent any more gifted or powerful than you are. They were flawed, ordinary people living ordinary lives and doing ordinary things. Their struggles and temptations were no different from ours. But they allowed their ordinary lives to be interrupted by God, who is anything but ordinary. They chose to obey God when they did not necessarily see a happy ending. And when they did, what we see as a remarkable hero in the Bible is just an ordinary person reflecting the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our capabilities are far less influential than the choices we make, and our choices become the stories of our lives. We can continue to serve the pain of our past and be held captive by what we wish we could change, or we can let our belief in the power of God overshadow the size of our enemy and the depth of our weakness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesnt need heroes. He wants you. His power and glory are most evident in your weakness. Your past is never too complicated or too far gone for God to redeem into something beautifulresurrection is His specialty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
