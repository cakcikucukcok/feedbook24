  <title>Come Share the Cookies - Diane Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victor Hugo once said There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come.
For 55 years, it had not even dawned on me that I was a writer.  My first clue should have been when I realized that there absolutely wasnt anything about which I didnt have an opinion.  For five years I published a weekly newsletter for my church.  No one else seemed to want to do it, and it was something that I loved doing.
The fourteen years that I worked as an Insurance Agent should also have given me a nudge.  I often gave group presentations that included stories about so many of my life experiences.  Many clients encouraged me to write them down and share them with others.  But it took a life-changing crisis that made me take a look within and find why God had placed me here.
I have written a collection of insights that I gained during the first half of my life.  Each chapter begins with a joke, a thought or a scripture that I believe God laid on my heart.  The body of each chapter consists of a relating experience, insight or lesson that I gained.  And each chapter is completed with a prayer.
I have noticed how people are enjoying inspirational books that are also a Quick read such as mine.  I submitted Chapter Five to the Indianapolis Star and it was published in the Faith and Values section of that newspaper.  I think that one sign that a book could be good is when the reader wants more.  Each person who has read these chapters did exactly that and asked if they can pass on to others what they have enjoyed or gained from my book.
I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read some of what I believe God has shown me in my life.  Come Share The Cookies.
Lord, bless this reader, Amen." />
