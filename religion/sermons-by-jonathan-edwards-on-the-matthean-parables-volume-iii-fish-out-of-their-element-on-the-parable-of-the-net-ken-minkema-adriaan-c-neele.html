  <title>Sermons by Jonathan Edwards on the Matthean Parables, Volume III: Fish Out of Their Element (on the Parable of the Net) - Ken Minkema, Adriaan C. Neele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This third volume of Sermons by Jonathan Edwards on the Matthean Parables contains a previously unpublished series of sermons by Edwards on Jesus&#39; Parable of the Net, as found in Matthew 13. Edwards preached these sermons in 1746, after the major phase of the Great Awakening had passed in New England and during the very months he was completing and publishing A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections, his masterful statement on the true and false signs of true grace. Therefore, this series is significant for its place in Edwards&#39; rich and evolving view of the nature of religious experience. To assist the reader, preceding the series are two introductions that describe Edwards&#39; preaching style and method, and provide an historical context. Prepared from the original manuscripts by the staff of the Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University, this series represents a significant addition to the available Edwards corpus that will be of interest to scholars, religious leaders, and general readers." />
