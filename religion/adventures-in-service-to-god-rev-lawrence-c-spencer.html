  <title>Adventures in Service to God - Rev. Lawrence C. Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had that sinking feeling that you were missing out on something very valuable in your ministry but just couldnt put your finger on it? Well, these resources for adventures in service to God for the church are valuable assets to those seeking a dynamic experience in Gods Kingdom work. To invest yourself in Larry Spencers Ministry of Helps Manual and Workbook can enhance your ministry and greatly format your service with usable hands on tools that complete your tool chest. Bring these practical things home and put them to work. Great results have already been seen from individuals who respect Gods Word and value what it can bring to the Board room as well as to the church service. You will not be sorry you invested in this training for you and your ministry team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rev. Lloyd Tremain, Paradise Community
Church of the Nazarene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Thorough, practical and much needed Biblically sound treatment. Wish it had been available 20 years ago when I could have used it to a great positive effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Wilderman, Retired Assemblies of God Pastor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the order and practical instruction presented will benefit all organizational levels of any Christian Church today.&lt;/p&gt;
