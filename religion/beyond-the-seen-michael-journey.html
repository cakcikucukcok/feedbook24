  <title>Beyond the Seen - Michael Journey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am deeply humbled and give all glory to God that you are now holding this book. I do not believe anything we do is by chance, nor is anything we experience whether seemingly good or bad. Most everyone throughout life is searching for greater meaning or purpose in who they are and what they do. A longing to know and understand why they are here and what ultimately is their destiny and birthright. This book recollects the journey within I also voyaged to seek out what the truth was to these most fundamental and foundational questions. I give all praise to God for by the Spirit He has guided me and convinced me to where I am now doubtless that Jesus Christ is our Lord, Savior and Redeemer. He was literally God in the flesh who was the defining Example on who we truly are and how we should live. His life, death and resurrection to eternity is the greatest Hope and Victory in all of history. I pray with all my being that you will seek out who this Jesus is for He absolutely has won my heart, and I am confident will also win yours if you truly come to know who He is. This book is my personal journey to know and live by the truth, full of stories, experiences, sorrows, challenges, heartbreaks, hope, love, passion, desire, visions, convictions and finally the revelation, wisdom and redemption in the joy of knowing who Christ Jesus truly is to all of mankind. This work is completely from the heart and I pray you will be encouraged by it and hopefully led to a more clear confidence in who you are and why you are here, and most importantly where you are going and what your true birthright really is. I give all praise and glory to God for He is worthy through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen" />
