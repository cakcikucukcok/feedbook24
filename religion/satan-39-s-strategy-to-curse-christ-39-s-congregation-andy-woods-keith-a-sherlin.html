  <title>Satan&#39;s Strategy to Curse Christ&#39;s Congregation - Andy Woods, Keith A. Sherlin</title>

What he has done is restore us to sound principles that come straight from the Bible. His book is a must for every assembly that wants to remain strong rather than go the way of the culture. I cannot recommend his book enough.&lt;/I&gt;  Dr. Mal Couch&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;In this work, the author sets out the biblical case for congregations being ruled by a plurality of Godly men, known as elders.

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Keith writes in a manner that is precise and with a fluidity of understanding of current day church leadership.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The tone of his writing is shared in love and there are no judgmental undertones that permeate his thoughts. I would wholly recommend this reading to all who profess Christ as their Lord.&lt;/I&gt;  Pamela Rogers&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Dr. Keith has presented a solid case for authoritative leadership in the church. His book is a call for us to return to biblical leadership and be presbyters instead of politicians.&lt;/I&gt;  Dr. C.V. Varnado&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Do you believe that your local assembly is full of conflict, confusion, and/or compromise? Are you familiar with the strategy of Satan and his methods to undermine the grace, love, and truth of Christ&#39;s body? This work makes a clear and convincing case that many problems in congregations occur because the body has adopted a flawed foundation of church government and doctrine that is more political than biblical. How much or to what degree has Satan made inroads into your spiritual family and leadership body? Read and judge for yourself and if necessary seek to apply the prescribed remedy to the problem.&lt;/P&gt;" />
