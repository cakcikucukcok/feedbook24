  <title>Secrets from Heaven: Scriptures That Will Help You Get Your Prayers Answered! - Latanya M. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Secrets from Heaven is a practical devotional guide that consists of Scriptures from the Bible on how to get our prayers answered. The only way to receive an answer from God is to learn the Scriptures. In gaining knowledge of who God is through his Word, we will understand the mind of God. When we understand the mind of God, we will begin to pray the Lord&#39;s will over our lives. However, in order for us to receive what we desire, our request must be in harmony with the principles of God&#39;s kingdom.  When we communicate with God, it allows him to give us divine counsel. When we do this, he will listen, and we can be certain that if God listens, he will give us a definite answer. God is ready to answer our prayers but we must ask him for his assistance. Therefore, we must pray with confidence and an expectation that God will answer us." />
