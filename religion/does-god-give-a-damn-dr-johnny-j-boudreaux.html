  <title>Does God Give a Damn? - Dr. Johnny J. Boudreaux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We tend to blame God for everything when things get out of hand. We tell people that God took our loved ones when they died, but then we never look back and think about what we are really saying. Is God really to blame for what happens, or is it our sin? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Does God Give a Damn?, author and pastor Dr. Johnny J. Boudreaux offers an unblemished view of Gods motives for leaving us here on the earth, and he reminds us that even when life is hard, God never intends to do anything to us that would take away his blessings. Instead, Gods Word shows us that we are responsible for some of the bad in our lives, especially when we allow the devil into our lives. Each chapter in Does God Give a Damn? focuses on those circumstances in our lives that draw us away from God and cause us to falsely accuse him of allowing this confusion, reminding us instead that we must be the ones to stand up to the devil and his tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot blame God for what happens in our lives, but neither can we just say the devil made us do it. First we must admit that our lifestyles and decision-making is what damned our lives. It is not Gods fault, but it is God who offers us the guidance we need to reckon with our sinful ways.&lt;/p&gt;" />
