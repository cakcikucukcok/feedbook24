  <title>Undoing Theology - Chris Greenough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The fundamental issue with ‘queer’ research is it cannot exist in any definable form, as the purpose of queer is to disrupt and disturb. Undoing Doing generates a process of ‘undoing’ as central to queer research enquiries. 
Aiming to engage in a process which breaks free from traditional academic norms, the text explores three life stories: an intersex-identifying Catholic, a former ‘ex-gay’ minister and a Christian who engages in bondage and fetishist practices. 
Employing an ‘undoing’ methodology, which liberates the researcher and allows intuitive, reflective and creative methods, the book makes a significant contribution to the fields of gender, sexuality and queer studies in religion, both empirically and theoretically." />
