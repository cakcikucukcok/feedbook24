  <title>Finally Liberated - Eleanor Stockert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finally Liberated: Through the Reality of Gods Love is a book for all Christians. For new believers, it provides foundation-building materials for establishing a close walk with the Lord. For more mature Christians who may have grown dull of hearing, it provides an opportunity to hear again what drew them to the Lord in the first place. Finally Liberated shows believers how loving and merciful their Heavenly Father is and how very much he wants them to succeed in this life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is a book not only about being blessed but also about being a blessing to others. Through the scriptures, Finally Liberated illustrates how to please the Lord and how to receive the many promises he puts forth in his Word. The many biblical truths discussed will help believers become free by changing the circumstances of their lives through the love and power of God.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is Stockerts prayer that people coming to the altar from all around the world will walk away with a copy of Finally Liberated in their hands and the words of this book will become firmly planted within their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
