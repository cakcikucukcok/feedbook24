Despite the abundance of magazines and self-help books available, people continue to struggle with marriage
Naked and Unashamed describes the diligent, necessary work to maintain marriage, as well holistic character-that the nakedness asked of each individual extends from how we communicate, to how we grow spiritually, to how we manage our finances, and to how we make love.
Every marriage is a snapshot of and testimony to God&#39;s covenant relationship with His Church. Without mincing words, Dr. Jerry, Claudia, and Jeremy offer real help through practical and spiritual advice on these topics and more.

“Naked and Unashamed is a must-read for any couple seeking to do Christian marriage in a way that is glorifying to God. Part master class, part playbook, this frank and easy-to-understand guide is packed with critical insights and practical wisdom that can be applied immediately. This book leaves its readers equipped to engage in their marriage relationship in a truly transformational way. I cannot recommend it highly enough.”

“This is the premarital resource I have been waiting for!
