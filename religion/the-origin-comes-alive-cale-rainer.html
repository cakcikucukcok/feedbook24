  <title>The Origin Comes Alive - Cale Rainer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The sense of life is taken to the limits of extreme perspective in this somewhat technical, yet intimate look into the Human Social Origin. This is an introduction to the existence of a deity that fits the description of what religious organizations call God. A collection of factual and exploratory notes serve as a testament to sharing our sense of origin through perception of reality; a personal experience telling how we connect with a spiritual deity in our younger years, proving that a reality of God replaces belief in God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of brief explanations such as: how humans connect with a deity and why they lose the memory of it; observations of religious ritual methods of worship; how parents should convey the message of the presence of a deity to their children; and questions arise about the future of a society that might take on the direct sense of a deity-origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden meanings of myth and mysticism are replaced by presenting the truth about life in a straightforward, matter-of-fact way that comes across as very real and is something that can be believed as inherent in each one of us. No prophetic statements or unbelievable stories of miracles are present, just straight talk and simple explanations about where we come from and how to recapture the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the content is focused more toward children than adults, it is by no means a children&amp;#39;s book. The primary purpose is to get people, whatever their age or perspective on life, to remember this first sense of life as their origin.&lt;/p&gt;" />
