  <title>A Real Kingdom Is Coming! - Israel Marrone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Kingdom of God is the reign and rule of Gods divine Love for his people, demonstrated by the ultimate sacrifice of his son Jesus Christ for his people. This book backs up these important facts with bible verses to increase your faith in God, Jesus Christ, Christianity and the Church. Thousands have experienced divine health, healing, success and family growth after becoming acquainted with the Power of this Kingdom. You will too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Kingdom of God is.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a supernatural force that operates in its own domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a kingdom of power, not just words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a kingdom whose power and reality can be experienced here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 within you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 empowered by and with the 7 Spirits of God that equipped Jesus and can also equip the believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#149 a futuristic kingdom that will reign and rule here on this earth with Jesus Christ as King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn this and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of God is Gods reign, will, and dominion exercised on earth just as it is in heaven. It demonstrates its influence in the world through the supernatural work of the Holy Ghost as He works through humankind, mainly the born-again believer. The Kingdom can be experienced here and now in lifes everyday circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When and whenever Gods kingdom rules on earth, it is visibly demonstrated with power. Jesus manifested the power of the kingdom with miracles, signs, healing, and deliverance. Each time He announced the good news of the kingdom, sin, sickness, demons, poverty, and death had to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus returned to heaven, He delegated authority to the church, activating it to continue expanding His kingdom in each succeeding generation of believers. The kingdom has everything we need: righteousness, healing, deliverance, prosperity, and joy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
