  <title>The Power of I Believe - Robert Lee Fields</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is based on my writings in the journals I kept over six years. I have always had a strong belief in God.  These writings reflect my spiritual nature.
I wrote this book because many people who have had a stroke do not find the motivation they need during recovery.  Family members do not know what to do for them.  I thought about my own self and how I was motivated during my recovery.  These writings are from my journals that have helped me with my recovery.
I am Author &amp; Motivational Speaker for post-stroke recovery to help and inspire
others and a Small Business Enterprise: 
The Power of I Believe, A book of motivation, encouragement and
inspirational thoughts after a stroke, a Christian-themed book
written to help stroke survivors and others touched by a disability regain
their faith and strength as they recover and move forward with their lives. Though
I wrote this book with stroke survivors in mind, the feedback I have received
through my blog and Facebook page has shown me that The Power of I Believe
is a source of inspiration for anyone who needs it.
Everyone experiences doubt at some pointwhether in themselves or
in Godand this is especially true after a sudden and traumatic event.  I
know from experience. In December 2006 I experienced a sudden stroke, which
left me battling aphasia. As part of my recovery, I returned to the journals I
had kept for many years to find the same inspiration that had motivated me
throughout my life. Through these meditations, I came to understand The
Power of I Believe.
Many people who have a stroke simply do not find the motivation
they need during recovery. And this is not an experience unique to stroke
survivors; anyone struggling with a disability, or even a difficult time in
their life, can find it hard to muster the strength they need.  The
Power of I Believe is written for these people.
The Power of I Believe means making the choice to accomplish your goalsit means having
the determination to keep striving and the faith to know that you will succeed.
In this book, I share the thoughts and the inspirations that gave me the
determination and faith to keep working to overcome my aphasia and recover from
my stroke. My reflections focus on the power of God, the power of faith, and
the power of the mind. Through these inspirational words and thoughts and
through my faith, I found the personal strength preserve. I am now back riding
my bike, playing golf, swimming, and going to the fitness center.
While most books for stroke survivors focus on specific exercises and
tasks that will help a survivor to recover and regain functioning, The Power of
I Believe is focused on instilling the strength and faith necessary during the
recovery process.
