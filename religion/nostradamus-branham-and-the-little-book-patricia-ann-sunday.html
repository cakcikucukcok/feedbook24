  <title>Nostradamus, Branham and the Little Book: - Patricia Ann Sunday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For 457 years the Prophet Nostradamus has been a MYSTERY.  Hidden in dark speech he was misunderstood and rejected by the Protestant Christian Church,  forbidden to be read by the Catholic Church, and totally discredited by psychics and worldly interpreters as being in the Occult.  However, it was the occult interpreters that were instrumental in keeping his work alive and mysterious.  Written from a Christian perspective, many questions about this mysterious man Nostradamus, and why his work has endured so long are answered in this book.  Reverend Sunday has discovered the secrets and the intentions of his lifes work, and you will be amazed to find out WHO Nostradamus really was.  
 If you are curious about Planet X-Wormwood, then you will find out how that ties into these hidden revelations.  There always comes a time when hidden things are revealed to a Prophet.  (Daniel 2:22; Amos 3:7.)
The second Prophet, William Branham, was way ahead of his time in his understanding of supernatural phenomenon; and his revelations on the Book of Genesis regarding the apple and its sexual connotations lost him favor with the approved church then, and now.  Prophets are rarely understood in their own age.  These TWO PROPHETS were brought together to this unknown Sophe/Scribe chosen to disclose the hidden, amazing information, and revelation for our day...To GOD be the GLORY.  Prepare the way for the Lord." />
