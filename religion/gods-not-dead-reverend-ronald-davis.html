  <title>Gods Not Dead - Reverend Ronald Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God is the creator of all life. God is supernatural, a spirit. He created the heavens and earth. Theres nothing hard for God. In this book I show Gods mercy and goodness toward mankind, his love toward us. The Lord has always met his peoples needs, a lot of times supernaturally. All we have to do is believe God and his Word. God can do anything: raise the dead, heal, bless, meet needs whatever they are. We have to understand that God loves us, and wants to bless us. In John 14:12, the Bible says that the works that Jesus did, believers will do also, only they will be greater works because the greater Onethe Holy Spiritlives within us and does them through us, as we yield to him and let him use us. God is looking for people to use in these last days, people who will believe him and his Word. In this book I tell how to get hold of God, and what to do to prepare yourself to be used by him. The Lord has always used peopleit might as well be you. I tell you how, according to the Word of God. God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. &lt;/p&gt;" />
