  <title>The Flight Connection - Mary R. Rodgers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about a day in the life of two lonely people meeting for the very first time. Through a sequence of events they agree to share an abbreviated version of their life testimony for the duration of their flight from Los Angeles to Londonthey are simply drawn to each other. They are amazed at how similar their stories are and how God has worked so wonderfully in each of their lives. They learn that however difficult their lives were God gave them the strength to endure and sent others to help them through things. They realize that it is their responsibility to likewise be available to God to be used to guide and assist others through their lives as well. Life is an opportunity to learn and make appropriate choices as to whom we choose to imitate and learn from. God is in places we least expect him to be, just as Robert Johnson realized halfway through the flight.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that takes these two by surprise is love, a feeling that the emptiness in their lives is being filled. Both immediately shrug it off as fatigue and jet lag, but know in their hearts it is something more. How will they be able to just say goodbye at the end of the flight?&lt;/p&gt;" />
