  <title>Religious Literacy - Stephen Prothero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The United States is one of the most religious places on earth, but it is also a nation of shocking religious illiteracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only 10 percent of American teenagers can name all five major world religions and 15 percent cannot name any.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that the Bible holds the answers to all or most of life&#39;s basic questions, yet only half of American adults can name even one of the four gospels and most Americans cannot name the first book of the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this lack of basic knowledge, politicians and pundits continue to root public policy arguments in religious rhetoric whose meanings are missed&amp;#8212;or misinterpreted&amp;#8212;by the vast majority of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have a major civic problem on our hands,&quot; says religion scholar Stephen Prothero. He makes the provocative case that to remedy this problem, we should return to teaching religion in the public schools. Alongside &quot;reading, writing, and arithmetic,&quot; religion ought to become the &quot;Fourth R&quot; of American education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many believe that America&#39;s descent into religious illiteracy was the doing of activist judges and secularists hell-bent on banishing religion from the public square. Prothero reveals that this is a profound misunderstanding. &quot;In one of the great ironies of American religious history,&quot; Prothero writes, &quot;it was the nation&#39;s most fervent people of faith who steered us down the road to religious illiteracy. Just how that happened is one of the stories this book has to tell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prothero avoids the trap of religious relativism by addressing both the core tenets of the world&#39;s major religions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the real differences among them. Complete with a dictionary of the key beliefs, characters, and stories of Christianity, Islam, and other religions, &lt;em&gt;Religious Literacy&lt;/em&gt; reveals what every American needs to know in order to confront the domestic and foreign challenges facing this country today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
