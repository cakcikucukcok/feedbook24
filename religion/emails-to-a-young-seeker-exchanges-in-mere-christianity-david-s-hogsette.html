  <title>Emails to a Young Seeker: Exchanges in Mere Christianity - David S. Hogsette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As popular advocates for new atheism clash with intellectually gifted Christian apologists, the debates rage on. At the end of the day, after the lecture halls clear and the thumb-worn books are put back on the shelves, the participants in these battles of ideas remain firmly entrenched in their positions. Yet, there are many sincere seekers and committed Christians going about their workaday lives wondering how all of these discussions relate to their own questions and struggles with faith. E-mails to a Young Seeker: Exchanges in Mere Christianity offers a glimpse into how everyday individuals struggle with these heady and relevant questions and debates. Based upon actual e-mail exchanges with sincere seekers, David Hogsette illustrates the importance of grappling with penetrating questions from sincere hearts and thoughtful minds. The questions are real, the concerns run deep, and the desire for reasonable and meaningful answers is clear. This book offers succinct yet comprehensive answers to real-life questions, and it demonstrates that true apologetic evangelism requires a commitment of time and a devotion to relationship.  Drawing from such disciplines as science, philosophy, literature, and biblical studies, E-mails to a Young Seeker provides detailed discussions of many important questions about the existence of God, the reliability of the Bible, and key Christian doctrines such as sin, heaven, hell, the Trinity, Christ&#39;s sacrificial and atoning death, the resurrection, and salvation through faith in Christ alone. Readers, be they seekers in search of answers or Christians wanting to strengthen their faith or develop strategies for sharing their faith with others, will greatly benefit from these discussions and the extensive reading lists provided at the end of the exchanges." />
