  <title>Selfless in a Selfie World - Codi Gandee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In contrast to a world that pushes you to promote yourself above all others, the doctrine of Christ teaches humility. Followers of Jesus are taught to be reverent to a sovereign God, to exalt one another, and to be servants to those around them. Not only does God delight in His peoples humility, but He will bless them for it.
Because where could pride get you? 
In the middle of a field, roaming around with mental issues for seven years, if youre like King Nebuchadnezzar. 
You see, Daniel had interpreted a dream of despair to the king. He told him that he would hit rock bottom and stay there until he realized that the magnificence of his kingdom was from God and not himself. 
Eight years later, King Nebuchadnezzar was standing in the middle of a field, looking and acting like a wild man when he acknowledged Gods presence in his life, in his success. It wasnt until after this proclamation of praise and honor to our King that he was given back his kingdom. 
I encourage you to learn from King Nebuchadnezzar and give God glory now so that you wont have to be reminded that He is the one that is worthy of all your praise. 
Because the proud will be humbled, and the humble will be honored." />
