  <title>Secrets of the Blessed - C. A. Lemaster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No one ever promised life had to be fair, but does it have to hurt so much? Is there any hope that this pain will ever end? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever Jesus went, he was surrounded by a multitude of hurting peoplefolks that needed someone to care about and for them. He saw them as harassed, scattered sheep in desperate need of a shepherd. To each of us, he has brought hope for deliverance, healing from our sorrows, and forgiveness for our sins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we investigate the heartbeat of the Psalmists, the trials of the patriarchs, or the pains of the apostles, we find people who faced the abuse life arbitrarily hurls our way. These saints found healing through their relationship with their God. They wrote fearlessly of their experiences so we might learn from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secrets of the Blessed takes us on a journey of faith through our pain. There is truly hope for a blessed, happy life when we learn to believe God even when he seems unfair to us. There really are no secrets, but there are nuggets of wisdom we can mine from Gods Word.&lt;/p&gt;" />
