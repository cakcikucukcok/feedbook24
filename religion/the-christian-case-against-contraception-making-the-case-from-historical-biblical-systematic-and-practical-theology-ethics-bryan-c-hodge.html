  <title>The Christian Case against Contraception: Making the Case from Historical, Biblical, Systematic, and Practical Theology &amp; Ethics - Bryan C. Hodge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evangelicals often give little thought to the morality of contraception, but when they do, serious studies of the subject are scarce if not non-existent. The Christian Case against Contraception seeks to fill this gap by evaluating the practice, not from personal preference or mere experience, but from the four major theological disciplines of Christianity: Historical, Biblical, Systematic, and Practical Theology and Ethics.  The book begins with a contrastive analysis between secular and ecclesiastical culture and thought concerning the subject of contraception and the purpose of the sexual act. The claims of the Church, that contraception is morally unacceptable, is examined further as the book takes the reader on a journey through biblical, systematic, and practical arguments which establish the foundations of the Historic Church&#39;s claim.  Opposing arguments are evaluated as to their strength and validity. In fact, Hodge stirs the debate with a challenge that he has yet to see Christians set forth a valid biblical argument in support of contraceptive practices.  For the reader seeking to place procreative ethics under the lordship of Christ, The Christian Case against Contraception offers a bold and clear way forward." />

    	<p>Evangelicals often give little thought to the morality of contraception, but when they do, serious studies of the subject are scarce if not non-existent. The Christian Case against Contraception seeks to fill this gap by evaluating the practice, not from personal preference or mere experience, but from the four major theological disciplines of Christianity: Historical, Biblical, Systematic, and Practical Theology and Ethics. The book begins with a contrastive analysis between secular and ecclesiastical culture and thought concerning the subject of contraception and the purpose of the sexual act. The claims of the Church, that contraception is morally unacceptable, is examined further as the book takes the reader on a journey through biblical, systematic, and practical arguments which establish the foundations of the Historic Church's claim. Opposing arguments are evaluated as to their strength and validity. In fact, Hodge stirs the debate with a challenge that he has yet to see Christians set forth a valid biblical argument in support of contraceptive practices.
