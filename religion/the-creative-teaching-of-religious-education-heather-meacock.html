  <title>The Creative Teaching of Religious Education: - Heather Meacock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is based on the vision that religious education (RE) can be taught creatively, with relevance to the lives of teachers and their pupils today, in predominantly secular society. RE should be taught from the perspective of knowledge and understanding of religions, to foster tolerance and to dispel prejudice and misunderstanding, without any attempt to influence childrens personal beliefs. The philosophy which underpins this book is the belief that RE is best taught within an integrated approach to the humanities. The humanities are about what it is to be human, in time and place and in terms of belief. Therefore, RE is linked with history, geography, and the creative arts within five themes: human survival, light and dark, leadership, the environment, and time and motion. As well, there is accurate and detailed subject knowledge about the six major world faiths and plays/scenes about them written and produced in schools by myself. 
The book is in alignment with the British National Curriculum, which requires that RE is taught in schools, and with the latest Ofsted Report (2010), which states that there is a need for guidance for teachers, and more creative and innovative approaches to link RE with the wider curriculum." />
