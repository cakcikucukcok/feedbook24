  <title>Yeshua - Mary Ognan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most women will be able to relate to Faith, the main character in this story. She had only dreamt about the life she was now living. She thought she had a handle on it, planning for her wedding and carrying out the work that God had clearly given her to do. But the meeting with her employers changed everything. They placed even more demands on her than she all ready had. How could she possibly find the time to do it all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith now had to make an impossible choice between the love of her life and her God-given career. Was this the Lords way of telling her that he had closed the door on this chapter of her career and had opened another? She has to search deep into her soul to find the answers. Her world is coming apart. She cries out, Lord, is there a workable solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Michael had many sleepless nights of his own, wrestling with his past. When he confesses his past to the congregation, will they accept or reject him? And how will the new woman in his life react when she hears what his life was like five years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
