  <title>The Chosen . . . for Such a Time Like This - Uwemedimo Ekaette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Underlay Gods purposes and programs throughout all the ages is to bring to a climax the full Salvation of man, which is having the fallen man recreated or regenerated and growing up into perfection in the image of Him who created Him or having man attain the full measure of the stature of Christ, who is the express image of God. In this realm of life, sickness, poverty, sorrow, and pains are no more, and death is completely abolished. This is Eden, this is paradise, and this is the kingdom of God where righteousness dwells. This realm is attainable now! I know you wouldnt want to miss out on this. 
Consequently, the curtain is ready to be drawn up; all things are ready, and God is now set to unveil His Sons. To this end, God is restoring the Sonship message and the reality of the establishment of the kingdom of God upon the earth. This gospel seems to have been lost and put aside for over a century now. God is causing as many as are ordained or predestined for this to enter into this realm of life. This is the fullness of the spirit.
In this book, the author, in prophetic undertones, unravels the mystery of the coming salvation by the Elect and Chosen ones, who are the manifestation of the Sons of God at this close of the church age, to the intent that those whom God apprehends may be fully apprehended and persuaded to know the exceeding riches of His grace towards us whom He has Chosen in love before the foundation of the world to the praise of His glory and to know the exceeding greatness of His power that is available to us, in us and through us, whom He has Chosen, and to display the manifold or many-sided wisdom of God unto the principalities and powers by the Church in this age and that which is to come. 
This book is very timely. Be warned! This book is revolutionary. It will upturn your conventional religious worldview and beliefs and set you ablaze on fire and holy desire to lay hold of the fullness of God in Christ. Above all, it promises to be a blessing to all who read it and give heed to the words of this prophecy.
