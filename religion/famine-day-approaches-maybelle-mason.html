  <title>Famine Day Approaches - Maybelle Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FAMINE DAY APPROACHES demonstrates how the author has successfully dealt with the obstacles, and needs in her life during many years of experiences. Travel with her as she learned to define the need of patience from defeatism, a lack of communication from a lack of faith, accepting wise discernment when she was emotionally disturbed, and knowing the inspiration given by God from her own conflicting interpretations. The author depicts how she learned to differentiate between the approaches which endorse Christian values and common-sense ethics from the approaches that can bring about a reproach of disgrace and shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to revealing the authors personal problems and triumphs, FAMINE DAY APPROACHES consists of sixty-plus fictional short stories, described as paintings. It, also, discloses the remarkable experience that initiated her depictions of human nature in writing. The narratives are descriptive, dialogical problems which are solved with good definitive, principled solutions. Her years of experiences add dynamisms to the variety of mindsets referencing potentials of human nature.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to become keenly aware of the many charted, and honorable privileges available when a personal famine occurs in ones own life. Discover how famine day abundances can offset the famine day scarcities with surprised amazement. Although a shortage of Godly discernment is prevalent in todays world, it need not be. Besides having access to the Holy Scriptures a well-stocked warehouse of famine day bread is identifiable within this work which closely relates to an eminent masterpiece which ardently addresses the same subjects.&lt;/p&gt;" />
