  <title>Dealing with the Four Horns - Rev. Francis Eddyson Unankah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After God created man, He blessed man and gave him a commission, And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: have dominion over the fish of the sea and, over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth (Genesis 1:28).
Gods wish for us is to increase and multiply, but Satan wants to stop that very mandate. This was demonstrated in Exodus 1:10, when a new pharaoh rose up in Egypt and called his people to come and deal wisely with the people of Israel so as to stop them from increasing and multiplying. Egypt is a type of world; Pharaoh, a type of Satan and Israel, a type of church (children of God). The result of the call by Pharaoh was appointment of task masters over Gods people to afflict them and make their lives bitter. The task masters are types of evil horns discussed in this book. They make sure that no one is able to lift up his head. The strongman holds riches to make people to struggle, household enemies enforce bondage, curses and infirmity enforce oppression so that people do not fulfil their God-given mandate. This book is set out to address this horns and how believers can deal with them and be able to lift up their heads." />
