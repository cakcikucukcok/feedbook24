  <title>You Are Never Alone! - Stanley B. Mathurin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does your life seem to be empty, without meaning and/or purpose?
Is the intense feeling of emptiness driving you into substance abuse, alcohol or promiscuous activities?
Do you feel abandoned, because family and friends have distanced themselves from you?
Maybe your testimony as a Christian has opened the flood gates of satan to drown the life out of you and you just dont feel you can make it any more, because its too much for you to bear.  Well, listen to this.  The God that I serve, His name is Jehovah.  He is greater than the adversity you are facing.  You are not alone!
	From a divine perspective, I say this to you:  Fight the good fight of faith!  Hold on to the faithfulness of Gods Word and endure difficulties without wavering.  And then, according to 1 Peter 5:10, may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen and settle you.  Glory to God!!!  YOU ARE NOT ALONE!
	God will transform your loneliness into infinite happiness.  No amount of friends, social gatherings, family get-togethers, movies, sports or lovers can ever fill the inner void from which loneliness originates.  Only God can.  When all our entertainments and busy-ness fail us, its time to look outside ourselves to our heavenly Father, Jehovah.  
Because He lives, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY NEVER ALONE!" />
