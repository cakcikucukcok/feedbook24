  <title>Day-To-Day with Kimberella and Prince Ain&#39;t-So-Charmin&#39; - Kimberly A. Weires</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kimberella and Prince Roderick try to live a normal day-to-day life in Dubuque, Iowa, but sometimes they fail to do so (quite often, but whos keeping track.) Prince Roderick grew up in the country, learned how to build houses, played in a family band since age eleven, hunted, fished and explored the outdoors. Kimberella lived in the city, took piano lessons, baked, knitted and never quite grew up. As husband and wife they manage to compromise by building two houses, playing in bands and living in Kimberellas childhood home in the city. They also go hunting, fishing and camping together. They raised a son and daughter who are both married with each having children of their own. Their dog, Fudgy, is the master of the house. Witty Kitty is a smart cat that makes appearances whenever the mood strikes him. Jack and The Old Folk Band consists of themselves along with their son and D.J. They will play your special request, you just may not recognize it as such. One thing all of the characters have in common is that they are God-loving Christians who go about their lives the best way they can, using Gods Holy Bible as their guide. Kimberella hopes that after reading this book every day for a year, and hopefully for many years to come, you will pick up your Bible and read it to receive Gods message for you to get through any situation that may arise. This is the third book of the devotional series Day-To-Day with Kimberella and Prince Aint-So-Charmin. Weires recently published (If the Shoe Fits..Run!) in 2014 and (Still Havin a Ball!) in 2015. Quite a few stories are based on actual experiences. The Bible always has a verse or two to go along with any activity the Buckskins find themselves in." />
