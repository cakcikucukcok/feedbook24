  <title>Crossruption - Jacob William</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Do you constantly ask, Is there something more to life than this?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Do you...&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Pray to your God? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Attend services to worship? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Read the scriptures? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Meet with fellow believers? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Believe in an after-life? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Listen to teaching? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Give your money? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Express your faith? ?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;But even with all the spiritual boxes checked, is something still not right?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Is something still missing?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The answer to lifes elusive questions is what Crossruption is all about.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;A brief scan of this book might create the assumption that the author is a professor of religion or theologian. But here is where the anomaly begins. Jacob William is the President and Group CEO of an international Information Technology business. Founded in 2002, the company now has over 9,000 clients and 2000 employees with a global footprint.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;So with these credentials, why write a book on spirituality?&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Jacob experienced both sides of life, from financial crisis to incredible success, insignificance to influence, the depths of self-destruction to the heights of affluence. Jacobs life represents achievement of the quintessential American dream! But in the midst of all his accomplishments he experienced an inner emptiness that he calls the cosmic vacuum. Jacob realized he was desperately trying to fill this void with the possessions and achievements of life.&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;There is a transformational journey awaiting us where we are transformed into a new creation to live in spiritual communion, communication, and companionship with God, resulting in the lifestyle of Jesuslove in the midst of hate, peace in the midst of war, unity in the midst of divisive discrimination. Living the supernatural life, naturally!&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Crossruption, as he came to call his spiritual journey, takes up where Jacobs success story leaves off... an invitation to experience the ultimate disruption of life!&lt;br\&gt;" />
