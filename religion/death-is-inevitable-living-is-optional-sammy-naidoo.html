  <title>Death Is Inevitable - Living Is Optional! - Sammy Naidoo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Death and suffering are inevitable parts of life.Some die young, making death seem senseless and cruel. Why would a good God inflict such suffering amidst the cries for help and a miracle? Even the cries of the faithful followers of Jesus are ignored. Is He real?
This book is about my personal journey with cancer patients and their families. It is about understanding Gods great end-time plan and believing that He had us on His mind for an eternal purpose.This purpose was uniquely woven through the intricacies of lifes challenges by the Masters hand; to develop the mind and character of Christ, ultimately for His Glory and reconciliation with Him in Heaven. Death is not to be feared.
Pain and death serve a purpose. Many lives are transformed. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).
When you open your heart to His love and healing, pain will turn into ministry.
