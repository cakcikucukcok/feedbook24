  <title>From Seed to Sapling - Adam Sterenberg, Adam Sterenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What youll find inside this book is a collection of stories giving glory to God for His vision to start a Christ-centered school in the Edison neighborhood. This neighborhood of ten thousand people is the poorest, most diverse, most crime-ridden in its county. But a great source of hope started in 2010 at the new elementary school called Tree of Life. Although they started with twelve students in rented classrooms, within three years, they have grown to fifty students in a brand-new state-of-the-art facility. Learn of one miracle after another and Gods love for the children and families at Tree of Life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I want a Christian school in the inner city of Kalamazoo, and I want it to be affordable to anyone. God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Lord spoke these words to me in 2003, I had no idea how my life and thousands of others would be changed forever. As the founder of Tree of Life School, God has taken me and many others on a wild journey that has intense highs and lows. Through the pages of this book, I want to share some miraculous things that God is doing in and through Tree of Life School.&lt;/p&gt;" />
