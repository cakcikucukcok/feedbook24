  <title>Being With God - Ruth Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The secret&amp;rsquo;s out&amp;mdash;finally a genuine nuts-and-bolts book on &amp;lsquo;how to&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;communicate with God just as we are. All myths have been absolved in this&amp;nbsp;soul-rending &amp;lsquo;at-one-ment with God&amp;rsquo; dialogue Ruth has written here. How&amp;nbsp;do we find God, let-alone talk to God? God&amp;rsquo;s communication with us&amp;mdash;how&amp;nbsp;do we recognise God&amp;rsquo;s voice; how do we hear God? How do we keep an ongoing&amp;nbsp;conversation with God? Whether one is searching or is already on&amp;nbsp;the journey, Ruth&amp;rsquo;s book gives each and every one of us the assurance that&amp;nbsp;absolutely everyone is unconditionally loved by a God who really wants to&amp;nbsp;be at one with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between always asking a person for something, yes,&amp;nbsp;that is talking to the person. However, the difference between that and&amp;nbsp;conversing with someone is quite different. A conversation is the to-ing and fro-ing of a growing discourse. BEING WITH GOD is a book of God and&amp;nbsp;Ruth&amp;rsquo;s conversations&amp;mdash;a two-way conversation between them both. She has&amp;nbsp;faithfully, at God&amp;rsquo;s bidding, recorded for our benefi t many of them in this&amp;nbsp;book. They are insightful into a personal life of faith rarely described in such&amp;nbsp;raw honesty and for the reader they are a gift. The manner in which they&amp;nbsp;have been related is wonderfully instructive, helpful and of much benefit&amp;nbsp;for everyone. The simplicity of the writing, the simplicity demonstrated of&amp;nbsp;us approaching God as being a part of our everyday life and the simplicity&amp;nbsp;of our listening to God&amp;rsquo;s voice in our &amp;lsquo;at-one-ment&amp;rsquo; with God, when reading&amp;nbsp;BEING WITH GOD illustrates the fullness of how we can have a continual&amp;nbsp;growing relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every life is individual. Ruth speaks of the things in her life, individual to her&amp;nbsp;alone, and of how she is aware that in and through those happenings, there&amp;nbsp;are insights for her in her continuing conversation with God. BEING WITH&amp;nbsp;GOD shows how our lives can be enlivened as though a third dimension&amp;nbsp;has opened to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is one which is long overdue in its helpfulness. -JAN HARVEY&lt;/p&gt;" />
