  <title>Forever Eric - Sandra Leah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Im just an ordinary person who grew up in a simple life on a farm. As my life unfolded, I had no idea what was going to happen. Suddenly, my twenty-one-year-old son, Eric, was diagnosed with a rare, terminal cancer and was given two years to live. At the same time, my husband wanted a divorcejust six months after wed relocated to Florida from Wisconsin, away from my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was raised with Christian values, I surrendered to God for help. I was scared and alone, and I let God lead me. I was taken on a journey guided by many people who came into my life and my sons life. One of the greatest blessings was a special woman, Elizabeth, who came into my life to help me regain my spiritual life. Friends and good Samaritans also helped me through this confusing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric was also given blessings as he gave his life to the University of Wisconsin Cancer Research Department, hoping to help find a cure for cancer. As he was going through cancer research treatments, he continued his artwork. Some of the greatest gifts to him were the music and letters of hope from Jimmy Buffet, which filled Erics months with the strength to never give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This special colored edition features some of the gifted artwork that Eric gave to his family and friends before he passed away. They will now be enjoyed forever. You will also learn about what else he gave us during his short life. Come along with me, Eric, and my daughter, Lisa, as we find our way through the two-and-a-half-year journey before Eric passed away.&lt;/p&gt;" />
