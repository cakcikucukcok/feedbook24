  <title>You Are Free Study Guide - Rebekah Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this six session video Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately), Rebekah Lyons explores why we all want to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, what we were made for. Yet many of us believe that &amp;ldquo;calling&amp;rdquo; feels like something held for the exclusive few. Rebekah&amp;rsquo;s heart is to dismantle that idea, to remind each and every one of us that God has plans for something specific if we have ears to hear the still small voice of a Father that beckons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we pressed into finding our truest selves hidden below the surface?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebekah has traveled the country sharing with vulnerability her own pain and struggles to hear God and follow Him. &amp;ldquo;I have prayed with hands laid for healing and deliverance on women considering suicide, experiencing trauma, fighting cancer, holding off divorce, overcoming addiction and more. These are women, battle weary and wounded saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m done with the life I&amp;rsquo;ve created. I hunger for all that God promises. I want to expect more from a passionate and relentless God. I cannot continue to operate from a place of wounding. Please set me free.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is risk in this journey. We cannot get ahead of ourselves and just end up with a prettier version of striving. Rebekah reminds viewers that without healing from God along the way we can be pulled back into a place of wounding and bondage. But abiding in God&amp;rsquo;s presence will bring us answers and inform and sustain our calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebekah&amp;rsquo;s voice is a vulnerable, prophetic call for women to become who they&amp;rsquo;ve already been designed to be. She is answering the questions women are asking. Listen to hear how we truly run&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for use with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;You Are Free&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;DVD (sold separately).&lt;/p&gt;" />
