  <title>Born Again – What It Really Means - Dr. Jan Burke Gallamore, Dr. Larry Gallamore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about what it really means to be born again. To many people, the term born again means a one-time Christian experience of accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior. However, we argue that being born again has a broader meaning, including learning how to really live every day of our lives. Todays world is at a critical juncture. In the past few years, we have witnessed a global economy that is out of control. Governments spend more than they have, people are losing their homes to foreclosure, businesses close because they are unable to pay their employees, and people are out of work and search for months to find a job, which often barely pays them a living wage. They lose their self-esteem and motivation to even look for work. 
Our whole nation and world is in need of being born again, but not just in a religious sense. The teachings of Jesus and other spiritual leaders tell us that we are individually responsible for our lives. The answers to all lifes problems are found within ourselves. The kingdom of God is within. This means that there is a spark of the divine found within each person. To be truly born again means to live in harmony with the laws of the universe.  We must take responsibility for our own thoughts, attitudes, and actions. Utilizing the teachings of great spiritual teachers, we will focus on building each other up and the destructive values such as greed, power, control, and jealousy will be transformed into values of love, cooperation, understanding, and compassion. This is the real meaning of being born again." />
