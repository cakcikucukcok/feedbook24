  <title>A “Must Read” Divine Revelation of the Life History of Mary and Jesus - Joseph N. Sama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The precious life history of Mary and her divine Son, Jesus, is full of striking
revelations. It reveals how angels were created as lights (angelic lights), why
and how the angelic battle was fought in heaven, and links both Jesus and Mary
to the fall of proud Lucifer, who refused the authority of Christ and his Mother.
Also revealed and described in detail are:
 the Immaculate Conception and birth of Mary,
 the powers given her over the universe before the Annunciation,
 the mysterious birth of Jesus,
 the flight to Egypt and what happened there,
 the Holy Family before Saint Josephs death, how Lucifers powers
were clipped each time he failed in his attacks on Mary,
 the unbreakable ties between Jesus and Mary, and Marys latent role
in our salvation,
 Jesus bitter suffering and death, his Resurrection and his Ascension
into heaven,
 Marys life after the Ascension of Jesus, how Mary protected and
guided the apostles and the Church and how she oversaw the writing
of the Gospels and Apostles Creed,
 the holy transition (death) of Mary, her Resurrection and
Assumption into heaven after three days, and her subsequent
role as dispenser of all Gods graces even to those who ignore and
blaspheme Her, and how, no one gets to the Father except through
Christ and no one gets to Christ except through Mary, who brought
Jesus to us and now brings us to Jesus." />
