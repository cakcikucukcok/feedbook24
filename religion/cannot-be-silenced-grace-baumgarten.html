  <title>Cannot Be Silenced - Grace Baumgarten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you know? Theres a battle, raging for over 6,000 years and continuing until the end of time? Beginning in the Garden of Eden, between God and Lucifer, truth and falsehood, good and evil, light and darkness. A battle for the souls of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created man to multiply, subdue, and have dominion over the earth. But Lucifer, or Satan, the ruler of the world system, was envious of Gods love for man. He deceived Adam and Eve to sin against God. Ever since then, Satan has ensnared various men across time, advancing his agenda; to create world-wide financial dominion, thus controlling the political, spiritual and economic systems everywhere, with himself taking full lordship over Gods creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I, Grace Baumgarten, Cannot Be Silenced. With this being an election year in the USA, and its consequent Changing of the guard, being informed about the secret societies, or Enlightened Elites, is imperative. Their ideology? True freedom is liberation from God, and from moral constraints; with no absolute faith. To them, All truth is relative to the individual or group. With back-room dealings, ruinous bailouts and elimination of basic human values, theyve turned the USA over to be dissected, corporate-style, and theyre forcing this fraud on you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, our founding fathers constructed a different concept; one of freedom, under the authority of Almighty God, as the Great Ruler; with His creation, nations and peoples empowered from on High, His Bible and His Commandments are the authoritative Word of God, and the basis for law, life, and true liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first book was just the beginning, and so much has happened! Therefore, following a one-year sabbatical, I started writing one sentence at a time, knowing one day, this book would be born. I Cannot Be Silenced.&lt;/p&gt;" />
