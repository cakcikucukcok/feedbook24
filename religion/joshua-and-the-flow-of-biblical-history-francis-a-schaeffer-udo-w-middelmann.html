  <title>Joshua and the Flow of Biblical History - Francis A. Schaeffer, Udo W. Middelmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book of Joshua brings to life real history during the crucial period of transition for the Israelites as they follow God&#39;s direction and settle in the promised land. Israel needed discipline in light of their newfound freedom. They faced the responsibility of living as a covenant people while adapting to change. Joshua describes the historic shift from the revelation of God&#39;s promises to their realization. God&#39;s care of his people becomes obvious, and their struggle with disobedience, selfishness, and fear is very human.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Francis Schaeffer&#39;s thoughts on the book of Joshua show readers the historic, spiritual, and intellectual nourishment available for the Christian life through the examples of Joshua and his fellow Israelites. In the book of Joshua, Schaeffer finds that God reveals his sorrow over human sin, as well as his gracious love for his people. This is as true for us as it was for those in Joshua&#39;s time. This study of the settling of Israel will inspire readers to see the hand of God present in all of history, including today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
