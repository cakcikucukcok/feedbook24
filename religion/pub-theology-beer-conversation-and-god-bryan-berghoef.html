  <title>Pub Theology: Beer, Conversation, and God - Bryan Berghoef</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From London to New York to Ann Arbor, people are gathering in pubs and bars to communicate, connect, and learn from one another over the topic of religion, of all things. In Pub Theology, pastor, writer, and pub theologian Bryan Berghoef draws from his own experience in one such setting in northern Michigan. Berghoef contends that for too long the church has insisted on setting the terms for how one can find and encounter God. Yet what if God is to be found in places we haven&#39;t been looking at all: in a coworker who doesn&#39;t believe in God, in a Buddhist neighbor, in a friend who prefers a yoga studio to a sanctuary?  This book will move readers to shift toward a more chastened, humble, and inviting faith. A faith that seeks not to teach, but to learn; not to speak, but to listen. A faith that will have a seat at the table in the important religious conversations our world is having.  Real-life stories gleaned from conversations and encounters during pub theology gatherings, combined with the author&#39;s own experience in grappling with these issues, make for an intriguing and enlightening read.  So what are you waiting for? Pull up a chair and join the conversation!" />
