  <title>Learn of Me - Pastor L. Fitzjerald Townsend Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christianity and the learning of Jesus is by far the most simplistic of all religions for bringing one to a saving faith.  However, man has once again managed to complicate the simplicity of the gospel.
Many who are not of the Christian faith and desire to learn are at times intimidated by the many different denominations and doctrines which appear to be within the Christian church.
Pastor Townsend, although somewhat of a theologian himself, possesses the unique ability of taking mentally demanding theological concepts and transforming them into easy to understand everyday language.
After reading this book you will be inspired to place your faith and trust in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior without the entanglement of religious and theological mental gymnastics.
In this book you will learn:
?	Revelation Knowledge The Gift that Must Be Given
?	The Holy Trinity When You See One You See Them All
?	Works vs.- Righteousness The Pathway for Entering His Rest&quot;
?	Getting Yoked-Up with Jesus The Importance of Finding Rest In Relationship with Christ
?	How To Be Saved Today" />
