  <title>Dating Is Sin! - Jack Youngblood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are Christians who are dating being led astray into ungodly, and  sinful marriages? Should pastors preach that dating is sin? Finding God ordained love is not meant to be &quot;casual&quot;; it&#39;s meant to be a &quot;covenant relationship&quot;- looking only for that special person God has set aside for you. It is not meant to be a guessing game based on one&#39;s feelings.  There&#39;s a Biblical path to God ordained love, and a way to know exactly who you  should marry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dating Is Sin! Breaking God&#39;s Heart can help you avoid the heartaches, and disastrous pitfalls of sin most people go through in dating and marriage.
Making one sacrifice after another, trying to fix a lackluster relationship can leave you: tired, bitter, confused, and ready to give up! Don&#39;t let it happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, obedience to God, will not hurt you, but will protect your heart, your emotions, and your spiritual relationship with the Heavenly Father. 
God ordained love will never leave you in a vicious circle of sin, via the world&#39;s idea of romance: dating, marriage, divorce - dating, marriage, divorce. It is not a list of rules, but a lifestyle to keep your body and your heart right with God. Be patient, wait on the Lord . . . trust in Him!&lt;/p&gt;" />
