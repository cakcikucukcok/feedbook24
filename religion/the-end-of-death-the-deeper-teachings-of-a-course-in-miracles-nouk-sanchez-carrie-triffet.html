  <title>The End of Death: The Deeper Teachings of A Course in Miracles - Nouk Sanchez, Carrie Triffet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t trust God.&lt;/strong&gt; We may think we do! But when we dare to look deeply into our own unconscious mind, we&amp;rsquo;ll be shocked to learn what we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; believe about God&amp;mdash;and thus, about Self and world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of Death &amp;ndash; Volume One: The Development of Trust &lt;/em&gt;is a clear and uncompromising beacon that illuminates our current predicament, as well as the steps required in our journey home to God.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;A Course in Miracles&lt;/em&gt; as its treasure map, &lt;em&gt;The End of Death&lt;/em&gt; carves a brilliantly clear and insightful path straight toward the treasure of Christed awareness. With startlingly lucid explanations, Nouk pares the &lt;em&gt;Course&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s true message down to its most powerful essence. And the many &lt;em&gt;Course&lt;/em&gt; quotes she includes offer undeniable proof of the argument she makes: That Jesus asks every one of us to embody full Christed awareness -- &lt;em&gt;right here, right now, while still in a body &lt;/em&gt;-- just as He did.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Included with this book: Powerful additional support in the form of diagrams, exercises, prayers and guided audio meditations downloadable from the End of Death website.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I cannot express the profound gratitude I feel for this book. Jeshua [guided me to] this quote from Paul Tuttle&amp;rsquo;s book Graduation: The End of Illusions:&amp;lsquo;There are five major books of the modern world which address the divinity of man and facilitate his realization of Reality&amp;mdash;his Awakening. The first is Science and Health by Mary Baker Eddy. The second is The Urantia Book. The third is A Course In Miracles. The fourth is Graduation: The End of Illusions. And the fifth is yet to appear.&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Nouk, The End of Death is number 5!&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;~ John Mark Stroud, founder of One Who Wakes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The End of Death is a powerful testimony of Nouk Sanchez&amp;rsquo; own miraculous shift from confusion and grief to aliveness, joy and certainty as she began to truly live the principles of A Course in Miracles. She invites the reader to take the teachings of Jesus literally&amp;mdash;and take them for a test drive. This is a must-read for anyone who is ready to get off the merry-go-round of [endless] seeking. It is for anyone who thinks awakening is just around the corner. It&amp;#39;s not around the corner ... it&amp;#39;s now.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;~ Lisa Natoli, author of Gorgeous for God; founder of Teachers of God&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Forgiveness is to be lived and experienced, far beyond theology or intellectual understanding.&amp;nbsp; In The End of Death, Nouk takes [us on] the authentic inward journey into the Living experience of Christ.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;~ David Hoffmeister, founder of Foundation of Awakening Mind&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Even after 30 years as a Course student and teacher, after reading The End of Death I have experienced many new shifts in consciousness. [This is} an inspirational, enlightening and life-changing experience. My gratitude overflows!&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;~ Rev. Myron Jones, author of Hey, Holy Spirit, It&amp;#39;s Me Again&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I sense such a thirst in the ACIM community to move from head to heart, and from intellect alone to Higher Mind. [As Jeshua teaches] &amp;lsquo;ONLY in the midst of the dream you made&amp;mdash;including the body &amp;mdash;can you truly realize Christ.&amp;rsquo; The End of Death will help many to do just that.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;~ Jayem, channel for The Way of Mastery series: Teachings from Jeshua&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Grounded in her own experience and a solid grasp of Course metaphysics, Nouk lays out a well-lit path for us to [follow]. The End of Death is a wonderful invitation to heal at the deepest levels of the psyche.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;~ Kenneth Bok, founder of&amp;nbsp;ACIM Explained&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;" />
