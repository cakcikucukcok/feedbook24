  <title>Strong in the Spirit - Mark Foley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine standing in the face of adversity, unmoved by your fears and doubts, ready to respond to any spiritual attack. Imagine trusting and hoping in God so deeply that nothing is impossible. Imagine having such great strength of character that the Enemy of your soul fears you.
Our Heavenly Father is endeavoring to make us strong in the power of his Spirit, but just like weight training and fitness, its not always easy. Physical fitnessjust like spiritual fitnessis a process that takes a lot of hard work.
God has a way of training us, and when we understand his ways we become stronger through every difficulty we encounter.
Have you ever felt like God has let you down, that others have gotten away with hurting you, or that youve stepped out in faith only to fail? God wants to strengthen us through the trials of life like he did Peter, Joseph, King David, and others.
Spiritual truths and insights come to us as we dig through the Scriptures to understand Gods way of strengthening us. Lets seek to understand this process and allow God to make us strong in the Spirit.
Theres nothing like having a personal trainer to help your body reach its full potential. Consider this book your spiritual personal trainer, helping you reach your full potential and become the person God intended you to be, living from a place of strength, faith, and trust. God wants to build spiritual strength in us, and he knows just how to do it!" />
