  <title>Psalms of Bliss - Edwin A. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Psalms of Bliss is a journey, a walk through the lives of the authors ancestors before him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Author, Edwin A. Hill believes that by looking back, there is often revelation for life today. He states that .the lives and life experiences of our ancestors have shaped much of who we are and who we can be, if we choose to understand the roads they have trodden. He is saddened for our youth today, who have little knowledge of the beliefs held by their ancestors as role models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book draws us to the authors ancestors that trace back for over 100 years. Love from God offers access to a life in heaven as key to the Bliss, the joy shared generation to generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms of Bliss affirms the blessings waiting for all of our lives as we receive Gods gift of new life in our hearts. New life that many of our ancestors embraced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stories, psalms and poems, he invites us into his heart to choose to join him in praises to God. Hills chapters and psalms are full of compassion, joy, faith, fears and even Bliss resulting from Gods blessings upon this family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms of Bliss encourages us to rejoice with family and others from gracious hearts standing strong in the favor of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
