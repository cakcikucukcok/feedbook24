  <title>Dear Lord I&#39;ve Often Wondered - Janice F. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our journey through life is filled with the unexpected. We encounter unexpected joy, sorrow, trouble and pain. These are the experiences that shape us and make us the unique individuals we are today. We all struggle with our own personal demons, even though they may seem strange or insignificant to others. Pain is always lonely, whether physical, mental, emotional or spiritual, and no one except our Creator can fully understand. As we face the challenges of life, we come face to face with the need for something or someone greater than ourselves to sustain, guide and comfort us. Only when we fall before our mighty Creator and begin to comprehend his incredible power, love, and forgiveness, do we find what is missing and the huge hole in our heart and soul is filled. In this book we look into Jans heart and share some of the pain and joy of her journey. It is her prayer that you, the reader, will see that our Heavenly Father is waiting with open arms to meet your every need as only He can. Even when we are not aware of His presences, or maybe dont even care, He is patiently waiting, seeking us and pulling us back to Him." />
