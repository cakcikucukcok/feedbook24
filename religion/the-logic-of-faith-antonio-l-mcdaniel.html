  <title>The Logic of Faith - Antonio L. McDaniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Behold, I give you faith! Now, you have the ability to move and live and breathe in confidence; that everything you touch will work; all that you think about will become a positive influence and change lives; you will even become wealthy in the process. It would be absolutely wonderful for God to make that pronouncement to us and it becomes so. Fortunately and to what may be the ultimate paradox, the kind of faith we seek will only come by trials, perseverance, and yes, it is a journey that we all must take. Faith increases as it is used and grows exponentially when it is tested. The true depth of these &quot;tests of faith&quot; does not come because you decide to seek or pursue God more; these tests come because &quot;faith&quot; is alive and demands to be fed, even challenged. Admittedly, faith does appear to be somewhat illogical, but most goals or feats of greatness are often met with resistance; in the end, when the goal has been met, the feat obtained and the journey completed, it is only then, in clear hindsight that you realize that this was a test of your faith; subsequently, as you reflect on your travels, you think about all the things that you would have changed or done differently, only to later realize that if things were different you may not be who you are. The Logic of Faith is a reasonable a step along the path of your journey; through personal experiences, some good, some not so good, I share my experiences and trials of faith, so you can be enlightened and encouraged as you continue on your journey of understanding. Once you embrace and unite with your faith, the world will truly become your oyster and it will not matter where you are or what you are facing. My wife, Phyllis and our two sons, Ryan and Corban, are enjoying our journey of faith together; a journey that currently has us residing in Katy, Texas and a faith that will allow us to continue to move and live and have our being in Him." />
