  <title>Messianic Political Theology and Diaspora Ethics: Essays in Exile - P. Travis Kroeker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Political theology as a normative discourse has been controversial not only for secular political philosophers who are especially suspicious of messianic claims but also for Jewish and Christian thinkers who differ widely on its meaning. These essays mount an argument for a &quot;Messianic Political Theology&quot; rooted in an interpretation of biblical (especially Pauline), Augustinian, and Radical Reformation readings of messianism as a thoroughly political and theological vision that gives rise to what the author calls &quot;Diaspora Ethics.&quot; In conversation also with Platonic, Jewish, and Continental thinkers, Kroeker argues for an exilic practice of political ethics in which the secular is built up theologically &quot;from below&quot; in the form of public service that flows from messianic political worship. Such a &quot;weak messianic power&quot; practiced by the messianic body inhabits an apocalyptic political economy in which the mystery of love and the mystery of evil are agonistically unveiled together in the power of the cross--not as an instrument of domination but in the form of the servant. This is not simply a matter of &quot;pacifism&quot; but of a messianic posture rooted in the renunciation of possessive desire that pertains to all aspects of everyday human life in the household (oikos), the academy, and the polis." />
