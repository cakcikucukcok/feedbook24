  <title>The Ten Biggest Lies of the Enemy - Deacon Keith Strohm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus died to set us free, yet we all experience thoughts from the enemy that lead us away from Christ and his truth. Popular author and speaker Deacon Keith Strohm shines God&#39;s light on ten of the most common lies that Satan uses to bind our hearts and prevent us from experiencing the fullness of God&#39;s love. Not only does Deacon Strohm helps us gain clarity to the ways in which these lies take hold and imprison us. He also shows us that through the use of Scripture and the spiritual traditions of the Church, we can break the power and authority those lies have in our lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want to be drawn closer in our relationship with Jesus Christ and more secure in our identities as sons and daughters of God, so we can never be too vigilant in battling the lies of the enemy. This book offers valuable wisdom for any Christian—those just beginning to follow Christ and those who are more mature in their faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
