  <title>A Silence That Kills - Eben L. Le Roux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GAUTENG, South Africa 
Peter Johnson had only one wish; he wished to be a teacher again. Problem is, he was a hobo and nobody was going to ever employ him. 
The wealthy Atkinson family was desperately trying to overcome their grief. Not being able to get over the deaths of their twin daughters in a car accident, the husband, Michael, was slowly turning into a monster. Both the Atkinsons and Peter saw their redemption in a miracle event that was coming to town. A heavy thunderstorm however, disrupted peoples efforts to get tickets for this event. When the beggar offer the Atkinsons to queue for them in exchange for a ticket, Kathy eagerly accepted. The Pastor however, got seriously injured in a car accident on his way and the event had to be cancelled. When thousands of people started to leave the stadium in disappointment, the beggar became saddened at the commitment of their faith. Still dressed in his pitiable cloths, he took to the stage and challenged their devotion to God over the powerful speakers. You are so concerned in your own personal healing that you would not care if this whole world rots around you, he screamed at them. 
Being the professional teacher he once was, he followed that with a most powerful speech from the podium.
Bruce Ashton, a highly acclaimed television producer, became enthrall by the intellect of the beggar but was told by his bosses; Sorry, God does not sell; sex, money and violence are whats bringing in the money for any television company. 
Risking his future as a producer and counting only on the wisdom of the beggar, Bruce Ashton persuaded Peter Johnson to take up role in a TV program. Together they started what was to become a very controversial crusade. The hobos life was never going to be the same again; nor the lives of those who would get involved with his.
In this novel, Eben L Le Roux brings people together in a plot that could only be generated by divine intervention.
A book so inspiring, motivating, fast paced and thought provoking, it will be hard to put down." />
