  <title>You Can Be Healed - Elliot Foggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In You Can Be Healed: Biblical Pathways to Healing, Elliot Foggs offers his unique perspective on how God heals and how we can appropriate His healing in our lives. He focuses on the Word of God and Jesus Christ as healer of physical, mental, and emotional sickness. His teachings on healing and stories from his own personal life and ministry may inspire readers to believe and pray for healing in their own lives and the lives of others.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how long you have been sick, what your doctors have said, or how many obstacles you have had to overcome, let these words reach deep down into your spirit. Receive them by faith. Your healing is closer than you think. Maybe you are like the woman in the Bible with the issue of blood and have been ill for many years. Maybe you have spent all your money seeking professional medical care. Maybe the doctors have given you little or no hope of recovery. Maybe you are frustrated because of your condition. Yet now is not the time to talk yourself out of Gods promise. Now is not the time to get discouraged. You may feel that any meaningful healing is far away. But the truth is your healing may be just around the corner. If you stay in faith, who knows? The time of your healing could be now! Your healing is closer than you think. I believe that you can be healed.&lt;p&gt;" />
