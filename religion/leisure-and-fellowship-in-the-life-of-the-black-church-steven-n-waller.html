  <title>Leisure and Fellowship in the Life of the Black Church - Steven N. Waller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leisure and Fellowship in the Life of the Black Church explores why leisure and fellowship in
congregational life of African American churches matters. The book provides a biblical
and theological foundation for the concepts of work, rest, Sabbath, play, leisure and
fellowship. Moreover, the book explores how religious tradition and doctrine shape and
constrains our attitudes and behaviors about leisure, fellowship and living abundantly.
Several churches are lifted as exemplars based on the way that they embrace leisure
and fellowship within their respective congregations. In the closing chapters, the book
examines what leisure and fellowship might be like in Heaven and how we engage Christ
and each other in congregations." />
