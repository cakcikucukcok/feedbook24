  <title>A Layman’S Commentary Volume 8 - John Devine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays world, it can be difficult to maintain your faith. Those seeking a greater understanding of the Bible have numerous excellent theological commentaries available to them, but due to volume and depth, many of these are out of reach of laypeople. Others lose contact with the Bible, because it no longer seems relevant to life. They use a superficial knowledge of science and evolution to exclude God and faith from their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laymans Commentary: Volume 8General Epistles presents a passage by passage explanation of the nine letters of the Bible to the early churches from general authors who were eyewitnesses or associates and spoke of their experience of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this eighth volume, author John Devine explains the practical relevance of these documents as they relate to effective everyday living. He considers the relevance of creation and science, as well as Gods moral standard which is of vital importance in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These letters are shown to conform with the Gospels and the letters of Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews explains the connection of the Old Testament with the First Coming of Jesus. Revelation describes the fulfillment with the Second Coming of Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods plan for a relationship with the individual is explained with the means by which this was made possible by the death and resurrection of his Son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes confirm that science and faith are complementary in giving purpose and meaning to life. The expectation of eternal life is also assured.&lt;/p&gt;" />
