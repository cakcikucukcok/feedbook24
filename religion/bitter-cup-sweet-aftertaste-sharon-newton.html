  <title>Bitter Cup, Sweet Aftertaste - Sharon Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you know that you are heir to a vast fortune God has in reserve for you? This life-changing story will provide you with the knowledge needed to take full possession of your inheritance. It is a riveting tale of the journey that Chaya, a Hebrew slave, embarked upon with the Israelites on the way to the Promised Land, where their lives were destined to be rich and fulfilling. Having suffered for four hundred years in slavery to the Egyptians, the Lords plan was to use His servant Moses to lead them out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the land that flowed with milk and honey. 
Unfortunately, when they were right on the verge of their destination, they rebelled against God, and He sentenced them to spend the rest of their lives in the wilderness. Like many modern-day Christians, they did not understand His wayshow He uses adversity and long waits to mature His children in preparation for the extraordinary lives He has for them. Instead of responding to the difficulties they faced by trusting and obeying Him, they complained, disobeyed, and doubted that He really cared for them. Therefore, like many Christians today, they forfeited His plan for their lives. Chaya is determined that she and her family will not make the same mistakes, but will glean the proper lessons from every experience. Walk with them as the Lord leads you into a life that is lush with purpose and abundance." />
