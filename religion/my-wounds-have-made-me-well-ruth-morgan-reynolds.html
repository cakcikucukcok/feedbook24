  <title>My Wounds Have Made Me Well - Ruth Morgan Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;We all experience loss and tragedy in our lives. We can be wounded emotionally and physically. Sometimes, the wounds never heal. For some of us, the scars will remain forever, serving as a constant reminder of our hardship. We must learn to cope and get back on our feet. Learning how others have dealt with severe injury and handicaps can help guide us to recovery and provide reassurance that we are not alone. But, we are never really alone. God is always by our side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;My Wounds Have Made Me Well &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of Ruth Morgan Reynolds quest to pull her life back together after a 5-ton work truck slammed into her vehicle head-on while she drove home from work one day. Her plans for her life were derailed, her mobilitybecame limited, and she felt lost and adrift. In despair and anguish, she began to read the Bible from a new perspective, that of the afflicted in the stories and parables of Jesus. She realized God had given her a great gift- the ability to see beyond herself, and how He intervenes to widen our perspectives and to refocus us on our true calling in life: to serve and have faith in Him. God challenges us to learn and grow from our experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
