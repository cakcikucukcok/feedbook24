      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Extracts from the Mystical City of God&amp;nbsp;VOL 1&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;THE CONCEPTION &lt;/b&gt;::&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&amp;#39;The holy angels spoke to me:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;This is that blessed Woman, whom Saint John saw in the Apocalypse, and in whom are enclosed, deposited and sealed up the wonderful mysteries of the Redemption. So much has the most high and powerful God favored this Creature, that we, his angelic spirits, are full of astonishment. Contemplate and admire her prerogatives, record them in writing, because that is the purpose for which, according to the measure suitable to thy circumstances, they will be made manifest to thee&amp;quot; .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;On another day, while my soul sweetly tarried in the aforesaid habitation, I heard a voice from the Most High saying:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;My spouse, I desire that thou rouse thyself in earnest to seek Me, and to love Me with fervor; that thou make thy life more angelic than human, and that thou forget entirely the terrestrial affairs. I wish to raise thee as one that is poor from the dust, and as one full of need from the dunghill (Ps. 112:7), so that, while I exalt thee, thou mayest humiliate thyself, and the nard of thy sweet odor may remain in my presence (Cant. 1:11); knowing thy own misery, be thou convinced from the bottom of thy heart, that thou meritest for thyself only tribulation and humiliation. Consider my greatness and thy littleness; remember that I am just and holy; I deal with thee considerately, making use rather of my mercy and not chastising thee as thou deservest. Strive to build upon this foundation of humility all the other virtues in order to fulfill my wishes. I appoint my Virgin Mother to teach, correct and reprehend thee. She will spur thee onward and accompany thy footsteps according to my liking and pleasure.&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(&lt;/i&gt;Ven. Mary of Agreda, Mystical City of God, Vol. I, 5-6)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
