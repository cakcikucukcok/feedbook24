  <title>God’S Redeeming Plan - William Edward Dewberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about the hope of mankind for a more satisfying and meaningful life based on the knowledge of God and Christ. A better understanding of the Word of God results in producing faith, hope, and love in the hearts of readers and believers. The complete Word of God revealed in the Bible is believed and practiced by millions. This book is written in language that is easy to understand and reveals the mystery of salvation for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author William Edward Dewberry hopes to give a comprehensible view of Gods plan that will lead readers to examine the Holy Scriptures more thoroughly and become better acquainted with the plan of God that is able to lead a person to salvation through their faith in Christ. The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart [that is, the word of faith that we preach] that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explains the redeeming plan of God, the great benefits of believing, and the dire consequences of ignoring the Creator and His Son, Jesus Christ. It explains Gods plan from the day of creation to the day that the earth and everything in it will be destroyed by extreme heat. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness. (2nd Peter 3:10-11)&lt;/p&gt;" />
