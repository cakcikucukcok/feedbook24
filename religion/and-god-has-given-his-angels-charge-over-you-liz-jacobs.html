  <title>And God Has Given His Angels Charge over You - Liz Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a testimony that will draw the reader into an incredible story of the creator rescuing a broken, shattered woman and her innocent baby by sending angels to her aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman spent endless days, weeks, and perhaps even months begging and praying to him to help her. While she believed in him, she didnt believe that he would help. There came a pivotal point in the story where hope seemed to die and she felt an acknowledgment from deep within that he didnt even exist at all. Truly at the end of her ropean angel appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be hard to set the story aside because a sense of the creators love will entice you to see what he will do. She will be challenged to depend totally on the gentle whisper from within her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will journey with herfrom a time in the past when a part of who she was seemed to die, to where the creator challenges her to let go and let him guide her into a new life. While the initial healings would total a five year period that was hard, tear-filled, and challenging, the majority of those things that had tormented her mind would be exposed and healed. Even more healings would come in her journey down the road to wholeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His provision on her behalf is truly awe-inspiring and will offer hope and encouragement to all. If he would rescue, forgive, and love her, how much more will he work in your life and the lives of others that reach out to him in time of need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators love for each is unconditional! Truly seek him, and you will find his love actively working on your behalf as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To him be all the glory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
