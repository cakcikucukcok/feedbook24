  <title>Deep Thinking - Apostle Charles Louis King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book Deep Thinking is a Gospel inspirational book that was born from the Apostolic anointing that has overshadowed the life of Apostle King for the past seven years. This book delves into some deep insights from the Word of God. It will not only challenge the seasoned believer, but it will inspire the new convert to take the limits off God. Apostle King has an extensive background in ministry, working in both the field of evangelism and that of a pastor. He has a unique way of presenting the truth from the Word of God. This book will make one look at the Bible from a new set of eyes and hopefully glean a new perspective. However, what you receive from this book may come to you in a new and exciting revelation.
It is only God who is able to take nothing and make something wonderful and exciting appear before you. If you will allow God, the opportunity to speak directly into your spirit. I truly believe that Deep Thinking will be one of those books that you will read over and over again. It is my sincere desire that the rest of your life will be the best of your life." />
