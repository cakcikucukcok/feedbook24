  <title>Kingdom Way - Scharlotte Celestine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It takes childlike faith to know God. I came to the realization that most of my life I was missing the one key thing that makes all the difference in our relationship with Daddy God, and that is having the heart of a child. Surrendering to God and asking Jesus into your heart is the start of the relationship, but where do you go from there? The Bible is the answer. One of the scariest things Ive ever read was I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness! (Matthew 7:23). Those words spoken by Jesus were motivation enough to seek a deeper relationship with him. But you have to spend time with someone to truly know them. Kingdom Way was written to inspire you to seek a deeper relationship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It leads you through basic principles you need to grasp in order to move forward in spiritual growth and deeper relationship. Whether you are a mature Christian, a new believer, or someone seeking the meaning of what it is to be a Christian, this book is for you. Lets learn to be true ambassadors for Christ, to see the world as Jesus sees it, with his love, mercy, forgiveness, and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
