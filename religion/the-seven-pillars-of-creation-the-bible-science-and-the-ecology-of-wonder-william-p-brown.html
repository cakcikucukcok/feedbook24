  <title>The Seven Pillars of Creation: The Bible, Science, and the Ecology of Wonder - William P. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In their highly selective and literal reading of Scripture, creationists champion a rigidly reductionistic view of creation in their fight against soulless scientism. Conversely, many scientists find faith in God to be a dangerous impediment in the empirical quest for knowledge. As a result of this ongoing debate, many people of faith feel forced to choose between evolution and the Bibles story of creation.   But, as William Brown asks, which biblical creation story are we talking about? Brown shows that, through a close reading of biblical texts, no fewer than seven different biblical perspectives on creation can be identified. By examining these perspectives, Brown illuminates both connections and conflicts between the ancient creation traditions and the natural sciences, arguing for a new way of reading the Bible in light of current scientific knowledge and with consideration of the needs of the environment. In Browns argument, both scientific inquiry and theological reflection are driven by a sense of wonder, which, in his words, unites the scientist and the psalmist. Browns own wonder at the beauty and complexity of the created world is evident throughout this intelligent, well-written, and inspirational book." />
