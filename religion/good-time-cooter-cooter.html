  <title>Good-Time Cooter - Cooter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for those who are looking for more in the Lord than routine. The Lord always has more for those that are seeking him. In the pages in my book are some exciting experiences I have had the opportunity to live out. Many of them are humorous, and some are serious. Some will make you laugh, and some will bring a tear to your eyes. My prayer is that, as you read, you will find yourself in some of the same situations I have been in and watch the Lord show up and show out. I claim many souls in the name of Jesus as you expand your territory to serve him. My hope is that these stories will cause you to swim out into deeper waters.
As I come to the end of this chapter of my life, many more experiences are occurring even as I write. The Holy Spirit is always moving. There is no end to his adventure and no containing his glory. All we have to do is grab as much as we can as we go and do in Jesuss name. May you walk in the destiny God has set before you. Its a life that will never be disappointing because he gives us life and more abundantly. I am so thankful the Lord saved me and took some things away. I am more thankful for what he gave me instead. He is the only one who can bring joy and peace.
Most people will not submit to the Lord. It is because they dont want to give up something. Its not what youre going to give up, its what youre going to receive that makes the difference. You can be happy now. Not just when you get to heaven. Joy can be yours now!
May God richly bless you as these pages cause something to come alive inside of you." />
