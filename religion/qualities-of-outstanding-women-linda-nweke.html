  <title>Qualities of Outstanding Women - Linda Nweke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Outstanding success represents all-round success&quot;
                 Linda Nweke
Every woman is born to excel. You were created to have influence of some sort. You were designed to impact your world. Your pursuit of excellence will position you for outstanding success.
Understand that influence does not have to be rapid. The influence that endures is usually a gradual process. In order to genuinely impact the lives of those around you, patience is required, wisdom is essential and divine favour is a must.
Within the pages of this book lie some powerful and practical keys that will unlock the golden potential that resides within you. Together we will embark on a journey to explore the lives of some outstanding women who have gone before us. You will learn from both their victories and their failures. A variety of subjects have been meticulously discussed in this book and some of them are:
Why God made the woman.
Far above rubies.
The woman of covenant.
Until she arose.
The power of expectation.
Qualities of outstanding women.
Grace is enough.
Linda Nweke (B.A.), is the co-pastor of the Joyful Assembly London, a Bible teacher, counselor and motivational speaker. She is the author of &quot;Empowered by Grace&quot; and &quot;Transformed by a Word&quot;. Linda is the president/founder of Joyful Ladies International Fellowship. She is married to Uche and their marriage is blessed with four lovely children." />
