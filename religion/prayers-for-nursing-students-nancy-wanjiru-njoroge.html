  <title>Prayers for Nursing Students - Nancy Wanjiru Njoroge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nancy never made it to a college of her choice after graduation. She wanted to become a nurse, and because of the few colleges in Kenya, being unable to obtain a grade equivalent to C+ in high school, and lack of fees and tuition, she never got admitted to any of the nursing colleges in Kenya. For about 20 years, Nancy had a dream of becoming a nurse. After many years of waiting and almost forgetting her dream, God brought it to pass in a miraculously way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Prayers for Nursing Students tells about how her journey started and how Nancy prayed true prayers that came from her heart. These extraordinary prayers were prayed every day after school, even with a busy schedule. The collection of everyday prayers by an ordinary person changed her life and made her who she wanted to become. These prayers may bring a turnaround in your way of thinking. Prayers for Nursing Students tells of people in the Bible who prayed, and God answered their prayers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;After many years of waiting, God does not forget the desires of our heart. He will come at the right time and fulfill his promises. I believe God will use one or many of these prayers to help you accomplish your dreams. With prayer, patience, and determination you can accomplish your purpose in life. You have the potential. Do not quit!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
