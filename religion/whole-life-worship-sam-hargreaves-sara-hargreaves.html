  <title>Whole Life Worship - Sam Hargreaves, Sara Hargreaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a continuation of the LICC series begun by Neil Hudson&#39;s Imagine Church&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whole-Life Worship &lt;/i&gt;will demonstrate that the contemporary Western Church has reached a point where our &quot;gathered&quot; worship is separated from our &quot;scattered&quot; lives outside of church. This is detrimental to the congregation&#39;s spiritual development and their effectiveness on their &quot;frontlines&quot;. Church worship should be inspired and informed by our everyday experiences. It should empower and send the congregation out to continue worshipping. The book will provide patterns and resources to better connect gathered worship  with the lives of the congregation beyond church meetings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book will unpack a biblical grounding for both gathered and scattered worship. It will then identify patterns within our gathered services which help us re-make these connections. It will provide practical resources such as songs, prayers and activities which can help churches connect Sunday to the rest of the week. It will draw examples and stories from other church streams and traditions, to demonstrate how different kinds of Christian spirituality engage worshipfully with everyday life. In the second half of the book is a practical resource looking specifically at different aspects of a gathered service, and how each one can have an &quot;outward&quot; dimension.&lt;/p&gt;" />
