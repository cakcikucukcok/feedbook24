  <title>God&#39;s Little Instrument - Sandra C. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about relationship and the joy of loving our Lord because He loves us for who we are not for who we think we should be.  This book is inviting you to set aside your bucket lists.  The poetry encourages you to slow down and to view God through the eyes of a child.  To remember when your only goal in life was to please Him and not the world.  Read the poems and lose yourself in the artwork that will take you to heaven and back.  This book is meant to be enjoyed by the  whole spectrum of life; from the very young right through to the old, ( I should know I&#39;m 61)  as you share it with your loved ones.   It&#39;s about embracing the little child in us that God so fearfully and wonderfully made.  One look at the dynamic illustrations drawn by my niece Danielle Marie Robinson and you will feel inspired to sing praises to the Lord.  The poems were written as celebrations of key moments in the authors life that touched her very soul.  God never said keep his blessings to yourself so she shares her vision of being God&#39;s little instrument with you.  Enjoy and be blessed." />
