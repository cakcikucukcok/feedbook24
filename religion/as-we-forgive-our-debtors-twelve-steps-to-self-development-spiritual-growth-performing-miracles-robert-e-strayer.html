But special relationships other than alcohol can be confusing. &quot;...As We Forgive Our Debtors&quot; is designed to deal with all special relationships at the same time.       If you have friends in Twelve-Step, this guide will help you assist in their growth. If you want personal change, this can become your familiar, loving guide.
