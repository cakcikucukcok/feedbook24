  <title>Painting Proverbs - Temphest Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Painting Proverbs is an interactive sketch book that provides biblical content and an opportunity to bring scriptures to life by painting your personal perception page by page, one verse at a time. 
This idea came to me when doing an assignment with my church, Fresh Wind Ministries in Las Vegas, Nevada about five years ago. 
Our Pastor, Paul Kelker, challenged us to read one chapter from Proverbs every day for thirty-one days. 
When doing this assignment I quickly realized that reading my bible everyday was not an issue, but remembering the content I read was the real challenge.
Therefore, as a way to engage more with what I was reading I chose to draw a picture of a verse from each chapter I read, and in doing so I was able to retain the content so much easier and bring my bible study to life. Finally, I understood why people called it the Living Word." />
