  <title>The Second Chance for God&#39;s People: Messages from Hebrews - Timothy W. Seid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For centuries the New Testament book of Hebrews has been interpreted as though it had been written for Jewish Christians in danger of lapsing back into legalism and religious ceremony. This view is now being challenged by current scholarship. Rather than attacking the Old Testament and Judaism, the author of Hebrews praises the person and work of Jesus through a series of comparisons on which he bases exhortations and warnings to the present people of God. Hebrews urges God&#39;s people to learn from past mistakes and failures, and to take up the challenge in difficult times to live faithfully in the new relationship to God through Jesus, God&#39;s Son.  In The Second Chance for God&#39;s People: Messages from Hebrews, Quaker pastor and professor Timothy W. Seid encourages today&#39;s church to respond to the challenge of Hebrews: first individually by progressing in spiritual and moral maturity, and second collectively by being God&#39;s faithful people in the world. In the light of ancient Greek language and rhetoric after having extensively researched Hebrews, Seid interprets the text of Hebrews section by section in an accessible and nontechnical way while also illustrating and applying the meaning of the text for the contemporary church." />
