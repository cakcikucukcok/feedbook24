  <title>Money and Morals - Charles Akujieze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many are striving to have money without forsaking moral values. However, the results have been lamentably discouraging. Often times, those seeking wealth end up sacrificing moral principles and sometimes even their faith on the altar of Mammon.
No one becomes a financial star unless and until he engages in financial exercises. Greatness, like success is prepared for, not stumbled upon. Nobody succeeds by accident. To be a financial high flyer, you need some financial exercises. It takes the eagles game to become 10,000 feet high-flying eagle.  Eaglets are born but eagles are made. If the eaglet is not trained to fly, it will die up there in the nest. Likewise, many people have &quot;died&quot; in their financial nest even when they have glorious and prosperous destinies. They have never exercised themselves into high-flying status of life. The demands of championship and being in financial rest does not reckon with praying and fasting but with rigorous financial exercises. 
Engaging in this exercise entails discovering how to develop investment mentality and financial intelligence, knowing and using the power to create wealth, knowing and walking the pathway to wealth, knowing and using the vehicles of wealth creation, activating multiple streams of income, knowing how to activate generational blessing." />
