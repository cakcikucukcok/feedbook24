  <title>Prayers of the Early Church - J. Manning Potts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early Christianity developed out of the eschatological ministry of Jesus. Subsequent to Jesus&amp;#39; death, his earliest followers formed an apocalyptic messianic Jewish sect during the late Second Temple period of the 1st century. Initially believing that Jesus&amp;#39; resurrection was the start of the endtime, their beliefs soon changed in the expected second coming of Jesus and the start of God&amp;#39;s Kingdom at a later point in time. Paul the Apostle, a pious Jew who had persecuted the early Christians, converted c. 33&amp;ndash;36 and started to proselytize among the Gentiles. According to Paul, Gentile converts could be allowed exemption from most Jewish commandments, arguing that all are justified by faith in Jesus. This was part of a gradual split of early Christianity and Judaism, as Christianity became a distinct religion including predominantly Gentile adherence.&lt;br /&gt;
Jerusalem had an early Christian community, which was led by James the Just, Peter, and John. Antioch was where the followers were first called Christians. Peter was later martyred in the see of Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire. The apostles went on to spread the message of the Gospel around the classical world and founded apostolic sees around the early centers of Christianity. The last apostle to die was John in c. 100." />
