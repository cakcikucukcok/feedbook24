      <meta name="description" content="Satan has caused some believers to lower their standards and to place limitations on life by influencing them to think they cant do any better. This book was written to be your weapon of resources to learn to stand against the attacks of Satan.
Jesus states in John 10:10 that the thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. And to counter that Jesus says, I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
Satan doesnt want to see you living in abundance, and he doesnt want to see you walking upright with the Lord. He comes to steal your riches, kill your inheritance, and destroy your faith in God.
But you can walk in the abundant life God intended!
You can fight and win!
Its time to gather your weapons. Your greatest arsenal is to stand on the true word of God." />
