      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - John 1:1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of John has profound depths of meaning, inviting the reader into the mystery of God become man. Yet plumbing its depths of meaning is not a simple task. It requires prayerful and careful reading. It is also helpful to have a guide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this line-by-line exposition, you will be able to dig deeper into the Gospel, probing the meaning of each passage. The focus of this exposition is the meaning of John&#39;s Gospel at the time of its writing as well as its meaning for us today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you practice prayerful reading (lectio divina), prepare homilies, lead or participate in Bible study groups, are a Scripture teacher or seminarian, you will find George Martin to be an enlightening and accessible guide to John&#39;s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
