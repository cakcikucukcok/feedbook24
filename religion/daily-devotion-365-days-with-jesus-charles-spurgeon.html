      <meta name="description" content="Written by Charles Spurgeon, Daily Devotion - 365 Days With Jesus is a daily meditation on the Word of God.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are 3651 days of intimacy with the Lord Jesus, in a book with many messages of faith and hope.&lt;br /&gt;
A message of faith and hope for every day of the year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charles Spurgeon was one of the most important Christian writers of all time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charles Haddon (CH) Spurgeon,19 June 1834 - 31 January 1892) was a British Particular Baptist preacher. Spurgeon remains highly influential among Christians of various denominations, among whom he is known as the &amp;quot;Prince of Preachers&amp;quot;. He was a strong figure in the Reformed Baptist , defending the Church in agreement with the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith understanding, and opposing the liberal and pragmatic theological tendencies in the Church of his day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is estimated that in his lifetime, Spurgeon preached to around 10,000,000 people,Spurgeon was the pastor of the congregation of the New Park Street Chapel (later the Metropolitan Tabernacle) in London for 38 years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spurgeon was a prolific author of many types of works including sermons, an autobiography, commentaries, books on prayer, devotionals, magazines, poetry, hymns and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many sermons were transcribed as he spoke and were translated into many languages during his lifetime. Spurgeon produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. His oratory skills held his listeners spellbound in the Metropolitan Tabernacle and many Christians have discovered Spurgeon&amp;#39;s messages to be among the best in Christian literature." />
