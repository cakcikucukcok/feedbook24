  <title>Our Christian Founding Fathers - William Beckman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The American public has been told what recent historians wanted them to believe: the United States is not a Christian nation. This is true in only one respect. You dont have to be a Christian following a specific denomination to be an American citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ideological foundation this country is based on Christian principles, developed by Christian Founding Fathers. Modern historians have distorted these facts. To correct these distortions, the biographies of the Founding Fathers, their actual statements and Christian beliefs, are presented in this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for the birth of our nation was the moment when Benjamin Franklin, incorrectly considered a Deist by many, suggested that the quarrelsome Continental Convention recognize how the Creator had listened to and answered their prayers in the past. He suggested daily prayer be instituted, asking  henceforth, prayers imploring the assistance of heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this assembly every morning The quarreling continued, but the emphasis became how to successfully unite the newly independent colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonies united under Christian principles; however, over the years those principles and their original intent have been diluted. Recognizing the condition of the world today, isnt it a good time to renew those principles?&lt;/p&gt;" />
