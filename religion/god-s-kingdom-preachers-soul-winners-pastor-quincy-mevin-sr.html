      <meta name="description" content="THE GREAT COMMISSION 
Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations baptizing them in the name Of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always; even unto the end of the world Amen (Matthew 28: 18-20).
In addition, he said unto them go ye into the entire world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
In addition, these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16: 15-18).
God intended for his Church to spread His Word abroad through the whole world from the early part of his kingdom." />
