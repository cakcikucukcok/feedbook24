  <title>Everything You Want to Know about Jesus - Peter Douglas Downey, Ben James Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Jesus is the most influential person who ever lived. But for many of us, he has ceased to be a real person. We’ve sanitised him with pious jargon, framed him in stained glass, and reduced him to a religious puppet who floats through biblical landscapes dispensing Christian cliches and nice advice. It’s time for a fresh look at the man this book describes as “a square peg in a society of round holes.” Whether you’re new to Jesus or just want to rediscover him with fresh eyes, this is the book for you. No dry theological treatise, it’s written in an engaging, sometimes even humorous, style. In short, readable chapters, you’ll get a tour of important background info and fascinating history that will bring to life the era in which Jesus lived. Then you’ll read about his birth, his adult ministry and teaching, and the crucial last week of his life on earth. You’ll catch a glimpse of the impact and excitement as news of Jesus spread around the world. And finally, you’ll be inspired to think about what Jesus means for us today.&lt;/P&gt;" />
