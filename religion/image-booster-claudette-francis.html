  <title>Image Booster - Claudette Francis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Image Booster is about empowering young people with knowledge that will help them find focus for their lives. In so doing, they will come to realize their God-given gifts and talents, discover their purpose in life, and ultimately reach their full potential. 
Lack of finances, encouragement, inspiration, and purpose are big problems facing todays young people, who are searching for something more than the world has to offer them. It is hoped that Image Booster will instill dignity and value in all young people and help them realize that there is more to life than guns, drugs, violence, and a boring life. The twenty-four messages are designed to encourage students to persevere in good works and overcome problems that would hinder them from attaining their ultimate destiny as they try to navigate their complex world. 
Some of the messages deal with fear, anger, peer pressure, bullying, blessing, service, and choices. The students are challenged to respond to these issues like children of God and, therefore, inspire other young people to emulate their way of dealing with issues. 
The young people are encouraged to take Jesus as their hero and role model and learn from His example. By doing so, they are able to focus their attention on the new commandment given to them by Jesus Himself. Love one another as I have loved you." />
