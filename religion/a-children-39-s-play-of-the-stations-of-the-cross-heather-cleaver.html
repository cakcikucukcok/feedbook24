  <title>A Children&#39;s Play of the Stations of the Cross - Heather Cleaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this play, The Stations of the Cross become meaningful for children as they reenact Jesus&#39; story and depict His suffering, sacrifice, and love.  This book includes the script for A Children&#39;s Play of the Stations of the Cross, personal writing sections, directing notes annotated along the side of the script (for the young actor&#39;s ease of reading), pictures and directions for costumes/props, suggestions on how to tweak the play to make it suitalbe for your needs, and sample letters.  
If you are unable to put this play together at this time, it still serves as a fantastic read.  Reading through this is a great way to introduce young children to the Stations of the Cross, and it is also helpful for anyone, regardless of age, to reflect on Jesus&#39; Passion.
&quot;I have had the honor of viewing this play as written and directed by Heather Cleaver, and I have also been honored to have co-directed this play three times . . . What makes this play spectacular is how the characters come alive so that the audience feels both the characters pain and their joy.&quot;?Karen Plichta, Primary School Teacher" />
