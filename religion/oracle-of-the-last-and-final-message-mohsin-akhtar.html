  <title>Oracle of the Last and Final Message - Mohsin Akhtar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book reveals that over the millennia the revealed knowledge has evolved in accordance with the advancement of the human civilization. Accordingly by the advent of the Prophet Muhammad, it has been updated for the rest of the humanity till end of the world. Hence the prophet Hood has reached its peak and Muhammad remains the seal of the prophets till end of the world. The knowledge of revelation, endowed to the mankind remains over and above to their knowledge acquired through the instincts and the intuition.
The purpose of the revealed knowledge is that God wants His supreme creature to qualify for the righteous end, duly prescribed by Him. He has therefore provided us the syllabus, the text Books and the teachers. The last and final after the books of Torah and Gospel is the Quran and after the Prophets Moses and Jesus is the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon them all. 
Hence Islam is not a new religion, but the finalization of the Abrahams religion having the same purpose and the values meant by God through Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
The author hopes that this book will work to bring all the three big nations, the Jews, Christians and the Muslim closer to each other quitting behind hatred hidden in their hearts and combine them together at the similar cause, that is obedience and supplication to the Gods Commandments and peace and love for the humanity leaving behind all the prejudices and hatred. May God, the Allah guide us for the right path, Amen." />
