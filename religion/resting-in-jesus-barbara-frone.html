  <title>Resting in Jesus - Barbara Frone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Resting in Jesus: How to Live a Powerful, Amazing, and Victorious Life is about resting in Jesus by daily letting Gods Spirit and Word lead you down the path God has for youloving you, teaching you, restoring you, and comforting you along the way. So many of us are restless in our soul, but God wants us to be at rest. He wants us to be at peace, which this world cannot give us. What our restless soul is craving is only found in Jesus. Unfortunately, too many churches contribute to our restlessness by always preaching against sin, and this keeps us restless by making us feel guilty and never good enough for God. But our sin has been dealt with on the cross. God said he would remember our sin no more and neither should we. God now deals with us by his love, and the more our eyes are opened to how much he really loves us, the more sin wont be an issue in our lives anymore. Of course, we are still going to sin, by accident or on purpose, until Jesus comes, but preaching against it only keeps our mind on itand what we keep our mind on, grows. We need to keep our mind on Gods love for us and what he did for us on the cross, and that revelation is what gives us the power to be better and not want to sin any more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
