      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Can I More Effectively Reach People of My Generation with the Message of the Gospel?&amp;rdquo; Start the story where God starts the story. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s not about &amp;ldquo;lifestyle evangelism.&amp;rdquo; Or being cleverer than the person with whom you&amp;rsquo;re talking. Or knowing everything there is to know about the Bible. It&amp;rsquo;s about knowing what&amp;rsquo;s most important to your friends, family, coworkers, and others you meet along life&amp;rsquo;s journey. It&amp;rsquo;s about, to use author Ron Martoia&amp;rsquo;s words, discovering the &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; each of us lives every waking day of our lives. Once you know that, you&amp;rsquo;ll know how God&amp;rsquo;s story fits into our human stories. Jesus spread the Good News this way. He talked to people, asked them questions about who they were, what they were doing&amp;ndash;in short, he found out what made each person get out of bed every morning. And then he shared with them a bigger story&amp;ndash;and how they fit into it. Jesus knew that when people grasped God&amp;rsquo;s big picture, they felt compelled&amp;ndash;even overjoyed&amp;ndash;to be a part of it. In today&amp;rsquo;s increasingly individualistic, disenfranchised world, it&amp;rsquo;s never been more important to know God&amp;rsquo;s story and how one fits into it. Let Transformational Architecture be your guide to reaching those around you with God&amp;rsquo;s life-changing message of hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
