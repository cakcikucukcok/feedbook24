  <title>The Greatest! - James M. Ellison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is a need for us all to find out about ourselves; what are our hopes and dreams, and what is the deepest part of our soul all about? Will the things we have become reality in our vision or in the substance produced? Where is the person that we want to become? What will we rely on? Will our intellectual level or our spiritual leadership guide us? These things need to be taught to us; they come from growing as a child, developing, and being given a measure of spirit from the Holy God. Remember that a good spirit finds a way to freedom; an evil spirit will only decline and then perish. We need to always be even and uniformed in the ways we go. Understand that it is fictitious to believe in things not real, which prove over and over their worth to us is a false hope. Only accept the genuine truth, not a lie; therein is where our faith abounds. Is there any faith at all in you? Dont be freewheeling or loosened at hearts door; become sound, safe, and secure in what keeps us in the rim of perfection of Gods loving care. Love your neighbor. Have faith. Keep away from a make-believe world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
