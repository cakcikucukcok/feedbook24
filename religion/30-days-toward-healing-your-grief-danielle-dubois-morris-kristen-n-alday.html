  <title>30 Days toward Healing Your Grief - Danielle DuBois Morris, Kristen N. Alday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on Walking the Mourners Path, an eight-week support program designed to accompany people in their grief, 30 Days toward Healing Your Grief differs from other support resources by using a proven methodology that does not leave people in their pain but gently leads them forward from “that my loved one died” to “how my loved one lived” and finally to “how I must live to honor his or her memory.” 30 Days offers, for individuals and
small groups, a personal, print version of the successful program on which it’s based.
Published in workbook form (thirty daily reflections/studies), this book addresses many of the issues that develop with those struggling with grief. Questions—as well as inspirational stories from the author’s nearly fifteen years of group work—help readers understand that they are not alone in their pain. This book will assist mourners as they walk through pain, remember their loved one, honor the relationship, honestly address the
complications of grief, and find the courage to turn their pain into joyful living once again. Those who thought God had abandoned them will once again feel his presence through a renewed spiritual relationship with our Lord." />
