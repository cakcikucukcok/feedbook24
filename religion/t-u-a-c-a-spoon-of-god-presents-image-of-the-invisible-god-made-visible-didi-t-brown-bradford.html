  <title>T.U.A.C. a Spoon of God Presents Image of the Invisible God Made Visible - Didi T Brown-Bradford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe this book will give the reader a better visual how God see man, and how we should see God in a physical image of Himself.
1. God had created He Him in a physical form  (in a express image of Himself Hebrew 1:3)
2. By Father God the Creator, created He them  Them, indicating He as man / He as woman (Genesis 1:26 this creation of all things begin in God in the Spirit However, notice Genesis 2nd Chapter 1-15 verse. This is where God preformed His creation to become no longer in Spirit, but physical, which is in Genesis 2nd Chapter 1-15. Ephesian 4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as man are called in one hope; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all.
3. Joel 2 chapter talks about God doing a new thing within man; this may be a Didi-ism, but I do believe He / God the Creator was referring to the man Jesus. Jesus birth was different, or new to mans way of thinking and or how man became familiar with his way that things were created. I believe, Father God has the power and the will to create again! If He so desired; it is written, there is nothing new under the sun. (Read Ecclesiastes 1:9), and the new thing is, there will be a new heaven a new earth and man will live in on the new earth. (Read Revelation 21:1)
Peace I have been given
Peace I received
Peace I have
In Peace I come
Peace be with you
Peace be multiplied
Peace remain with us
May Father God blessing be with you, while you use this book to research, rethink, and revisit Father God and His Holy Word that became flesh and lived among mankind... I pray Father God will be pleased with me in writing this book, for the edifying of the Believers." />
