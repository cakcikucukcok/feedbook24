  <title>Female Education and Mission - Philippe Ouedraogo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume is the result of six years research in ‘Overcoming Obstacles to Female Education in Burkina Faso’. It narrates how Christians and religious groups can speed up female education and contribute to the socio-economic growth of Burkina Faso. Religious culture and traditions were seen as a problem to female education. However, the evidence from this research shows that Christianity is also part of the solution to a quality female education, thus a key factor of socio economic growth of the country. The author is currently working to advocate with families, churches/NGOs and the Government of Burkina Faso for a quality access to Female Education as a strategy to poverty reduction. This independent research comes along side others to inform policy makers, researchers, practitioners, aid agencies, religious communities and governments for a greater involvement in female education as one of the appropriate strategies for achieving Education for All." />
