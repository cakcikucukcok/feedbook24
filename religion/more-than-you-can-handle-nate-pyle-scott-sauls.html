  <title>More Than You Can Handle - Nate Pyle, Scott Sauls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;God won&#39;t give you more than you can handle.&quot; This is one of the most common and least helpful reassurances floating around Christian circles. It is anything but biblical. The truth is that God&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allow a lot more than we can handle. But why?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nate Pyle has walked through tragedy in his own life--professional uncertainty, the intense impact of mental illness, and the struggle to build a family because of a lost pregnancy, infertility, and adoption. As a pastor, Nate has cried with countless people experiencing deep and overwhelming pain. They want answers but perhaps even more, they want someone to sit with them as they lament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clich&amp;eacute;&amp;nbsp;Christianity tells us not to ask questions in hard times. Yet transformation awaits us in the dark night of the soul. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;More Than You Can Handle&lt;/em&gt;, Nate asks with you: &quot;God, where are you in this pain? Why don&#39;t you step in and act?&quot; Because when we courageously bring all of who we are to all of who God is--and stop pretending we can &quot;handle&quot; life--we encounter the God of Redemption. The good news isn&#39;t that we can handle everything, but rather that God promises to be with us at the very moments we can&#39;t handle anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skillfully weaving together his own story, the stories of others, and a powerful look at the life of Jesus, Nate delivers a fresh and timely response to the pain we each experience. As Nate reminds us, the only thing more overwhelming than the pain of life is the love of a God who carries that pain with us.&lt;/p&gt;" />

    	<p>"God won't give you more than you can handle." This is one of the most common and least helpful reassurances floating around Christian circles. It is anything but biblical. The truth is that God <em>does</em> allow a lot more than we can handle. But why? </p><p>Nate Pyle has walked through tragedy in his own life--professional uncertainty, the intense impact of mental illness, and the struggle to build a family because of a lost pregnancy, infertility, and adoption. As a pastor, Nate has cried with countless people experiencing deep and overwhelming pain. They want answers but perhaps even more, they want someone to sit with them as they lament. </p><p>Cliché Christianity tells us not to ask questions in hard times. Yet transformation awaits us in the dark night of the soul. In <em>More Than You Can Handle</em>, Nate asks with you: "God, where are you in this pain? Why don't you step in and act?" Because when we courageously bring all of who we are to all of who God is--and stop pretending we can "handle" life--we encounter the God of Redemption. The good news isn't that we can handle everything, but rather that God promises to be with us at the very moments we can't handle anything. </p><p>Skillfully weaving together his own story, the stories of others, and a powerful look at the life of Jesus, Nate delivers a fresh and timely response to the pain we each experience.
