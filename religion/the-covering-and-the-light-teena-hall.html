  <title>The Covering and the Light - Teena Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The teachings in The Covering and The Light were instilled to Teena Hall by God in a quiet season where He taught her how to be still, really still, in order to hear directly from Him. The Lord speaks to each and every one of us; however, we must spend time alone with Him to hear what He is imparting to us.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book shows us how to take time out and really hear from the Lord: Are you tired of being in darkness? Are you ready to walk in the light of the Lord? But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, Gods special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. (1 Peter 2:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will find lovely parallels to the animal kingdom that God uses to help us make sense of our lives. But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you. (Job 12:7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find in this book that the devotions will begin as gentle as a delicate, trickling stream and grow into a turbulent, monumental canyon. God shares His wisdom and His instructions for our daily lives; He also provides insight, as well as encouragement! Most of all, the Father of Lights shows us that He is our Fortress and Protector because He loves us more than words could ever say. Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. (John 17:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Covering and The Light could be compared to Letters from God by Ivan Tait.&lt;/p&gt;" />
