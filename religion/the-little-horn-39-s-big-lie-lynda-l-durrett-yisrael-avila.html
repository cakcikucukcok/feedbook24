  <title>The Little Horn&#39;s Big Lie! - Lynda L. Durrett, Yisrael Avila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever listened to a preacher bring a sermon on the pre-tribulation rapture? How wonderful it will be when we are all caught up with Jesus just before everything breaks loose here on earth? What about the one that is preached on how and why the Sabbath was changed to Sunday and give a list of reasons; none of them found in the Bible. Then there is tithing? They make sure to let us know we demonstrate our obedience through paying our tithing and giving back to God/Yahweh, and when we do not, we can
be cursed or not be blessed as we should. We cannot forget the sermon on the Gifts of God/Yahweh that are no longer for the church. These and other doctrinal views are commonly preached in the main stream Christian
Churches today. They are based off opinion of men and are often argued with verses from the Bible that have been taken out of context.
    It is interesting that the evangelical churches today claim to take and read the Bible literally. They claim every word to be the inerrant word of God/Yahweh. Many of them treat the Bible as God/Yahweh, yet there is not
a verse that can be found that says the Sabbath was changed to a Sunday, that the Saints will be raptured before the tribulation, or the church is to pay tithing. Nowhere will you find the Holy Spirit only gives just some
of the gifts on the list to believers today. You will not find a verse that specifically tells you once you are saved you are always saved. Instead, you will find volumes of verses that contradict each of these false doctrines being
preached.So, what does that say about our contemporary church today, the one that claims to take each word, statement, or verse literally, the very ones preaching about false teachers, teaching themselves, false doctrine?" />
