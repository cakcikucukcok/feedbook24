  <title>Crackheads Need Love Too - Deidra Lee Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone has that family member, loved one, or friend who battles some form of addictionfrom drugs and alcohol, to sex, gambling, and even spending. In &lt;em&gt;Crackheads Need Love Too&lt;/em&gt;, author Deidra Lee Thompson helps you understand that anyone struggling with addiction has deeper rooted issues, hurts, and past experiences that have caused them to turn to the addiction as a source of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on her personal experiences with her husbands addiction to crack, Thompson offers Christian-based advice on how to deal with and help a loved one suffering from addiction. With ample scriptural references, &lt;em&gt;Crackheads Need Love Too&lt;/em&gt; shows how Gods word communicates that love covers a multitude of wrongs. We must learn to love the addict in the right manner that helps them to seek and gain freedom from these entanglements. Sometimes that manifests in tough love. Other times it manifests in setting limits with and for the person. She suggests that believers must have faith to believe and see the promises God work in the lives of those cast away by society, yes even crackheads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering a Christian perspective on addiction, &lt;em&gt;Crackheads Need Love Too&lt;/em&gt; shares both a personal story and extends hope to others who are experiencing similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
