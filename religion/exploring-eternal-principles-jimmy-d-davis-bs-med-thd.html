&lt;p&gt;God Almighty has established some very profound and sacred principles for lifea set of fundamental rules and laws that have an eternal impact on your life, whether you believe them or not. Sadly enough, the real truth of God has been distorted and perverted in our world today. Perhaps you believe the world and its lies; the time has come for each of us to learn and understand the real truth and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
