  <title>Intimacy with God Without Pretense - Ben Kimmich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book contains a call from God for us to have intimate fellowship with Him. Too often we try to achieve in the flesh that which can only be accomplished by His Spirit; for all that we are and all that we do should proceed from our relationship with Him. Many will take time off of work and travel long distances to experience the love of God, but few will take time off of work for solitary prayer with no other purpose than to hear His voice (Psalms 27:4).&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intimacy with God without Pretense addresses twenty-three facets of Christian life, all with the same focus: to hear His voice, know His will, and feel His heart.&lt;p&gt;" />
