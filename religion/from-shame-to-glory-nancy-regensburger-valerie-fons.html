  <title>From Shame to Glory - Nancy Regensburger, Valerie Fons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each woman named in Matthews record of the genealogy of Jesus made a journey from shame to glory. Grandmothers of Jesus included a prostitute, an adulterer, a nomad, and a trickster. His mother became pregnant before marriage. Certainly, Jesus heard the stories of his ancestors and utilized their life lessons as he made his way to the cross. For in spite of the laws and mores of their culture, these women displayed qualities of vision, risk, courage, truthfulness, and openness to Gods giftsall qualities Jesus would rely on in his own journey from shame to glory.
Reverend Valerie Fons and Christian Educator Nancy Regensburger share a unique, compelling, and positive presentation of the five women in the first book of Matthew while highlighting how God acts through the weak and powerless to bring forth glory. Through bible study, history lessons, introspective questions, poignant anecdotes, and opportunities for personal reflection, Fons and Regensburger provide a pathway to glory and inspiration for modern women seeking insight on their own spiritual journeys.
From Shame to Glory offers an interpretation of the genealogy of the significant women in the heritage of Jesus Christ that provides bible study group guidance and inspiration for anyone passionate about embracing Gods grace and wisdom." />
