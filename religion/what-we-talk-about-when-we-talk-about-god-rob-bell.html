  <title>What We Talk About When We Talk About God - Rob Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; God is described today strikes many as mean, primitive, backward, illogical, tribal, and at odds with the frontiers of science. At the same time, many intuitively feel a sense of reverence and awe in the world. Can we find a new way to talk about God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastor and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Rob Bell does here for God what he did for heaven and hell in &lt;em&gt;Love Wins&lt;/em&gt;: he shows how traditional ideas have grown stale and dysfunctional and reveals a new path for how to return vitality and vibrancy to how we understand God. Bell reveals how we got stuck, why culture resists certain ways of talking about God, and how we can reconnect with the God who is &lt;em&gt;with us&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;for us&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ahead of us&lt;/em&gt;, pulling us forward into a better future&amp;#8212;and ready to help us live life to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Instead, Bell argues that God is more clearly perceived during moments like, well, surfing.” (Orange County Register)<br /><b><i>What We Talk About When We Talk About God: Bell, Rob ...</i></b> | What We Talk About When We Talk About God (WWTAG) is the first book Rob Bell has written since Love Wins blew up the internet. Since then, Rob has stepped down from his position as Lead pastor at Mars Hill, the church he founded, and moved to the Los Angeles area.<br /><b><i>What We Talk about When We Talk about God by Rob Bell</i></b> | Rob Bell is the bestselling author of Love Wins, Velvet Elvis, Sex God, Jesus Wants to Save Christians, Drops Like Stars, and What We Talk About When We Talk About God.
