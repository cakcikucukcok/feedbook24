  <title>Peter - Jacquie Hoekstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This study invites you to walk with Peter from the time he was called to be a fisher of men through to his second letter and fulfilled calling. As you join Peter on his discipleship walk, you will be inspired by a regular guy who with Jesuss touch became a great man of God. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacquie Hoekstras study in Peter will draw the new believer as well as those who have walked years with the Lord into a deeper walk with Jesus. Her study is full of insights into Peters life plus personal reflection and challenges that makes it an excellent discipleship tool. &lt;br /&gt;

Co-founder and missionary with MCN International &lt;br /&gt;
(Ministries to Christian National, Inc.) for 30 years, &lt;br /&gt;
bringing Christ to Southeast Asia &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is really so much more than just a study of Peter! Jacquies thought provoking questions are effective to get past mindsets and blind spots allowing the readers to discover truths hidden below the surface. Jacquie is able to present even some of the most difficult sayings of Jesus in a way that uncovers sin, but in an encouraging manner; leading the reader into repentance and a deeper walk. &lt;br /&gt;
