  <title>Sara, Beyond the Veil - Rev. Susan J. Henley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Sara, the loss of her husband, Peter, was unbearable. Soon after he passed, Peter came to visit, taking her to various places that only they could go. Her children, refusing to believe that she was talking to him, assumed that she had dementia. She suffered a fall, and from that time on never returned to her home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while recovering, Sara was able to travel beyond The Veil, learning beautiful, heartfelt lessons that she was able to bring back with her and pass on to her children. Peter takes Sara on a journey both here and to the hereafter. Her life, and those of her children, is never the same. She finds an abundance of peace and serenity in a place that is timeless, where unconditional love creates healing and comfort and where the ravages of dementia cannot touch her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking among the angels, Saras desire is for everyone to know the place, beyond The Veil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
