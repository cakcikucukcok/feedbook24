  <title>Between the Darkness and the Light - Donald J. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Alexandria Hodgeman  represents a composite of many people I have known, Catholic and non-Catholic, senior citizens and middle-aged.  Her search for definition--for the meaning of her life--I intend as the type of search anyone ought to be pursuing, especially someone who is eighty-nine years old.  Her wisdom is the concomitant of her advanced years.  However, I doubt that she would permit me or anyone else to call her old.  Despite the challenges of advanced years, she still thinks like a young person, remaining optimistic while searching for answers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alexandrias life has been lived in service to others, despite her lack of total awareness of this.  She would modestly protest against anyone offering her thanks or recognition, deserved though they are.  Although certainly not a model, Alexandria is intended as a positive example of what one person can do, what one person can accomplish for others while simultaneously serving her God. &lt;/p&gt;" />
