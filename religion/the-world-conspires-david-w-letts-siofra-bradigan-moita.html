[1] Age of Metamorphosis:  an invitation to expanding consciousness&lt;p&gt;
From that first leap in your mind, the door to spirit opens  leading on toward direct experience of other realities. It is an entirely different experience to fly! &lt;p&gt;
Join the authors widely shared channeling sessions in chapters like these:&lt;p&gt;
?First Meetings with Moita    a variety of newcomers and their diverse reactions&lt;p&gt;
?Finding Your Own Path    through our mistakes, we grow to become our own teacher &lt;p&gt;
?A Universe of Presences    Moita states her difference from Seth and Edgar Cayces source
&lt;p&gt;?The Art of Discretion    the lesson Dr. Elisabeth Kbler-Ross learned, after seeking Moitas help with the scandal that ultimately threatened her courageous life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[2] The World Conspires:  an adventure in psychic/spiritual exploration &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The unfolding of a visionary journey, as David and Kelly (Siofra) learn to flow with new energies. As communications with Moita and yet higher levels evolve, experiences range . . .&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
? from depths:  Objects become fuzzy. Instantly Moitas presence is much stronger. She tells me that 
I am in danger. I am losing the thread of my consciousness. . . 
&lt;p&gt;?to heights:  The Earth is new, filled with the wonder of its discoveries. He speaks to the Sun and 
I speak to the Ground. We weave together what we are told and make it whole. &lt;p&gt;
?from personal:  There is much fear of joy in this world; and when people fear something, they want to destroy it. In order to release it, you must be very strong and know yourself very well.
&lt;p&gt;?to cosmic:  It is the arrival of the High Ones on your plane. The texture of the world is changing. 
We are preparing you for the inevitable shock of seeing us as we really are.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
from A Channeling for December 20, 2012&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Something is happening tomorrow, to everyone on the planet. There is a great deal of energy bent in this direction. It requires my complete presence. We have watched for a great many years, and now there is a drawing together of worlds, a time when the two worlds may touch, when they may integrate and understand. Life will never be the same again." />
