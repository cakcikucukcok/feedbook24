      <meta name="description" content="Be careful when you are spending more time looking around at your surroundings instead of listening to the voice that is calling you.  The winds of life will constantly blow and shift but we cannot afford to focus on the changing winds of life.  Instead, we must live by faith and stay focused on Christ.  The difference between surviving and sinking is a matter of who you are looking at.  In order to live a life free from fear we must remain focused on Christ at all times.  We cannot afford to look around or to look down but we must look up.  We cannot look at our condition but we must look at Christ.  We cannot depend on our friends to support us; we must look to the Savior to save us.  Just stay focused.  When fear shows up, doubt kicks in, your back is up against the wall, and the winds of life won&#39;t stop blowing, broken heart and tears in your eyes, just stay focused." />
