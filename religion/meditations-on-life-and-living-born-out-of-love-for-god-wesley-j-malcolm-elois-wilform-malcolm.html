      <meta name="description" content="Meditations on Life and LivingBorn Out of Love for God are basic but simple testimonials in story format with Scripture as the catalyst and theme for their birth. How many times have you sat alone somewhere just reflecting on the simplicity of lifehow blessed you are, from where you came compared to where you are now. Author, Elois Wilform-Malcolm, brings these everyday things to life. It will seem as though you are right there by her side, witnessing what she does in her own mind, seeing, feeling, understanding her point of view as she correlates biblical Scriptures into her reflections and how your understanding of Scripture can be a driving force for you own life.
Meditations on Life and LivingBorn Out of Love for God will allow you to relive your past, reflect on the glory of your present and marvel at your future when you realize the joy, happiness, contentment and peace of mind you attain through a life with God. You will see where you were before salvation, understand who you are in your salvation and strive to be even better through salvation. You will see how Scriptures are being brought to light through everyday life situations. Wait till you read catchy titles such as: Throw Down Your Rocks, The Fragrance of Christ, or Wake Up Everybody.
You will find excitement in the directions each testimonial meditation will take you.  Reading these meditation will bring about purpose for studying the Bible, which is not to know the Bible but to know God. The Bible is not a book of rules but a book of principles which are clearly and simply brought out through these meditations. We get to know God through His Word, His spirit, our experiences and through prayer. May you be blessed!!" />
