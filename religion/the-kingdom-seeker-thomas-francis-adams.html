  <title>The Kingdom Seeker - Thomas Francis Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This critically acclaimed book by the holiest man ever born in America - the first Black captain of a White athletic team in world history and at a Christian high school and among the greatest track and field athletes of all time pound-per-pound - is about how the author predicted the record-breaking hurricane season of 2005 ten months in advance to George Bush, Vladimir Putin, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Ismar Schorsch, David Posner, Ariel Sharon, Pope John Paul II, Michael Bloomberg, the Clintons, Raymond Kelly, senator Charles Schumer, and numerous others after claiming to these very same people both to be the greatest man Jesus ever knew and to have been killed (see 1 Corinthians 15:12-22) more than twenty times over the previous two decades by Satan and his murderous band of sinners, many of whom are gay men whom the author despises with a passion exactly because they always have a plan as regards a womans only pride and joy  her Christian husband - as such men are extremely rare, holy, and enormously special! In fact, such men are gods or kings. Mr. Adams has the Christian gift of prophecy and has done so accurately many, many times since 2005, all proving that Mr. Adams is indeed a very close friend of the Creator of the universe - a righteous man or prophet of the living God and akin to a Christian Vishnu, the ancient destroyer of worlds. The author has not fornicated or done drugs in nearly thirty years, hence his claim of sainthood. The better of people are great which is why you should always take their advice.  The book contains two proofs of Gods existence in the universe by likely the greatest lay theologian of all time  of the ruthless connection between science and religion, one of which Sir Isaac Newton almost discovered over five hundred years ago. What Isaac Newton could not, Tom Adams, an inner-city, Black, child now a man, has done twice over. What the world truly needs is more baby-power and this book brings it in force. Baby-power are the facts that truth, beauty, love, faithfulness, and innocence are universal languages, unlike sin, and are such because saints, although rare,  are real too. The book also adduces the secret of the only way known to the angels of heaven to create value or generate wealth  something every C.E.O. will need to know, especially in these volatile financial times - a secret that will make the book&#39;s readers billionaires within their lifetimes, guaranteed, assuming they are still young. According to the Holy Spirit, this book is the most perfect non-fiction title ever written and at this by what amounts to an almost completely unpracticed, neophyte, scribbler, him being more an engineer by temperament. Kirkus Discoveries says of The Kingdom Seeker: the Diary of Saint Thomas the Divine, in a mixed review:.beautiful,  surprisingly well written, competent religious rant,  and says that it, captures the rhythms of common speech in a startlingly precise and perceptive manner that recalls Jack Kerouac, and says that  any other books this man writes assuming he forgets about religion will be well worth reading. Many kings and righteous men have either died in battle or been assassinated, but this is a book by a king that has defeated death over and over again for the last three decades and for this reason you must buy it immediately, because out of Africa come kings too. Why read any book that isnt written by a prophet of the living God? It would, of course, be nice if Jesus Himself had written books. I, like anyone else that has good sense, am not very excited about reading anyone&#39;s books but His or seeing anyone&#39;s performances but His. But this is obviously to be short sighted. You should buy this book right now not only because it is very, very good but also because it is very, very important. This book is cheaper and earns its author the highest royalty possible anywhere only if purchased directly from this site. Be warned that the title of this book is not &quot;Pagan Hordes of Israel,&quot; so this a book that many in America will not like!  Any Christian that ever fails or isn&#39;t wealthier than Bill Gates at birth is under attack, but you have to be one of the real ones to have it this way. There are at least three kinds of failures in life: The first kind doesn&#39;t believe in himself when he obviously has the talent; the second and more common kind believes in and relies upon only himself but not God; and the third kind doesn&#39;t believe in, utilize, adequately compensate, or even acknowledge an obvious winner; we the gods know this and that all three kinds are losers! Everybody should simply ask God for wisdom, insight, understanding, discernment, and good sense like I did when I was a nine-year-old boy, and He will surely give you these things. You guys are the ones that have to put in my cause for beatification with the Vatican; I can&#39;t do this myself!
