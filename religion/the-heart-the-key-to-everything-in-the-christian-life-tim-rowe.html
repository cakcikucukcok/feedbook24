  <title>The Heart: The Key to Everything In the Christian Life - Tim Rowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We need to recover a truth that has been all but lost in modern-day Christianity. It has been buried for too long, and it is too valuable to be forgotten. This life-changing truth is that the heart is the key to everything in the Christian life. The heart is the wellspring of all our actions, emotions, motives, and character. Everything we are, everything we say, and everything we do flows directly from the heart. In The Heart-The Key to Everything in the Christian Life, believers will discover how the heart is central to spiritual growth and how it will help us better reflect the image of Christ in a fallen world. The heart is the key to our service and obedience to the Father. The heart is the key to the purity and depth of our worship, praise, and love of God. It is time the Christian church once again teaches a proper understanding of the heart so that we can fully embrace and manifest the life of Christ within us." />
