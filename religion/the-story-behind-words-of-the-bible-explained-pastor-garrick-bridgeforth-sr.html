  <title>The Story Behind Words of the Bible Explained - Pastor Garrick Bridgeforth Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was born in Brooklyn, New York.  A child with no father. He passed away when I was one year old, but I went on with life. My mother has six kids. Yes, I was brought up in a group home till I was twelve, moved to Brooklyn to live with my biological mother, and have been with her ever since. Life was hard as a teenager. There were many drugs in my life, anger and resentment to all for the loss of my father, and the homelessness I had to endure. But God, amen, he called me to ministry service at the age of fourteen. I was brought up in the church but backslid for I wanted to live a life with women and drugs, so my nickname was Mr. Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll. This life turned me into a bad person with a good heart. I was strung out on crack cocaine and alcohol for three years; but God stepped in, took me out of the abandoned buildings I was sleeping in, and now gave me more than I ever had, because God saw my heart and saved me in 1995 at the Helping Hands Ministry under Pastor Randolph Ferdinand. There I learned how to pray in the spirit, how to believe in God to remove my hurt. There I heard God teach me his laws, and he told me what he wanted me to do. So I grew in the Lord with wisdom, finished the program, obtained a job, worked hard, got married, and became a pastor of the House of Prayer under Apostle Gladis Dugue. There I was blessed by God with a ministry, and I became a Sunday school teacher. I have my associates degree in management and my bachelors degree in science in religion, and I prayed, and God showed me the words in the Bible. He said, You must teach on every word in the Bible before you leave this earth. I began reading the words, and the Holy Spirit guided me into understanding the meaning of the words in the Bible for everyday life. None of the meanings are from the dictionaryall from God to me to you. 
I would like to thank my wife, Noreen Bridgeforth, who inspired me, my son; Apostle Dugue; Apostle Tyrone Monroe; and House of Prayer, an anointed new beginning where I teach Sunday school. I would like to thank my grandfather Willie Bridgeforth Sr. and my father, Robert, and my mother, Marie Bridgeforth. Thank you to all my family and friends at Helping Hands Ministry and Pastor Randolph Ferdinand." />
