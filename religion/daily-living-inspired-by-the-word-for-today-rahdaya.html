  <title>Daily Living Inspired by the Word for Today - Rahdaya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers all wrongs (Proverbs 10:12). True love forgives, regardless of the contravention, because it transcends mistreatment. So, what is your process for forgiveness? Is it conditional, based on the way you are treated, or is it unconditional? Hatred has no hope but to stir up discord and rally a defense. However, love looks at being wronged as an opportunity to replace insult with encouragement. Love seeks to lead everyone into a better place of health and happiness.
Indeed, hatred is not at home in a heart of love. It sows dissension, while love plants peace. It embraces aggression, while love cuddles compassion. Hate stirs up, but love calms down. How do you handle those who are hard to be around? Perhaps out of love you serve them. Its better to seek to serve, rather than be served.
The many trials and tribulations, Rahdaya has encounter in her life, she chooses to seek the word daily to help her understand who she is or was. She believes that if it had not been for the Word she may not be where she is today. Life will teach us many things, including love and hatred, she could have hated those who brought harm to her, yet she decided to love them where they were, and through prayer and forgiveness, she is able to move on with her life, without hatred in her heart. Her story in this book is not about what she went through but how she got through.
