  <title>I Know that My Redeemer Lives: Suffering and Redemption in the Book of Job - Ronald P. Hesselgrave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book of Job has captured the imagination of Christians and non-Christians alike. In this study, Ronald Hesselgrave shows how the personal story of Job&#39;s intense struggle with suffering is representative of the pain and vexation within the entire creation, and how Job&#39;s eventual healing and restoration in the context of his relationship to God is connected to the &quot;grand narrative&quot; of God&#39;s purpose to redeem humanity and defeat evil in the world. He explores the themes of creation, evil, lament, justice, and God&#39;s sovereignty, grace, and redemption within the separate speeches in Job and against the backdrop of wisdom literature as a whole.  A further concern of this study is with the pastoral or practical value of the book of Job, both for caregivers and those who may themselves be going through the valley of deep trauma and suffering. Dr. Hesselgrave brings together theological, social, and psychological insights in a way that deepens our understanding of suffering and provides the basis for a more holistic and comprehensive response to the needs of those who suffer. A final summary of the implications of Job for a practical theology of suffering is given in the conclusion." />
