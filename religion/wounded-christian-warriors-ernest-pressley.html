  <title>Wounded Christian Warriors - Ernest Pressley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I pray that you have been encouraged to get back into the race for the battle for righteousness. I pray that you get wisdom and understanding to what caused your wounds. If you do not know what caused them you will not know how to pray effectively to get specific result that you are praying to accomplish. Ask yourself these three questions: number one - were your wounds self-affected by being disobedient to HIS Word? Number two - were your wounds caused by trials and tribulation through the testing of your faith? Number three - were they caused by attacks from Satan and his demons? If you know the wounds were self-affected by acts of disobedience then pray for forgiveness and receive HIS mercy and grace (Psalm 103:3). If it is by trials and the testing of your faith then pray for strength and rebuke fear out of your life and be encouraged by HIS every Word (1 Corinthians 16:13). If they are by attacks of Satan and his demons then rebuke them and bind them by speaking the Word of GOD with boldness and authority in JESUS name (Ephesians 6:10-18). Always be on guard and never let your guard down by keeping on your spiritual armor at all times. 
Take appropriate responses to the wounds you have received by being a prepared people in GODs Word on this earth. We must transform our lives to GODs Holy Will. We must have a prescribed rule of conduct or action toward our everyday living. Know that whatever causes your wounds, no matter how deep it may be, it should never replace the love of GOD in your heart. HE knows what you are going through and HE knows how to fix it!
Now pray this prayer: Dear Heavenly Father please forgive me for not trusting in You and doubting Your love for me. Renew my spirit Lord with the Spirit of Wisdom that I may get understanding. Lord give me a hunger and a thirst after Your righteousness and may I always be aware of Your presence with fear and humbleness. I will confess now: Im fearless, strong and fully persuaded in my faith. Im an Ultimate Warrior here on this earth for the Kingdom of GOD in JESUS name." />
