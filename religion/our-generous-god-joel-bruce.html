  <title>Our Generous God - Joel Bruce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;YOU ARE RICH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 8:9 says, Yet for your sake [Christ] became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. But what does that mean? What does it mean that we have become rich through Christ? In Our Generous God, author Joel Bruce explores how God has made us rich in Christ and demonstrates how generous God has been to us through Him. Our God has abundantly blessed His children. If you are in Christ, you are truly rich, because God has lavished His gifts on you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, youll discover the five gifts you receive as a follower of Christ: salvation, adoption, spiritual family, position as an heir, and an inheritance. Any one of those gifts alone would be incredibly valuable, but we are given all five gifts when we receive Christ. And each of those gifts is yours, free of charge. You receive them when you place your faith in Christ. The gifts we have are much more valuable than any material possession we could own. Our gifts from God are priceless and eternal.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many Christ followers go through life thinking they are poor. Or they keep hoping for the day when they will become rich. But as youll discover in Our Generous God, your Father in heaven has already made you far richer in things that matter. In fact, He has generously given to you because you are His child and He loves you. Our God has given us so much in Christ.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you read Our Generous God, youll come away with a greater appreciation for who God is. Your Father is incredibly generous to you, because His generosity is an expression of His very nature. And you have received so much from Him because He is generous.&lt;/p&gt;" />
