  <title>The Mystery Mission of Salvation in Christ Jesus - Dr. Ibim Alfred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the past twenty years, I have thought and developed an interest in what I call the mystery mission of salvation in Christ Jesus. This curiosity has intensified over the past three years, and I am compelled by the divine spirit of Christ Jesus to put my belief and faith in ink on paper. Apostle Paul, the greatest theologian, stated, Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach (1 Cor. 9:16). Like Paul, I am writing this book not of my own choice but of necessity. I believe I have been entrusted with this assignment to unveil the mystery mission of salvation in Christ Jesus.
Paul stated, For Christs love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died (2 Cor. 5:14). The love shown by Christ Jesus (Gal. 2:20, Rom. 8:3538) is the model of authentic existence and compels believers like Paul, who thought that he had no choice but to imitate the selflessness of Christ Jesus to preach the Gospel of salvation in Christ Jesus. As a believer in the Savior, our Lord, and God Christ Jesus, I am obliged to write this book about the Son of God who wrought salvation to the universe through his birth on the first Christmas Day, his mission on earth for about three years, his cruel death on the cross on the first Good Friday, and his ultimate resurrection on the first Easter Sunday morning.
My purpose in this book is not to boast on human intelligence or ability; on the contrary, it is to show the love of Christ Jesus who condescended and descended humbly from his divine heavenly city to this sinful earthly city in order to bring eternal salvation to all those who believe in him.
I do hope and pray ardently and fervently that this book might help just one person to come to know salvation in Christ Jesus for the first time or open the spiritual eye and mind of a believer to have a deeper and more holy understanding of the amazing grace and love of Christ Jesus, who brings salvation to humanity by his wonderful and mysterious mission of salvation, which is unveiled in this book. That person in either situation could be you." />
