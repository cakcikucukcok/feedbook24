  <title>The Circumcised Heart - Marilyn O. Flower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Circumcised Heart: Ready, Imperfect, Softened, Transparent is based on the authors life and describes how biblical literacy transformed her heart and led to a much stronger and deeper relationship with God. Specific personal memoirs which describe how God worked in her life drawing her closer to him as she became more dependent upon him portray steady character growth. Angry with God because he had not answered her prayers at times as she wished, she was unable to deny him or remain angry, because he was so active in her life, revealing himself miraculously and mysteriously at times. Through his perfect love and the Bible, God showed her how a relationship with him lasts a lifetime and is for eternity. God used the authors heartache to drive her to seek him and through everyday occurrences made himself visible and ever-present, so that now she relies constantly on him, his Word, and the Holy Spirit for comfort, protection, and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
