  <title>The Integrity of the Upright Shall Guide Them… - Lora T. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first of a 5 book series on the subject of integrity, taken from the author&#39; original book entitled &quot;Let Integrity And Uprightness Preserve Me...&quot;.  It was created as the result of her obedience to her pastor Bishop Dr. Dana C. Head Sr.&#39; instructions to break down the larger book, so it will be easier to digest.      
Better is the poor that walks in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. Proverbs 19:1
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty who hath vexed my soul; 
All the while my breath is in me,
and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
God forbid that I should justify you; till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
Job 27: 1-6
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;
Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond of free.
Ephesians 6:5-8" />
