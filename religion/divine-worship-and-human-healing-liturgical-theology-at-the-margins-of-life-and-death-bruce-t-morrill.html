  <title>Divine Worship and Human Healing: Liturgical Theology at the Margins of Life and Death - Bruce T. Morrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would many believers consider a wake or funeral an act of worship? What does it mean to say that in anointing the sick or administering Viaticum to the dying humans are healed? Such questions plumb the biblical and traditional depths of the paschal mystery. Just as Jesus&#39; ministry at the social-religious margins revealed the center of his faith in God&#39;??s reign, so also the church&#39;s ministry to sickness and death reveals much about the baptismal and Eucharistic worship so central to its entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Divine Worship and Human Healing&lt;/i&gt; Bruce Morrill turns to the rites serving the sick, dying, deceased, and grieving to show why sacramental liturgy is so fundamental to the life of faith. Readers will appreciate both his compelling narratives from actual pastoral experience and his engagement with biblical, theological, historical, and social-scientific resources.
