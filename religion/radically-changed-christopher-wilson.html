  <title>Radically Changed - Christopher Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I was inspired to write the book RADICALLY CHANGED as a result of my being exposed to people in the downtown eastside skid row of a large city. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Men and women come to the downtown eastside skid row with problems that often seem insurmountable. Many have addictions while, others are traumatized or victimized with little self esteem or self worth. They try to drown their sorrows with mind altering substances. Others have horrible nightmares as a reminder of something often horrendous that had happened to them or to a loved one. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are those who have done something which they regret. They are sorry but often plagued with memories of what they have done or failed to do. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Men and women abused and beaten down are appalled by what they have suffered at the hands of people they trusted and respected. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some contemplate suicide in order to end their dependance on drugs or memories which impede their ability to function adequately in society. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;the Mission, on the worst street in the country, is a gathering place for those who are plagued with these problems. It is a safe place in the bowels of a hellish existence for many who are forced to live and interact in this setting and sub culture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When they enter the Mission they feel the caring and concern of the staff and the students from the Bible College. These are loving persons ready to brighten their day, listen to their sordid stories and tell them about Jesus who is their hope. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Those who respond to the invitation and go to the Bible College are rewarded with knowledge and insight into methods of recovering and becoming new creations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many have become radically changed. Their life changing adventures are exposed in the pages of this inspirational book. &lt;/P&gt;" />
