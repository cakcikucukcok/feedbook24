  <title>What Your Eyes Have Not Seen - Michael W. Cadry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains very important information for everyone alive today, especially as the millennium and beyond are looming toward us all. Armageddon and the Second Coming of Christ will be very soon in the future, although myself or anyone else on earth can say that they know in which day that will happen. This is because Jesus told us himself, in the New Testament, that no man knows that day and hour, except our Father in heaven. I can attest, though, that I have had a number of angelic visits and also visions from the Lord, and in these pages, I relate those experiences. I do not ask that you believe all or any part of my book. What has happened to me has been nearly unbelievable to myself. I cannot expect you to believe simply by my words. All that I do ask, though, is that you read and listen for your own self, and you will receive all proof of my claims in the near future. It is my hope that you will have this information when you most need itduring Armageddon. Many of you will fare much better by far to have this information now, while you can study and read it, than later, when earthquakes and all sorts of havoc are happening around some of you. Always remember that, even though there will be a time of havoc, afterward the Lord will return for the resurrection, and life will be very beautiful in heaven and on earth. God be with each of you during these times and the times yet to come. Amen." />
