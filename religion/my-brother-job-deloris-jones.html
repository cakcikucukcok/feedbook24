  <title>My Brother Job - Deloris Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do we trust God in tests that cause excruciating pain that affects the inner man; pain from physical afflictions; bad memories or unforgiveness, from abuse that hinders us from going forth in the Lord? How do we conquer Satans influences that try to overshadow us in our weakness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemy may try to destroy us through pain from wounds, but you must go through and seek healing. When knocked around, beaten down, and left bruised, the wound can become inflamed. Inflammation causes the heart to deteriorate, which becomes ineffective and leads to death. Spiritual healing is important for growth and allows the heart to be purified by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resist the enemy of the mind and ask God to restore. Walk in obedience and forget those things that are behind you. As a chosen vessel by God, the road to eternal life includes suffering, persecution, and attacks. Job was challenged in his body and mind, but his faith in God did not waver. A test removed the impurities from the heart that reject the truth of God. Jobs vindication came through God who was his defense against the enemy. Hidden in the secret place of the most high, only God could examine and rightly judge him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job stood firm in God. Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him. We are to glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance (Roman 5:3).Those who are kept by Gods power to the end of their lives shall have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
