  <title>A Journey in God’S Embrace - Dianne Wood Halloran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I couldnt believe this was happening to me! I was sitting in church with my parents. I was seventeen years old; I had my whole life ahead of me. I told God, This is dumb. I wasnt going to accept it and let it bring me down.&lt;br /&gt;
Join the author as she journeys through an illness that will challenge her and discover how she fights discouragement with determination and faith. She learns to deal with her limitations, finds love, and faces an even bigger challenge when someone she loves develops AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through it all, her faith grows as she realizes just how family and friends are her strength and support. Was all this Gods plan for her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a story! I couldnt stop reading it. You have done an outstanding job telling your story.  God often leads us in ways that we dont understand at first, but then it becomes clear to usif we believe. &lt;br /&gt;
- Donna Hillhouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest gift we can give to the world around us is using our life experience to help others. By writing this book, this is what Dianne has done. As we read it, we have to ask ourselves, Could we have done as well?&lt;br /&gt;
