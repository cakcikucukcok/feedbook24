  <title>Original Design: Set Free to be Who God Created - Denise Buss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you the person God created you to be or the person Satan molded you into?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Bible tells us that we are made in the image and likeness of God. Unfortunately we have an adversary, the devil, roaming around like a lion seeking whom he may devour. Most of the time he doesn&amp;rsquo;t literally kill us, but takes us off the path of God by concealing our true identity. Satan attacks when we are young, when our hearts are soft and vulnerable&amp;mdash;easily molded.&amp;nbsp; Whether we grow up in the Church or come to Christ later in life, we don&amp;rsquo;t realize we&amp;rsquo;ve been altered because much of Satan&amp;rsquo;s work is either subtle or completely invisible. Fear not. We have a Deliverer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In Christ you have redemption from all of the devil&amp;rsquo;s work, including the impact it has on your heart, the reactions it produces in you, and even his work that becomes a part of who you are.&amp;rdquo; That is what God spoke to Denise Buss, author of the new book &lt;em&gt;Original Design: Set Free to be Who God Created. &lt;/em&gt;This book is&amp;nbsp;packed with revelations from God on how Satan uses an array of influences such as our family, our culture, and even the Church to wound and scar us&amp;mdash;change us from who God intended us to be. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. Through Denise&amp;rsquo;s journey you&amp;rsquo;ll see how God&amp;rsquo;s mighty hand reaches forth to unbury secrets, gently uproot lies, and heal wounds in our hearts, thereby setting us free from Satan&amp;rsquo;s grip and restoring us back to God&amp;rsquo;s original design.&lt;/p&gt;" />
