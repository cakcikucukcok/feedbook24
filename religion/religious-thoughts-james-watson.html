  <title>Religious Thoughts - James Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Religion is a small word, but it has a huge impact on both life and death. In &lt;i&gt;Religious
Thoughts, author James Watson takes a look at the history of religion through the years and delves into how the various manmade religions were formed and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this historical exploration of religious texts, Watson addresses a host of questions addressing religion, its origins, and its mutations. &lt;i&gt;Religious Thoughts&lt;/i&gt; asks:&lt;/p&gt;
	Why, in the beginning, were just three major religions formed?&lt;/br&gt;
	Why were the minor religionssuch as Protestant, Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterianstarted?&lt;/br&gt;
	Did these religions coincide with or cause directly or indirectly major military conflicts?&lt;/br&gt;
	How did religion become so diverse and corrupt?&lt;/br&gt;
	Why and how did the manmade religions evolve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly researched, &lt;i&gt;Religious Thoughts&lt;/i&gt; asks a wide range of thought-provoking questions and presents Watsons opinions and concerns. It presents a historical time travel through centuries of religious changes, documenting the history of the Abrahamic religions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
