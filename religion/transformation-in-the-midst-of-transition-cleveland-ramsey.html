  <title>Transformation in the Midst of Transition - Cleveland Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Naturally, as Christians, we are often perplexed and distressed by the many diverse storms, trials, and fires that we encounter on a daily basis, but God is desirous that we comprehend that our trials are preparing and positioning us for our next level of blessings. The lessons that our present storms or fires are teaching now are necessary prerequisites for the new season that is about to come. I strongly believe that how you master your now will ultimately determine how you respond to your tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous hidden blessings in your storm, and if you would take the time to appreciate, digest, and evaluate them, you can discover that your storm can easily transition you closer to your purpose and destiny. Transformation In The Midst of Transition teaches you how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace the benefits and opportunities of your storm by allowing it to transform you and transition you into a new level of spiritual growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize it as a coaching guide to help you navigate effectively through the contemptuous storms and fiery trials of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appreciate the lessons of your past and understand that there is more to your life than what you are currently going through, by encouraging you to focus rather on where and what God is taking you to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage and cope with the new devils at your new levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survive and prosper from the storms that you will encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehend that your storms were designed with your maturity in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyze the storms in your life and how to discover the purpose of each storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your trials are designed to mature and refine you, so do not run away from them or allow yourself to get all impulsively before the work that was intended is accomplished. Your trials are meant to bless and reposition you to another level where you learn how to praise God in the midst of your storm, and subsequently for the storm! When you look back you realize that the storms were designed with your maturity in mind! You learn how to give God thanks in all of your circumstances, knowing that you will come out better when you were tempted to be bitter!&lt;/p&gt;" />
