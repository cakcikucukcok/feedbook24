      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A practical guidebook to the Kabbalah, an ancient mystical tradition which is currently enjoying a resurgence of interest among powerful female role models such as Madonna and Roseanne Barr. The resurgence of interest in the Kabbalah particularily among women is thanks to the universal appeal of the teachings which reach beyond the Jewish tradition where it was born into powerful spiritual truths.&lt;br /&gt;The Kabbalah links the Western and Eastern spriitual traditions and it influences tarot, astrology, numerology and magic as it embraces the growth of the soul through the eternal Tree of Life.&lt;br /&gt;In this accessible book Vivianne Crowley, who has studied the Kabbalah for many years, makes the tradition available to people from all backgrounds and faiths. The book combines a theoretical explanation of the system with a practical system for using the Kabbalah in our everyday lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Woman&#39;s Kabbalah&lt;/em&gt;  is a refreshingly modern approach to a respected ancient wisdom. It is a source book of ideas and a handbook to help you in your personal and spiritual growth. It tells you not only about theory, but also about practice. Each new aspect of Kabbalah is accompanied by spiritual and practical exercises that draw on your imagination, stimulate your creativity, inspire you to spiritual insight, and facilitate your personal growth.&lt;br /&gt;The Paranormal, the new ebook series from F&amp;W Media International Ltd, resurrecting rare titles, classic publications and out-of-print texts, as well as new ebook titles on the supernatural - other-worldly books for the digital age.
