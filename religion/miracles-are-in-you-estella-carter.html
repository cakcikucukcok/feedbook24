  <title>Miracles Are  in You - Estella Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever asked where do Miracles come from?  How do they happen? In this book, you will explore some 20 miracles. These true stories will inspire a sense of great expectancy that God is doing something in the atmosphere. You&#39;ll find treasures to help you know that Miracles Are In You. Because Jesus lives, Miracles live!  
Estella makes it exciting and enjoyable to explore and examine Miracles in our lives. I believe you will begin to see all the miracles around you and become more aware of the miracles which are in you as you read this book. I highly commend to you Miracles are in You.  Dianne Haneke PhD, Professor Emeritus of Literacy Education, near Austin TX.
	Estella Carter is a mother, grandmother, aunt, and a friend to many. She enjoys spending time fishing, crabbing and just being around the ocean. She loves doing different kinds of art work and listening to music. She was a Sunday School Superintendent, teacher, and womens group leader. Estella was ordained in 2003 to the ministry. When God summoned her for another assignment, she dropped every- thing and came to Austin TX, where she currently resides and encourages others to know God is alive and well." />
