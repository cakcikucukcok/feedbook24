  <title>My Romance with God - Peter Christian Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with God tends to be complicated because He knows us only too well while we are limited in our knowledge and to our ignorance of God.  As a result, our bond with Him strains as it weaves in and out of an ambivalent and whimsical love-hate relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for Christians who are confused, lost and entangled in this intricate web with God.  Having our faith constantly challenged, we find ourselves tired and mired in a relationship that seems to be running out of steam.  The daily battles we fight to survive are more than we can handle, let alone having to deal with an unpredictable and unfathomable God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Romance with God chronicles an episode in my life that reveals a glimpse of God.  It captures pieces of an intangible portrait that paints an enigmatic yet vibrant relationship that can prove overwhelming, and yet quenching the thirst and satisfying the hunger of our spirit.  Knowing the Word is good. Understanding it is even better. But living it is best, because it is only by living the Word that one can truly believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that God spoke to me through these pages.  I know that He will also speak to those who read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like Eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint. (Isaiah 40:31)&lt;/p&gt;" />
