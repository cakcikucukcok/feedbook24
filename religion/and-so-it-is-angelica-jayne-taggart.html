Rev. Angelicas messages are a combination of story-telling, enlightened insight, affirmative prayer, and honest communication around what it means to be spirit having a human experience.&lt;br /&gt;
 Danika Dinsmore, author&lt;br /&gt;
Rev. Angelica has inspired me for years with her weekly messages and prayers. What a feast to have so much wisdom in one volume! &lt;br /&gt;
 Rev. Carrie Hunter, Banff, Alberta, Canada&lt;br /&gt;
Open and caring, joyful and sharing are the foundations on which Reverend Angelica builds to inspire us to be the best version of ourselves we can be. I hope you will find as much encouragement and inspiration in this collection of some of her finest messages as I have in reading them over the past ten years.&lt;br /&gt;
 Brad McPhee, Financial Consultant &lt;br /&gt;
Rev. Angelicas Messages are an integral part of my spiritual practice. They are always such a great resource, personally inspiring me with many ideas to contemplate and down to earth inspiration that I often quote in my own presentations.&lt;br /&gt;
 Rev. Lorraine Trout, Saskatoon, SK, Canada&lt;br /&gt;
Rev. Angelica writes with a blend of common sense and spiritual wisdom that is a treasure for beginners and advanced readers alike. She never fails to enlighten, entertain and make me think. I look forward to what she has to say and how she chooses to say it. Her affirmative prayers are pure poetry.&lt;br /&gt;
 Rev. Jane Claypool, author&lt;br /&gt;
 This insightful guide is like having my own practical mystic at my fingertips. Rev Angelica finds and shares extraordinary messages from lifes most ordinary events.&lt;br /&gt;
 Rev. Sandy Shipley, Life Coach &amp; Wedding Officiant&lt;br /&gt;
Rev. Angelica is phenomenal in her highly practical way of presenting Science of Mind principles . Through her teachings I have come to know my hearts desires manifest with as much ease as I allow myself.&lt;br /&gt;
