  <title>Twelve Keys to Unlocking the Secret of Miracles in a Course in Miracles - Bonnie Nack Ed. D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;In His Introduction to A Course in Miracles Jesus says: &#39;This ia Course in Miracles, It is a required Course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you may elect what you want to take at a given time.&quot; There is a purpose to our lives! we are here to learn something about Miracles, and we cannot avoid learning it. The only choice we have is to procrastinate the inevitable. It should be noted, however, the Miracle in A Course in Miracles has a very unique and definition and function.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bonnie Nack is a long time student/teacher of A Course in Miracles who has taken the time to go deeply into her study of the Course and bring forth some of the its most remarkable gems putting them on display. The Course is not easy, but it is oh, so very rewarding once the student begins to apply its principles. By applying these principles, a new way of Thinking and Being is manifest, the light at the end of tunnel is seen, and you know that by following this guide you will indeed find you way Home.
