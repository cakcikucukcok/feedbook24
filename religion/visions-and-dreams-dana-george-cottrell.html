  <title>Visions and Dreams - Dana George Cottrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;People make the decision to become one of Gods believers for many reasons. For some, it is a long process. Then something happens to bring them over the line between doubt and belief, and they become Gods beloved child. In some cases, that something is a prophetic vision or dream. Visions and Dreams: Prophetic Gifts of the Holy Spirit is based on prophetic visions and dreams that author Dana George Cottrell experienced over twenty-three years. At first, those who experience these visions and dreams may be frightened and confused. The author shows there is no reason to be. You will learn receiving, interpreting, and sharing these communications is a maturing process. Without a source to assist someone who just received the gift, the process of interpreting vision and dreams can be quite a struggle. The author shares some of the dreams and visions he has experienced to help you understand and interpret those you experience. Youll also learn how to use those interpretations. After all, if used incorrectly, these gifts will be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have experienced prophetic visions and dreams and want to know more about them, or if you are simply interested in the subject, Visions and Dreams: Prophetic Gifts of the Holy Spirit will help you understand and interpret these special gifts from God. Youll learn there is no reason to fear these signs of Gods love for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
