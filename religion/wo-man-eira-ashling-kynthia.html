      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary, Mother of Jesus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Davids lineage ends with Jesus through Mary, a woman who God has placed above even man, as He permitted Mary to beget a Son, without the seed of man. He bestowed the greatest honor, as a sign of respect, not to man, but to woman, and specifically a woman of a long line of Levite Priests, our blessed Mother Mary, &lt;em&gt;Blessed is she among all women. Blessed is the fruit of her womb, Jesus!&lt;/em&gt; The line of Kings ends with a woman, Mary, so that no others may claim the right to sit upon the throne. Mary is the last to have the inalienable birth right to the throne of Adam. Belief in Jesus gives us an &lt;em&gt;inheritance to the throne&lt;/em&gt;, not because of anything we have done or because of our position in life, but solely because of Jesus and His position promised by God in the very beginning in the book of Genesis.  Ladies, this is the level of respect, honor, and grace which has been, is, and will always be given to women by God.  God recognizes women with precedence and therefore, no other being has any right or authority to usurp that which He has bestowed upon women.  It is time that all of mankind recognize women based on this precedence, granting them equal respect, honor, and dignity in all matters.  For it is written that woman is graced with the power of the Angels (1 Corinthians 11:10, emphasis mine), For this cause ought the woman to have a power on her head because of the angels, which is the authority over womannot mankind (KJV Study Bible, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;" />
