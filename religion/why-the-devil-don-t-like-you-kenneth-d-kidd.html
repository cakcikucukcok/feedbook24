  <title>Why the Devil Don’T Like You - Kenneth D. Kidd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is revelation teaching of what the Holy Spirit revealed to me about why the children of God have so many problems, and trouble with the devil. This book will teach and show you why Satan does not like you. Since you were made in Gods image and likeness, you were made Spirit. God made man to be another speaking Spirit just like Himself. God gave something to man that he did not give to the angels. He gave man the ability to call things that be not as though they were (Romans 4:17). The devil does not have that ability. The thinking of some is that Satan tried to take Gods place, or overthrow God, and take over heaven. That teaching had Lucifer trying to overthrow God in heaven so he could be God. This book explains what really happen. It tells us that Lucifer really did not try to take over heaven. Most importantly it explains Why The Devil Dont Like You!&lt;/p&gt;" />
