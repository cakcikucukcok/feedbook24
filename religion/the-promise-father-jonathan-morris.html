  <title>The Promise - Father Jonathan Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his work as a priest and commentator for FOX News, Father Jonathan Morris has traveled to the troubled spots of the world, meeting with Muslim youth during the rioting in Paris, sitting down with populists at odds with the Church in Venezuela, and investigating human trafficking in Germany. Now Father Jonathan peels back the layers of questions that arise when someone asks, &quot;Why me?&quot; in response to human suffering. With an accessible voice and calming pastoral guidance, Father Jonathan leads readers through each step of suffering&amp;#8212;from doubt and anger to healing and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Promise&lt;/em&gt; comprises three parts, each addressing a step in the process of healing. Part 1, &quot;God on Trial,&quot; speaks to doubts and anger that arise when we suffer and poses tough questions such as &quot;Does God even care?&quot; and &quot;Why should we trust a God who allows innocent suffering?&quot; Part 2 takes the reader on a journey of finding emotional and spiritual healing from suffering. In part 3 Father Jonathan introduces the five &quot;Principles for Freedom-Living.&quot; From living your personal vocation to a step-by-step guide for sketching a plan for your spiritual life, the freedom principles are practical and easily applied to everyday life. Together these five principles have the power to transform what would otherwise be useless suffering into a means of great sanctification and personal fulfillment. While pulling back the layers of philosophy and theology that surround human suffering, Father Jonathan offers not only a deeply spiritual answer but also a practical one to this most fundamental of human questions: Why do we suffer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Promise&lt;/em&gt; not only addresses how to understand and live with suffering, but also poses the toughest question regarding our relationship to God: Why do we suffer under a benevolent God? Father Jonathan delves into how we can heal from the spiritual, emotional, and even physical scars left behind by suffering. &lt;em&gt;The Promise&lt;/em&gt; offers five principles for living a free life, or a life free of the fear that God is not there for us, and offers comfort and hope to those experiencing hard times. &lt;/p&gt;" />
