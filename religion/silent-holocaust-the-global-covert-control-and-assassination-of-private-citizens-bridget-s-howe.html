  <title>Silent Holocaust: The Global Covert Control and Assassination of Private Citizens - Bridget S. Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book describes the worldwide phenomena involving the covert targeting of private citizens by their respective governments.  This is called Organized Vigilante Stalking, or Gangstalking.  Any person can become a victim of this vicious hate crime which results in the destruction of the targeted individual&#39;s relationships, reputation, career, employment and health etc.  The end result may be the covert murder of the target or the targeted individual commits suicide.  There are as many as three million victims in the United States alone, and this is global.  The author takes you on a journey back to the Holocaust and NAZI Germany where a nihilist, fascist mindset paved the way for the murder of 6 million Jews.  Then she reveals how this same NAZI mentality is at work in the world today and is being supported by governments worldwide.  The author also reveals the deceptive tactics employed that persuade innocent people to cooperate with this crime  and also how the church has been involved." />
