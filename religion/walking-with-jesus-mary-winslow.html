  <title>Walking With Jesus - Mary Winslow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Walking With Jesus&amp;nbsp;is a message of meditation based on the Bible and written by Mary Winslow&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Mary Forbes (1774&amp;ndash;1854) had Scots roots but was born and raised in Bermuda and was the only child of Dr. and Mrs George Forbes.&lt;br /&gt;
On September 6, 1791, when she was just 17, she married Army Lieutenant Thomas Winslow of the 47th Regiment. Shortly after this, she came under spiritual convictions and was brought to gospel deliverance while pleading the promise, &amp;ldquo;Ask, and ye shall receive&amp;rdquo;. Christ Himself powerfully told her heart,&amp;ldquo;I am Thy salvation!&amp;rdquo; and she was saved.&lt;br /&gt;
Mary is the mother of Octavius Winslow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a child, Octavius and family would worship at Pentonville Chapel under the ministry of Rev. Thomas Sheppard. During this time of his life, he suffered from what seemed to be a life threatening illness. While staying in Twickenham, a nurse accidentally administered an incorrect medicine that doctors would later say would have killed ten men. But it was in God&amp;rsquo;s providence that he would live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Octavius&amp;rsquo;s father was from a wealthy family but by 1815, following his retirement from the army, he suffered ill-health and the loss of his fortune due to one of several national financial disasters that occurred in this period. A decision was soon made to move to America, but before Mr. Winslow could join his wife and children in New York, he died. At the same time, their youngest child died too. Octavius was but 7 years old." />
