  <title>Broken to be Blessed - Louise Beaubrun Macaluso PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Up until the age of sixteen, the life of Louise Beaubrun-Macaluso was for the most part idyllic. Being raised by two loving parents, with her father as the bread-winner and her mother a stayat-home mom, she and her sisters grew up in a home that many in her native country would call privileged. However, her life was about to take a painful turn of losses and tragedies. The first tragedy in Beaubrun-Macaluso&amp;rsquo;s life hit just eight days after her sixteenth birthday, when her father was killed by an 18-wheels truck. Such untimely and tragic death of her beloved father seemed like more than she and her family could ever be able to endure. Unfortunately, three years later tragedy of an even higher proportion struck again. Eight months after Beaubrun-Macaluso immigrated to the United States, to live with some relatives, their house caught on fire while they were sleeping. Though they woke up, the seven of them who slept on the second floor were trapped in the burning house. Upon waking up from an over a month-long coma, she slowly began to piece together the dire consequences the house fire had on her physically and emotionally. Having to face such devastating turning point in her life, she endeavored to step into this new and uncertain journey. In her book (Broken To Be Blessed: A Turning Point), Beaubrun-Macaluso relays her experience, from her painful recovery to an ultimate redemption no one saw coming.&lt;/p&gt;" />
