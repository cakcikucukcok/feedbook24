  <title>Look Deeper - Karyn Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a story to tell. Have you ever met someone who has skated through life without falling down, and without bruises from the fall? Have you ever met someone who has not been scarred by difficult experiences or painful events? Have you ever met someone who has not experienced disappointment, or a broken heart? Truth be told, that person doesnt exist.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world that is at once beautiful and broken. So it is not surprising that our lives are both beautiful and broken, sometimes more broken than beautiful. In &lt;em&gt;Look Deeper&lt;/em&gt;, writer Karyn Montgomery shares a collection of reflections drawing from surprising, difficult, and painful experiences in her own life that have led to the discovery of unexpected gifts. She recounts a story of resilience and recovery, hope and healing that will inspire and encourage you, leading you to the discovery of unexpected gifts that will transform your own life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have it all together. Maybe not. Look deeper.&lt;/p&gt;" />
