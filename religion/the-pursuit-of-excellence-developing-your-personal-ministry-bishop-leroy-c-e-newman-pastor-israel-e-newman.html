  <title>The Pursuit of Excellence Developing Your Personal Ministry - Bishop Leroy C. E. Newman, Pastor Israel E. Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about building Christian character and the development of ones personal ministries, which includes integrity, commitment, dedication, and devotion. It assures believers that God will never take them any place in their ministries where they are forced to retreat. 
Bishop Newman 
Ministry is one of the most important assignments our Savior has commissioned to the church. Each member has an assigned purpose or call for the cause of Christ. How seriously you take that calling will determine your level of maturity as a believer. My father and I have devoted this text to helping believers achieve spiritual maturity. 
Timothy Keller, in his book Ever Good Endeavor, says, A story begins when something knocks life off balance. Then the progresses, of the plot thickens, as the protagonists struggle to restore that balance and peace while antagonistic forces block and resist them. Finally, the story ends as the struggle results in either the restoration of balance or the failure to recover it. Thats a good story! 
As baptized believers, our lives have been knocked off balance by the wiles of the devil, and by grace, we are seeking restoration through the blood of Jesus, who was wounded for our transgression and bruised for our iniquities. Our strategy for restoration and development toward Christian maturity and Christlikeness must be based on our commitment, dedication, and devotion to the Will of God.
