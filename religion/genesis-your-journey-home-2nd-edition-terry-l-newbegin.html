  <title>Genesis: Your Journey Home, 2Nd Edition - Terry L. Newbegin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Genesis: Your Journey Home is a groundbreaking book that goes far beyond the usual levels of biblical interpretations, and the ideas taught by religion that are difficult to understand. It bypasses word definition, root studies, historical explanations, and the ideas taught by religion that are difficult to understand but are important. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book examines the first twenty-five chapters, verse by verse, exploring and revealing the deeper metaphysical (beyond the literal) meaning of the text. Most people know that there are multiple levels of truth contained within the Bible, but until now none have brought forth the ultimate Truth hidden within the mundane, semi-historical writings. Rather than creating new doctrines, this book gently peels back ALL levels of dogmatic views to reveal the true core essence of God, humanity, and the nature of reality. Deep within the ancient biblical text is found the true story (record) of creation, the reason for our very existence, and the history of All That IS. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for those that are searching for authenticity, purpose, and a sense that truth lies somewhere beyond religious teachings but who are reluctant to discard the inherent value of scripture. This book brings comfort, personal empowerment, a new understanding of God, and fosters a renewed sense of responsibility for life. It is a book whose time has come at last, as it brings humanity to a deeper understanding of God and a realization of their ultimate purpose.&lt;p&gt;" />
