  <title>Prayer Simplified - Adetona Samuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The aim of this book is to keep readers in the know of what prayer is and keep its many facets as SIMPLE as possible.  It is also written to fuel the prayer life of Christians (new converts and nominal) having challenges with prayers.  All broad topics can be made simple if they are broken down into sub topics or items.  Prayer becomes simple as we know the basics and put what we know into practice over a period of time.  Prayer as a topic is inexhaustible as the learning process is continuous. Prayer can sometimes be abused as well as under utilised.  This book helps put issues in the right perspectives. 
This book is a condensation of over fifteen years of lessons learnt during personal prayers.  
It addresses prayer topics such as 
	Spiritual Tools for Prayer
	Natural Tools for Prayer
	Prayer Maintenance culture
	When to Stop Praying
	When to Start Praying
	Hearing God After Prayers
	Hindrances  To Prayer
	Different kinds of Prayers
	Prayer Songs
	Learning How to Pray
	Prayer Times
	Reasons for Prayer
	Prayer Hindrances
	Prayer List and Records
	Prayer Venues
	Prayer Postures
	Balancing Prayer and Work
	Duration of Prayer
	Prayer Intensity
	Prayer Groups and Agreement
	Prayer and Fasting
	Prayer Levels (Level 1  Level 5)
	How To Develop Prayer Points
	Biblical  Prayer Legends
	Contemporary Prayer Legends
	Lots more." />
