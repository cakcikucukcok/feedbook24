  <title>Gathering Together: Baptists at Work in Worship - Rodney Wallace Kennedy, Derek C. Hatch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Concerned to think intentionally about liturgy in Baptist life and thought, this book aims to address the practices of Christian worship in a theological light, examining how each brings individual Christian believers and communities of faith to a greater understanding and embodiment of the gospel. In this mode, worship becomes a seamless garment that forms disciples of Christ and opens out toward the world. In short, theology, worship, and mission all intersect in the liturgical life of the body of Christ. In addition to theological engagement with liturgical practices, Gathering Together links reflection to praxis by offering sample patterns as a guide for reenvisioning the shape of Baptist (and other free church) worship." />
