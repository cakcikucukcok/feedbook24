  <title>A Voice to Be Heard - Richard Higginson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christian entrepreneurs are at the heart of the church’s mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are dynamic, innovative followers of Christ who are making a major contribution to our society through the companies they run, the products they make and the people they influence. A Voice to Be Heard explains and celebrates their work, mostly through their own words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theological educator Richard Higginson and former retail entrepreneur Kina Robertshaw have worked together on this ground-breaking study, based on interviews with fifty entrepreneurs. Exploring issues of vision, creativity, relationships, stewardship, integrity, prayer and perseverance, they show how people running their own businesses are exercising crucial roles in building God’s kingdom. With the church’s encouragement, they have the potential to do even more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Practical, biblical, informative . . . this book conveys vividly the voices of Christian entrepreneurs.’ Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘This book is a treasure. From car dealerships to toy stores, A Voice to Be Heard visits particular entrepreneurs at work and reveals their leadership lessons for us all.’ Eve Poole &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘This book has truth with flesh on. It is a delicious mixture of story and biblical reflection . . . a truly inspiring read.’ Dr R. Paul Stevens&lt;/p&gt;" />
