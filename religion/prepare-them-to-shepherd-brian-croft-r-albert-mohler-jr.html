  <title>Prepare Them to Shepherd - Brian Croft, R. Albert Mohler, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Are You &lt;EM&gt;Called&lt;/EM&gt; to Ministry?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Those who are involved in full-time ministry often say they have been “called” to do what they do. But what does that mean? Who does the “calling,” and how is it received?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;EM&gt;Prepare Them to Shepherd&lt;/EM&gt;, pastor Brian Croft unpacks the biblical model for preparing individuals for full-time ministry. In the past, training and sending individuals into full-time pastoral ministry and missionary work was viewed as the responsibility of the local church. Today, much of that responsibility has been delegated to Bible colleges, seminaries, and parachurch and mission organizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The aim of &lt;EM&gt;Prepare Them to Shepherd&lt;/EM&gt; is to challenge local churches to recover the biblical model for ministerial training and assume responsibility to identify and prepare gifted and godly individuals for service in Christ’s body. Part of the Practical Shepherding series of books, this insightful book provides pastors and ministry leaders with the practical help they need to test, train, affirm, and send those who are called into ministry.&lt;/P&gt;" />
