  <title>A Journey to the Pulpit - Grant C. McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My parents love their pastor, but they rarely get much from his sermons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why live with word salad, rabbit trails and bouncing around like a ball in a pin ball machine when you can work smarter, not harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank pastors a country church. His positive attitude and effective preaching create an air of expectation for something great each week. As a multi-vocational pastor he rarely experiences the Saturday night panic and arrives at the pulpit ready to preach.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;George, a loner, also pastors a country church. The services are lack luster, he is approaching burn out and he questions his call to a pulpit ministry. George just toughs it out thinking it to be more godly. Saturday night is repetitively panic time and Sunday often brings excuses. George does not understand that he might need more preparation than does his sermons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank recognized his need for help, and found a mentor. He learned to establish the purpose of the sermon first, match it with divine inspiration and have others help gather materials. This reduced preparation time, balanced his work schedule, family time, self-care and sermon preparation. By working on his illustrations and delivery, he could take a lesser quality sermon and turn it into a great event.&lt;/p&gt;" />
