  <title>Toward the Better Country: Church Closure and Resurrection - L. Gail Irwin, David C. Schoen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At a time when pews are not as full as they used to be, many churches are struggling to stay open. But no matter how creative or hard-working, some congregations are unable to revitalize their ministry. Is it time to talk about closing your church? Are there any other options for your future? Toward the Better Country tells the stories of real congregations that have faced a significant downsizing, merger, or closure and found positive ways to move forward in ministry. While no local church is meant to live forever, congregations that have chosen to faithfully complete their ministry are finding hope in the new ventures born from passing on their spiritual and material legacies.  Based on over thirty interviews with church leaders from various denominations, this practical resource offers guidance to lay leaders, clergy, and regional leaders as they deal with the grief and discernment process of struggling churches. Designed for group study, each chapter includes reflection questions for discussion. A listing of additional resources is also included." />
