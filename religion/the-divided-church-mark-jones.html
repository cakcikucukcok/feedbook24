  <title>The Divided Church - Mark Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Will both Pentecostal and non-Pentecostal Christians be willing to let certain beliefs be shaken concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit?
 Will they consider any clearly scriptural teaching that threatens certain long-standing denominational viewpoints?
 Will they dare to be challenged to open their hearts and teaching to the scriptures?
Pentecostal and non-Pentecostal Christians have been reaching out to build the Body of Christ since the first century. Today, however, the differing viewpoints concerning the power of the Holy Spirit have left Christians few options but to choose between one of two sides as they find their place in the Body of Christ.
The Bible shows us a different picture! It reveals that current-day Pentecostal and non-Pentecostal Christians both have room to grow in their teachings concerning this great New Testament miracle called the baptism in the Holy Spirit! As Christians from both sides of this exciting subject come to terms with the biblical truth, an exciting and powerful Church will be seen." />
