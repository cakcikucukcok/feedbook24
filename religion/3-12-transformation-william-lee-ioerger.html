  <title>3:12 Transformation - William Lee Ioerger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;3:12 Transformation will usher in hope and identity to the hearts which follow this divinely outlined message. Through twenty-six chapter-3-verse-12 excerpts from the Bible, the reader is walked through four phases which are necessary to overcome addictions, resentments, obstacles, and bondages that restrain us from fulfilling a life of joyful purpose. 3:12 Transformation contains Gods words of grace and power that can transform our thinking and priorities into destiny and direction. The verses emphasize surrender of our burdens to the mercy, forgiveness, and guidance of our Heavenly Father. Believe in that surrender and hope through faith in the words and promises spoken to us through the Bible and Jesus Christ. Then, with a new mentality, we must learn to live in our calling and purpose which only each one of us individually can fulfill as Gods perfect creation and masterpiece. Finally, we are encouraged to proclaim this hope for those around us to see and hear. 3:12 Transformation acts as a catalyst to reveal the truth and faith needed to not only accept our Heavenly Fathers hopes for us, but to guide us into our true identities. 3:12 Transformation was revealed to William Lee Ioerger on November 29th, 2010 at 3:12 a.m. Since that glorious revelation, 3:12 Transformation has been birthed into a ministry, book, and Holy-Spirit-led tool that has set hearts free from various strongholds as well as challenged believers into acceptance of purposeful ministry and service.&lt;/p&gt;" />
