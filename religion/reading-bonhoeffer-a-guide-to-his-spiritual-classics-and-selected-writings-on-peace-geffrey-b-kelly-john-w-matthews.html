  <title>Reading Bonhoeffer: A Guide to His Spiritual Classics and Selected Writings on Peace - Geffrey B. Kelly, John W. Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dorothee Soelle once wrote, Dietrich Bonhoeffer is the one German theologian who will lead us into the third millennium. As we near the end of the first decade of this third millennium, Bonhoeffer continues to inspire new generations as a spiritual guide for their actions on behalf of peace and social justice. This book by Geffrey Kelly provides a critical analysis and reading guide to two of the spiritual classics that are now available in new translations through Fortress Press. Reading Bonhoeffer offers a running commentary of each segment of these popular texts along with discussion questions suitable for the university and seminary classroom as well as parish adult education programs. In a final section of the book, Kelly excerpts and analyzes three significant texts by Bonhoeffer on the need for world peace against the rising militarism and continued glorification of war in Germany and other European nations." />
