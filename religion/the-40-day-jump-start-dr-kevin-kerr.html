  <title>The 40 Day Jump Start - Dr Kevin Kerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most difficult disciplines to master is&lt;br /&gt;
to become persistent in prayers. I cannot&lt;br /&gt;
possibly count the number of times I have renewed&lt;br /&gt;
my vow to God, which includes making a fresh&lt;br /&gt;
commitment to pray regularly. However, it seemed&lt;br /&gt;
to me that no matter how hard I tried to seek the&lt;br /&gt;
Lord in prayer, the more I gave up after a short&lt;br /&gt;
while.&lt;br /&gt;
I know that I am not alone by far. I read some&lt;br /&gt;
research recently from a popular faith based&lt;br /&gt;
magazine that only 1-in-5 Christians have a regular,&lt;br /&gt;
scheduled daily prayer time.&lt;br /&gt;
After a careful self-evaluation, including a&lt;br /&gt;
detailed research as to why I followed this particular&lt;br /&gt;
pattern, I came to the conclusion that the main&lt;br /&gt;
reason I kept on giving up was, my prayer life had no&lt;br /&gt;
structure at all.&lt;br /&gt;
The bible says that where there is no vision the&lt;br /&gt;
people may perish. My daily prayer schedule needed&lt;br /&gt;
vision and structure. So I decided to ensure that my&lt;br /&gt;
supplications were more thematic and directed to&lt;br /&gt;
deal with specific subjects on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;
After organising my prayers I saw tremendous&lt;br /&gt;
breakthroughs in many areas of my life including my&lt;br /&gt;
finances, my church, my emotions, behavioural and&lt;br /&gt;
of course my attitude towards my enemies.&lt;br /&gt;
I have outlined a few of my daily devotional&lt;br /&gt;
readings for you to muse over and pick you up a&lt;br /&gt;
little bit. I sincerely hope and trust that they will be&lt;br /&gt;
helpful and as you endeavour to &amp;lsquo;jump start&amp;rsquo; your&lt;br /&gt;
prayer life!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start reading this material, please&lt;br /&gt;
begin your 40 days of seeking God by asking the&lt;br /&gt;
merciful Father to forgive your all those sins that&lt;br /&gt;
hinder your experience with Him and cause you to&lt;br /&gt;
have inner feelings of guilt and condemnation.&lt;br /&gt;
When we ask for forgiveness, we are reassured in&lt;br /&gt;
the scriptures that no matter how terrible we&lt;br /&gt;
regard our actions to be, the blood of Christ has the&lt;br /&gt;
efficacy to continually cleanse us daily from all&lt;br /&gt;
unrighteousness! (1 John 1:9)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;the Lord of hosts.&amp;rsquo; (Mal. 3:7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Kevin Kerr is Senior Pastor &amp;amp; founder of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
