  <title>Where Are My Blessings? - Doreen Lynn Leavitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What Did I Do to Deserve This?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering this one day in prayer and was even bold enough to ask. Lord, Im a good person, reallywhat did I do to deserve this? I even listed my good qualities to my Father because He seemed to need to be reminded. I only asked because I felt like I needed a reassuring word of how much God loves me or, how special I am to Him, or that these rough times would be coming to an end shortly. So, God in His wisdom and understanding of my self-pity and lack of inner-confidence at this moment took me to Hebrews 12:5 And have you quite forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you, His child? Look here, God was ready to encourage me, His child. How awesome is He? He said, My son (daughter), dont be angry when the Lord punishes you. Dont be discouraged when He has to show you where you are wrong. What? I dont get it. Exactly, I didnt get it. That was why I had to pray, Lord: dont let me miss it. He was going to make sure that I didnt miss it so that I could receive the full blessings of being a child of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Where Are My Blessings is written in a direct and challenging style to inspire those seeking a deeper and more intimate relationship with Jesus. The author writes in a conversational style encouraging the Believer not to miss it! Whether or not you are going through tough times, or you are currently in a better place, Where Are My Blessings clearly teaches how to live a life that is not all about you, but all about Him!&lt;/p&gt;
