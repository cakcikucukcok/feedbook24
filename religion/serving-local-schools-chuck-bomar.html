  <title>Serving Local Schools - Chuck Bomar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The heartbeat of every local community is found in its local schools. Yet many Christians have little to no connection with school leaders, and few churches have an active ministry presence. If you want to effectively reach your community, you must take the time to invest in school administrators, teachers, and families. Not having a relationship just isn&amp;rsquo;t an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many schools today are facing budget crises&amp;rsquo; and financial shortfalls or declining enrollment. School leaders and teachers are more open than ever before to partnering with parents, neighbors, and churches in a sustainable way. This book shares stories and examples of how schools and churches can work together for the common good of students and the community. You&amp;rsquo;ll gain a better understanding of the laws defining the line of separation between church and state, and you will learn how to best approach school leaders with creative ideas for working together.&amp;nbsp;Serving Local Schools&amp;nbsp;provides biblical support and practical resources to equip individuals and churches to meet the needs of local schools while faithfully witnessing to the good news found in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
