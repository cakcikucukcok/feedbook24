  <title>The World Is Not Six Thousand Years Old-So What? - Antoine Bret, Ian Hutchinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do so many think the Bible teaches that the universe is six thousand years old? There are many good biblical and historical reasons to read Genesis 1 nonliterally, and there are many good scientific reasons to think the universe is much older. Out of this misconception, some will lose faith, while others won&#39;t find it. This book was written for a large audience, gathering in a little more than one hundred pages the main biblical, historical, and astrophysical reasons to recognize that the universe is far more than six thousand years old. Contrary to some common views, scientists do not simply assume physical laws have been the same in the past. They observe it." />
