  <title>Dee-Mentions of This Journey - Pastor Diann Love White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To my Big Brother, Christ Jesus (Immanuel), who is my light and my salvation. I thank You. You have walked every step of this journey with me. I especially want to let You know that as I look back over the rugged road, I now realize that those were Your footprints and not mine. So I want to thank You for carrying me and all my burdens. My iniquities were heavy, and my clothes were so dirty. But You held me close anyhow, and You cleansed me with Your powerful blood. You set my feet on solid ground, and You have been my place of peace, through the storms of this life. You have kept me from getting dirty again, and You have surrounded me with songs of victory. I thank You for saving me, setting me free, raising me up and giving me all that I need in You. Your little sister, Dee.&lt;/p&gt;" />
