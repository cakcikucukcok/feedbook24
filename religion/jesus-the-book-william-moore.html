  <title>Jesus, the Book - William Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Examples of subjects in this book include the significance of name in Scriptures; for example, what does it mean to have a new name which no one knows except the person receiving it?  We will superficially examine the importance of numbers by examining the number forty.  We will discuss the importance of spiritual principles; for example, The Elder Shall Serve The Younger.  The Bible is emphatic that the bones of Jesus could not be broken.  Nothing is meaningless in Scripture, and this was a condition to every Levitical sacrifice.  We will also discuss why Moses, as great a prophet as he was, could not lead Israel into the Promised Land.  It goes beyond his error at the waters of Meribah.  Why is baptism important?  Is the mode of baptism important?  What are redemptive and non-redemptive temples, and what are their differences?  An initial interpretation of the gates of New Jerusalem, if not perfect, is a starting point for further study.  Finally, I would be negligent if I failed to inform you at the outset of the Charismatic leaning  throughout the book.
May God bless you from the first page to the last!
