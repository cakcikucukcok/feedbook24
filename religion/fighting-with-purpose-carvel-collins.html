  <title>Fighting with Purpose - Carvel Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I therefore so run, not as uncertainly: so fight I, not as one that beateth the air (1 Corinthians 9:26).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every believer is faced with some type of trial to test their faith. My prayer is that after reading this book, you will be empowered with the power of God to combat all your enemies. This book was written for anyone facing trying times, who feels like they are not making progress and wants to throw in the towel. You may even feel like any hope of recovery is impossible. I want to encourage you today to get a second wind and get back in the fight. This book will teach you how to stand firm on the Word of God when the enemy is throwing his punches. You may be down today, but your victory is on the way. If God be for you, who can be against you? David faced a giant, Daniel slept with lions, the three Hebrew boys were thrown into the fire, and Jesus hung on the cross, but they all had something in common: they didnt give up; they fought with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
