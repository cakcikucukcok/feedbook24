&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;Christians sending the wrong message to the world is a warning to all who profess to being Christians. Their actions speak volumes about their relationship with God. Satan and the world that he controls has made many Christians a part of his battle plan against God. What you say and more importantly what you do, demonstrates to the world the identity of your true master. As Christians, we are supposed to represent God and our Lord Jesus Christ to the world. Living in peace with the world has caused many of us to become collaborators with the world in unholy activities. In the book of Romans chapter 12 verse18, the bible gives some general guidance on how we are to conduct ourselves. It states,  If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. The problem with this guidance is that people have gone way beyond religious tolerance and accepting ungodly behavior. Christians have forgotten the most important part to understanding what this scripture really means. The scripture Hebrews 12:14 sheds light on the application of the scripture in Romans 12:18.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;It states, &lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black&quot;&gt;Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:  Certainly we must try to live in peace with the world but at what cost? Christians cannot forsake living holy to have peace with the world. When we do, the world is watching and judging us as one of them. The question then becomes, whom do you serve? Do you serve God only in words and serve his enemy in actions and deeds? This is your Christian testimony to the world. It shows the world that you care more about living in peace with it than you do about living holy and obeying God. This book addresses the practice and acceptance of willful sin.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
