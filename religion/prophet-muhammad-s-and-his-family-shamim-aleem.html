  <title>Prophet Muhammad (S) and His Family - Shamim Aleem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Though over the past 1400 years, thousand of books have been written on the different aspects of the life of the Prophet Muhammad (S). Even then it cannot claim to be true and exhaustive picture of his multidimensional life as has been successfully projected in this book.The author has tried to look at his family life from a sociological perspective, an approach different from that of other writers. Her attempt is to place at the disposal of young English speaking people, a wider view of the family life of the Prophet,so that they may learn something from it to make their own lives more fruitful and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years and especially after 9/11,interest in Islam and Islamic literature has increased tremendously. Non believers are in a dilemma. On one hand Islam is suppose to be a religion of peace,while on the other,terrorism association with Muslims is on the rise. By making an attempt to depict an objective picture of the life of Prophet Muhammad(S), the author has tried to underline the fact that Islam is not a religion of violence but of peace and the life of the Prophet provides convincing evidence of the same and whatever is being done under the name of Muslim by a handful people has hardly any relation with Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book may be a source of interest to those non Muslims who are keen to know more about Islam.&lt;/p&gt;" />
