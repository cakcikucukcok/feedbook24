  <title>Mindblowing - J.P. Codnia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of Darwinian evolution in the nineteenth century, few topics have been considered as intriguing or as explosive. Darwins theory and creationism struggle for a place within us, the place where our beliefs are held. Because of this, the theories have become a tug of war dividing people at every level and, occasionally, leading them all the way to court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to help settle the ages-long battle between Darwinian evolution and intelligent design, Jacob Kodnia spent years studying both theories. Having put each to the test in a singular way, he makes his findings public during a lecture in Moscow but, before he can make his conclusion, he gets taken away under suspicion of inciting the audience to public disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting a friend in Moscow, best friends Liz McGillan and Wanda Newtowne attend the lecture and witness the disturbing incident. After learning that the case goes to court, Liz and Wanda decide to dig deeper into Kodnias views, forming a coalition supported by their Russian friend Irina to help Kodnia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflict between faith and science takes center stage once again, and everyone has an opinion. But the ensuing investigation causes the legal system to objectively examine evolution and creation, leading to unexpected results. &lt;/p&gt;" />
