  <title>Prayers in the Psalm - Pat Glasper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our most powerful weapon is prayer.
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
Put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
One of the things, we must understand is,  what is the whole armour of God. The whole armour of God is the Word of God and His Word is transitioned back to Him through prayer. When placed in the hands of a believer Prayer will become the ultimate defense against disobedience, sin and the works of Satan. We find that the principalities, ungodly powers, the works of the rulers of darkness, and the works of spiritual wickedness in high places , tends to encapsulate the people who neglect to pray. 
The works of the enemy is to kill steal and destroy. But the Word of God is to bring forth life and deliverance. We all know that the enemy entices the heart of man and provokes him to sin. This usually happens because man fails to utilize the privileges that God has given him to come into the divine connection of prayer. It is time to pray so that the things that exist within our lives that is not of God can be turned around. We have got to pray before anything can be truly fulfilled in our life. Remember it is only whats of God that is going to last. 
It is said that we are drifting into a recession and the burst of an economical crisis is trying to consume the land. But when man decide to release his hands and truly pray and allow the hands of God flourish the land we will see the dynamics turn in the favor of God.
If my people which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. (2Chronicles 7:14 KJV)" />
