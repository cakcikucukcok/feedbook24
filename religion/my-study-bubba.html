  <title>My Study - Bubba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bible teaches us to seek God diligently. The Bible also teaches that we reap what we sow; in other words, what we work for with effort, we will justly receive. Time is of great essence. It takes time to truly understand the mysteries of life. As a mature adult, time well spent is our reward in life. We once were blind, but now we see. When we are very young, we do not see the reality of life. It takes time. The author, Charles Traina, has spent years and countless hours studying the scriptures. You may read what he has found in just a few hours, but understanding still takes time. Will you take the time before your time runs out? Once you close your eyes in your eternal slumber, your time is of no use. Read My Study; it then will become your study. It may encourage you to study scripture, and your own time will be well spent. 
Praise be to God." />
