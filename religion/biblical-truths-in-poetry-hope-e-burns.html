  <title>Biblical Truths in Poetry - Hope E. Burns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These poems deal mostly with Biblical issues. Some address our human condition based on the Scriptures. Others deal with unseen influences that many of us are unaware of, but which impact our lives for better or worse. They were written as a result of 21 years of studying the Bible. &lt;p&gt;
Originally my journey into the Scriptures began as I sought solutions to my own problems. However over the years it has became a quest for answers to lifes deeper issues. When I began reading the Bible I did not believe I would find solutions to my problems. I started reading it out of desperation after I had exhausted books on philosophy and the occult and just about anything else I got my hands on. I read many books promising the secret but they disappointed me. It is really astonishing that a book which just about everyone has sitting around really has the answer to every human need.&lt;p&gt;
I wrote these poems because I came to the realization that many people like me years ago, do not believe in the spiritual. And yet I believe it is evident that if we disregard Biblical teachings about the spiritual realms, life simply does not make a lot of sense. However it is also my experience that many people who claim to be spiritual do not understand what the Bible teaches about the spiritual realm that operates in the earth. &lt;p&gt;
These poems were also written for people who have difficulty reading and understanding the Scriptures. I try to clarify misunderstanding about many important Biblical issues such as Hell and pre-destination. &lt;p&gt;
They are written in simple poetic language for the benefit of anyone who is interested in Biblical Truth." />
