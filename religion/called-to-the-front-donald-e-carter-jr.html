  <title>Called to the Front - Donald E. Carter Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My life took a sudden, unexpected change on June 10, 2002. For this event to occur at that time, on that day, at that moment in my life just didnt seem like the right thing to be happening. But it is from that experience I was able to glean the title of this book, Called To The Front.  
You too have been Called To The Front. Whatever is opposing you right now probably seems to be great and overwhelming. You may be wondering if you can prevail against this challenge.  My words to you today are, Be encouraged.
I invite you to walk with me through the word of God as he speaks in Ephesians 6:10-18. You will discover that where you are right now is not by accident. The front you are on is of Gods choosing. He has called you, prepared you, and placed His confidence in you. God has equipped you with armor: a belt of truth, a breastplate of righteousness, shoes in preparation to proclaim the Gospel, a shield of faith, a helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, his word. Along with these armaments comes the battle plan for combat through prayer. Greater still, God has already clinched your victory." />
