  <title>Embracing the Call - Rev. Betty  A Beach-Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Embracing the Call is the true story of what can happen when an imperfect woman discovers a perfectly gracious God. Rev. Betty Beach-Connell is a retired pastoral minister in the United Methodist Church. Born and raised in New York State. Betty served churches in the New York Annual Conference for 28 years. But that&amp;#39;s just part of the story... From her idyllic early life in rural New York, to her troubled teens and the young love that nearly destroyed her, Betty&amp;#39;s journey to the Lord is one any woman can relate to. It is the unvarnished truth confessed by a dear friend, a tale of human limitations and God&amp;#39;s limitless grace. Embracing the Call is the story of a life split in two by a day of reckoning that changed one woman&amp;#39;s path in life and created a legacy that has touched three generations. And it is the tale of a shining example of what can happen when you stop guessing, say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to God and discover your own divine Call. From farm girl in a frilly dress to an abused young woman lost in love to a single mother struggling to survive, Betty&amp;#39;s life before ministry is every bit as compelling as her pioneering struggle as a woman called by God to embrace a role church tradition, doctrine, family and friends would have denied her. But she persevered; she listened to God&amp;#39;s voice and found in her calling a life of joy and fulfillment unlike any she could have ever expected. Read &amp;quot;Embracing the Call&amp;quot; and let Betty&amp;#39;s story encourage and inspire you to let go of your past, grab on to God and embrace His Call on your own life. &amp;quot;Young or old, there are no limits, because God has no limits. Let me encourage you to take that first step, and watch Him amaze you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Rev. Betty A. Beach-Connell&lt;/p&gt;" />
