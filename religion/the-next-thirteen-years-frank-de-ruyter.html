  <title>The Next Thirteen Years - Frank de Ruyter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next Thirteen Years&lt;/em&gt; started with the question of how the Mayan Calendar date of 21 December 2012 might be connected to Christian apocalyptic expectations for the end of this age. A certain amount of paranoia was no doubt produced by the unexpected destruction of much of my hometown (Christchurch) through a number of earthquakes that struck throughout 2011, during the year of the super-Moon. The 2011 Japan tsunami came soon after, and these disasters seemed to be leading into 2012, when NASA was also anticipating dangerous solar flares. Many thought the government knew something that the rest of us did not, and wild speculation broke out on YouTube from 2011 onwards, fed by the massive underground bunker-building programs and the arming of FEMA camps all across the United States. Huge stock-piling of food in these bunkers throughout 2013 is not helping to calm public nerves. Financial prognosticators have also foreseen an imminent collapse, and the picture being drawn is almost apocalyptic, expressing a readiness for cosmic disaster or war on American soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own beliefs anticipate critical events from 2026 to 2030, which is when I think the final great Antichrist will be upon us, who will appear with the overthrow of Jerusalem. The thirteen-year gap from 2013 to 2026 is of the right length to suggest the next thirteen years could be the period of apostasia (rebellion) that Paul speaks of as preceding this great Man of Sin, whom Christ must destroy at his return. What governments are doing now can easily be read as preparation for the collapse of society, perhaps with the aim of building a New World Order from the ashes, ruling over whoever is fortunate enough to survive what is about to come. Plans to cull population may also be brought to fruition in this great set of events about to take place upon the Earth. In setting the plan of the elitists alongside what I think will transpire from 2026 onwards, I lay before the reader what I think the Next Thirteen Years may hold for us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
