  <title>31-Day Structured Engagement with God - Martha A. Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A life-transforming approach to tearing down relationship barriers, Structured Engagement  is a dialogical (communication) act between participants (in this case, God and the reader) that evolves around knowledge of and relationship with one another to create a pathway to truth-telling, freedom to act, and mutuality of purpose. 
Although words matter in the Structured Engagement process, this journal speaks to the reader with photos more than with words! This 31-Day Structured Engagement with God, unlike most devotional journals, is a collection of photos (from the deep south that the photographer calls the tools of life and leadership) that have been paired with Scripture to glorify God, and inform the spirituality, character, and leadership skills of the reader.
This 31-day meditational/devotional journal is an excellent tool for building relationship and leadership skills of small groups, Sunday School classes or youth groups. It is a unique, spiritual journey that encourages thinking outside the box about Scripture and spirituality from a relationship-centered focus versus a self-centered focus." />
