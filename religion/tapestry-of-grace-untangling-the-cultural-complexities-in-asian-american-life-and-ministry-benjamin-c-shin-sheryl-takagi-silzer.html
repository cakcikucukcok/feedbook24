  <title>Tapestry of Grace: Untangling the Cultural Complexities in Asian American Life and Ministry - Benjamin C. Shin, Sheryl Takagi Silzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Why do the first generation still act like that?&quot; &quot;Why can&#39;t we try some new ideas?&quot; &quot;Why are the second generation so lazy?&quot; &quot;Why are the second generation so disrespectful?&quot; &quot;Isn&#39;t it a shame how the church is split between the two generations?&quot; These and many more questions reflect the tangled conflicts within the Asian American church. Cultural differences have led to many misunderstandings and conflicts. Conflicts have created bitterness and churches have split apart. How can these tangled threads be rewoven into a beautiful tapestry of God&#39;s grace? What would it take for the Asian American church to reflect God&#39;s grace?  In Tapestry of Grace, Dr. Benjamin C. Shin and Dr. Sheryl Takagi Silzer apply their years of study and teaching to explain how the cultural complexities that occur between the different generations of the Asian American church can be untangled. Taking lessons from their own spiritual journeys, they show how each generation can experience the amazing grace of the Gospel." />
