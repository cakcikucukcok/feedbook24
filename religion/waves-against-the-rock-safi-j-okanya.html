  <title>Waves Against the Rock - Safi J. Okanya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to let you know how against all odds, you too can build a life with dignity and real meaning. You too can move beyond negativity to resilience and strength.
Safi Okanya is an exceptional woman who has overcome extreme adversity and hardship to become the strong, resilient leader she is today. 
In this Safis first book, she reveals a selection of experiences she endured and survived growing up in the Congo, living through the war, starting the first of many businesses at the age of 12, living in four countries and taking on the role of mother and father for her five siblings. Safis dream was to gain an education, become an entrepreneur and under major adversities she achieved her goals.
In this raw and honest account of a very challenging life, Safi shares with you the things that helped her to cope on the days when she felt the most stressed and/or depressed and had lost all her self-esteem. Yet she knew her family and siblings were dependant on her leading the way and she found a way to not give up on life.
Today able to speak five languages, single mother of two children, Safi shares her insights and life lessons learned with her coaching clients and audiences as she gives them tools and tactics to become as strong as a rock and able to overcome the pounding waves and fierce storms of life today. 
Whether you are currently facing challenges in your work life, relationships, families or health, you must read this book. If Safi could overcome the huge adversities she was made to endure, you too can be inspired to choose to move beyond your current situation." />
