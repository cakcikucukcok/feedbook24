  <title>The Christmas Eve Conversation - Carol Ann Hope, Stephen Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author developed The Christmas Eve Conversation in 1980 after a conversation with her husband William. He was building a Christmas display in front of his veterinary hospital to raise money for Childrens Hospital. William expressed that, while raising money proved valuable, he was uncomfortable building a display primarily focused on Santa, leaving Jesus secondary.  In response to his concerns, the author wrote and displayed The Christmas Eve Conversation to ensure that patrons, her children and others continued to keep Jesus as an integral part of Christmas. The story involves a conversation between Jesus and Santa Claus in which Santa apologizes to Jesus for the change in focus from Jesuss birthday to Santa bringing presents. Jesuss response reflects the unconditional love he feels for those he died for.
Upon writing the story, the author realized the value of her words and sent it to a newspaper that published it. The authors wisdom concerning the commercialization and devaluation of the true meaning of Christmas was well received and inspirational to her readers. The intent of the author while writing The Christmas Eve Conversation consisted of her desire to preserve faith during the holidays and provide others with a perspective concerning the religious and celebratory discrepancies that occur during Christmas.
The Victorian house illustrated throughout the book is a depiction of the authors home. Her children have jestingly dubbed the house the purple monster. They also affectionately call the author The Queen of the Purple Monster." />
