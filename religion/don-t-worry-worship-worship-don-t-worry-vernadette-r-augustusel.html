  <title>Don’T Worry, Worship Worship, Don’T Worry - Vernadette R. Augustusel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Word of God, I believe we are encouraged to worship God in various ways. Perhaps by continuously meditating on Gods word, singing, or confessing it over oneself, reading it, or just keeping it before your eyes as much as possible is true worship. It is my belief that keeping Gods word before your eyes and rolling it over and over in your mind and heart will help develop you to becoming a strong, mature, spiritual being that will exemplify a lifestyle of worship. Because as he is, so are we in the world (1 John 4:17). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, saturating oneself with Gods word will develop and empower true worshippers. Our Heavenly Father is seeking those who will worship him in spirit and in truth; the truth of his word and the leading of his Holy Spirit dwelling in our hearts. In operating in these simple principles, we purposely plant the Word of God in our heart; and purposefully planting Gods word in our heart will create a lifestyle of worship. A lifestyle of worship is what the Father seeks after, not just lip service of worship, but sincere worship desiring to develop and grow spiritually. People honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me (Matthew 15:8). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worshiping God invokes his presences in the midst of our lives, in our circumstances, and situation. For where the presence of the Lord is, there is peace, guidance, joy, understanding, love, prosperity, and victory. However, worrying, on the other hand, is really a perverted worship that does not glorify God in any way. Just as worshipping invokes Gods presences in our lives, I believe worrying ushers in the presences of Satan, evil, dysfunction, destruction, and confusion into our circumstances, situation, and in the midst of our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worshipping our Heavenly Father empowers us to be a blessing and to do good and great things. Worrying however, is designed to stop, hinder and destroy us from being a blessing, doing good and great things on earth. It is important for us to learn to worship and not worry. Walk in the power and authority that God has given you by learning to worship him instead of worrying. Whose presences are you invoking, inviting, or ushering in the midst of your situation, circumstances, and life? Rememberstay blessed to be a blessing. Now let us live a life of worship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, &lt;/p&gt;
