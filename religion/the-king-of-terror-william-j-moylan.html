  <title>The King of Terror - William J. Moylan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is only aimed at identifying who the two kings of the four lined prophecy, the king of terror, by Nostradamus, really are. 
It takes further the investigation of these two kings than others have done. It looks to the ancient antiquity, the Roman Empire era to the present day combining secular, biblical and ancient historians to form a base as proof for the reader leaving no doubt as to their identity and the uncertain future that is just ahead. This is a book of its time and that time is now as these kings kingdoms, now forming, slowly but surely are manoeuvring into position for the last giant war of wars before the return of Jesus Christ. It is a book, that as events in the world start to unravel around the middle east, will come to be in great demand. It will come into its own. Presently the general public is completely unaware of the future that is coming for them. Led by political world leadership that cannot see the truth because of their own hypocrisy and greed for power. Their human nature will be led into a nuclear holocaust by a cunning dark and deceitful person, the king of terror. 
Identifying just as importantly where their kingdoms are today. Looking at the events and characters during the month of July 1999 filtering out anyone or thing that may be identified as the king of terror. Through using proven sources from secular, biblical history, with ancient reliable historians such as Titus Josephus, the book sets out methodically to prove the two blocks of nations that make up these kings kingdoms today. The European Super State that is now forming and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) group of nations. The prior kingdom is the king of terrors kingdom and the latter SCO being the kingdom of the Mongols he brings back to life. Obviously the kingdom of the Mongols is long gone, as Mongolia is but a tiny nation, but the descendents of this middle age Mongol empire all exist together in the SCO grouping of nations. The European Union Super State that is forming is led by a nation whos history of warfare goes back from two world wars to the sacking of the Jerusalem temple in 70 A.D. and further back to the times of Abraham. This is Germany. This can be proven through secular historians and of course biblical too. Which combine in the book. Also in this prophecy is the last line, that war would reign before and after July 1999. Which is an important part of the prophecy. These reasons are given in the book as a spiritual war that has existed between God and satanic forces for possibly millions of years. These evil forces objected to Gods plan for mankind and have since the rebellion of Lucifer been at war with God. This war is now in its final stage in our age though now a physical one too. It is Satans physical opposite of Jesus Christ that will rule the coming European Super State. The reason for this objection against Gods plan for man by Lucifer is outlined in the book. How the world has been led by a great Religious deception ever since. Lucifers plan to make man destroy itself through nuclear war. This war is at a pivotal stage with the war in Syria today. Which will bring about an alliance of nations that has never before existed. That of Sunni Muslim nations and the European Super State together against Shia Iran and its Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) allies. This Sunni and European alliance will win this war against Iran and then through nuclear holocaust destroy the United States, United Kingdom and Israel.
This will bring a greater war with the SCO nations. The SCO will sweep through Europe then into the middle east, where the European antichrist will have set up his base. The two groups then try to confront Jesus Christ at his second coming and lose. Throughout the book it goes out of its way to give back up analysis to the events just explained. To some who read this book, it will not be to their spiritual or religious beliefs. To others will be a great deed for" />
