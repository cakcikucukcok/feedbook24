  <title>The Holy Ghost - Derick Mack Virgil PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For where you find the Blood of the Cross, you will find the anointing of the Holy Spirit
~ Benny Hinn
When Derick Virgil, at eight years old, asked his mother How are we washed in the Blood of Jesus when He died 2000 years ago and there is none here to wash us? Based on James 1:5, she told him the best thing she could have ever told him, 
Ask God Derick, Ask God.
 So he did. Now, after over 30 years of study, this book has emerged and could be considered one of the deepest Bible Studies ever written on The Holy Third Person of the Trinity &amp; Jesus Holy Blood. 
Based on Theoretical Physics, Logic and Hebrew and Greek word etymologies (history and meanings) in scriptures such as:
Leviticus 17:11 the Life of the Flesh is in the Blood and
Hebrews 9:14 How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
and many more the author reveals how the Blood of Jesus, through the Holy Ghost, washes us from sin. Also revealed are connections between Jesus turning water into wine, God allowing Moses to turn the waters of Egypt into blood, Noahs ark, the Rapture and other major Biblical occurrences. The author invites readers to join him in a sort of dimensional Crime Scene Investigation at the foot of the Cross to determine the true nature of Jesus Blood and the mysterious way It ties together all of these epic Biblical events.
 Hopefully, while you may already &quot;know&quot; the Holy Ghost personally, this book will help you appreciate Him more, depend on Him more, and honor the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit in a different way. 
If you would just like to know the Third Person of The Divine Trinity better or understand Christianity better, this book is for you as well.
The book is available ONLINE in Paperback ($19.99 @ AuthorHouse), Kindle ($7.99), Nook ($8.39) &amp; Hardcover ($25.99 @ AuthorHouse).
