  <title>The Standard Christian Epidemic - David Vilkhovoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why does Christianity fail?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many people mock Christianity as a hypocritical lifestyle, and even Christians themselves have given over to what society says about them. However, Christianity does not work when it is lived by mere human ways, because it is a lifestyle of aggressive faith. This book highlights the truths of the Christian faith, helping you understand why Christianity fails and how to make it work. Its not a formula, but simply a message: Christians shouldnt look to anyone but Jesus Christ as their ultimate example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions answered in this book:&lt;/p&gt;
If God is so real, why dont I experience Him? 
If God is perfect, why is Christianity so controversial? 
Is it possible to live a powerful, influential life as a Christian?
&lt;p&gt;The Standard Christian Epidemic explores in depth the theme of calling the church back to the standard of Jesus Christ instead of that of religion and reliance on self, which has hindered the church for so long.&lt;br /&gt;
-Graham Jones, Reverend, International Gospel Outreach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that David has heard from God. The standard is being raised, and this is the call of God: to break free from the Standard Christian Epidemic!&lt;br /&gt; 
-Mark Casto, pastor, Omega Center International&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;David is pointing the way for the next generation, the up-and-coming generation that so desperately needs to know truth and the hope that we have in Jesus Christ.&lt;br /&gt;
-Gail Manizak, CEO, The Power and Presence Ministry&lt;/p&gt;" />
