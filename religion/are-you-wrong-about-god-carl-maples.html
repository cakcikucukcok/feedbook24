  <title>Are You Wrong About God? - Carl Maples</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you sure you are going to heaven when you die? Do you believe that you can go to heaven by being a good person? Do you believe that there are multiple ways to God? Do you think that Satan and hell are real or just symbols of evil? Are you sure that your own beliefs about God are correct?
This book provides the answers to these and many other questions. The question &quot;Are you wrong about God?&quot; is an important one, because your eternal life depends on it. Don&#39;t you think it is worth the time to make sure your beliefs are based on the truth, as defined in God&#39;s Word? Sadly, there are many people today who think they are Christians but are going to miss out on God&#39;s gift of eternal life. Many of these people are sitting in churches on a weekly basis.
This book provides the truth about God in an easy-to-read format with Scripture references available. Truth comes from our Creator. This book will point out common weaknesses that we have that make it difficult for us to accept God&#39;s Word. Don&#39;t be fooled by some of the popular or politically correct theories that are becoming prevalent today. God has specific expectations of us that everyone needs to be aware of. This book provides these along with practical things you can do to build a relationship with God." />
