  <title>Mobilizing a Great Commission Church for Harvest: Voices and Views from the Southern Baptist Professors of Evangelism Fellowship - Thomas P. Johnston, Philip Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mobilizing a Great Commission Church for Harvest addresses practical aspects of evangelism in the local church, with the voices and views of nineteen current Southern Baptist professors of evangelism. They address important topics to local church evangelism, such as Invitations with integrity and Preparing for Spiritual Warfare. Key leaders and professors write in their areas of expertise. For examples, Alvin Reid writes on Mobilizing Students, David Wheeler on Servant Evangelism, Josef Solc on Sports Evangelism, and Darrell Robinson on The Evangelist. In addition, the book begins and ends with two different applications of Matthew&#39;s Great Commission.  Mobilizing a Great Commission Church for Harvest is a gold mine of information for both pastor and deacon, as it is for students considering the importance of evangelism to local church ministry. It is fresh, new, and true--as all of its authors teach at SBC-affiliated schools and are grounded in the Bible as the inerrant Word of God!" />
