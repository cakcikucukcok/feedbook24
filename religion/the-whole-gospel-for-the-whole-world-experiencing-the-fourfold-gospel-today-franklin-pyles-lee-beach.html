  <title>The Whole Gospel for the Whole World: Experiencing the Fourfold Gospel Today - Franklin Pyles, Lee Beach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like most Protestant denominations, the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&amp;MA) was founded upon ideas that shaped its vision and ethos throughout its history. Also like most denominations, over time the influence of these ideas on the movement tends to diminish. Denominations, like any organization, have to consistently revisit their original vision in order to remain vitally sustained by those things that gave it a reason for existing in the first place. This book addresses six key ideas that have shaped the Christian and Missionary Alliance throughout its history: Jesus as our savior, sanctifier, healer, and coming king, which are known as the &quot;fourfold gospel,&quot; as well as the concepts of &quot;Jesus only&quot; and world mission. These ideas are at the heart of the C&amp;MA identity. However, there has long been a sense within C&amp;MA circles that these core ideas are not always given the kind of attention that they deserve so that they can dynamically shape the movement as it faces the challenges of being the church in the twenty-first century. This volume is a resource for Alliance churches that will help them re-engage with the central tenets of Alliance theology and spirituality in a way that will ultimately inspire greater passion for the cause of Christ in the world as it is uniquely expressed through the movement known as the Christian and Missionary Alliance." />
