  <title>Cleansing of the Soul - Rostan Vital</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The cleansing of the soul contains truths that must be disclosed. As one of the guarding soldiers for this century, I have to assume my responsibility and take charge of my mission. In the same way that God Almighty had assigned a similar task to Ezekiel as mentioned in the book of Ezekiel chapter 3 verses 17 and 18, I am charge with the mission to bring to the inhabitants of the earth divine messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17&quot;Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman to the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me. 18&quot;When I say to the wicked, &#39;You will surely die,&#39; and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soul, the well-being of mankind rights, as well as our bodies, in the instance we make the invocation to bless the holy name our spirit grows. It is up to us to ensure the continuous growth this wise entity, which is our soul.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I have listed the necessary points that will empower you the readers in the physical world and beyond.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[a] = Forgiveness, allows you to free yourself as well that others&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[b] = Karma, reap all good works or pay your debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; [c] = Death, what it is to die before you die. 
[d] = Self-healing, each of us possess this ability, but it is quite important to know how to use this power within you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in this chapter, you will find a self healing ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; [e] = the power of speech, a powerful tool that should be used to grow and prosper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[f] = Suffering, carries within itself the seed of triumph in this chapter you will find many examples ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[g] = The soul, all of the definitions that will help you to understand the value of this wise entity. In this chapter you will also fine the three principles of hindsight and ideas on how to discover your past life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; [h] = The journey of the soul into the Astral world with the two categories is to say {{top and bottom and how to avoid the area of darkness... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[i] = A ritual to purify and amplify the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pTo expand on the purification mantra I have included a protection mantra.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Beloved brothers and sisters knowledge is accessible to all, but one must remain one step ahead in order to acquire it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverb 8 verse 33:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{ Listen to my instruction and be wise;    do not disregard it}}&lt;/p&gt;
