  <title>Delivered from Destruction - Trina Montreuil Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For this reason, He sent his word; and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction. Psalm107: 20 A person can never determine if something or someone is destructive unless there is something to compare it to. Destruction means to injure, harm, or wound. I did not understand how rapidly I was destroying my life and became a threat to my very own soul. Virtually living on the edge as if there was nothing in my future to look forward to. Without the proper guidance and affirmative action, I had become reckless and slowly but surely degrading the core of positive values that existed in my upbringing. Not noticing that the trials of life can at times change a rational person to one that is capable of destroying everything and everyone in their reach. Destructive behaviors can be derived from negative experiences and oftentimes prey on the fears of life causing a sense of insecurity. This insecurity caused me to seek attention in all the wrong places and in all the wrong people. When we lack guidance and self-control our flesh has the potential to creatively destroy that, which is dear to us such as our family, friends and relationships and most importantly, jeopardizing our spiritual walk." />
