  <title>Poetry to God, Volume 1 - Terry Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With over two hundred poems diving into the spiritual journey of Everyman, this collection forms the poets impassioned plea for the masses to awaken from the slumber of earthly activities and seek God. He understands, better than most, that no individual is a model of perfection; however, his emphasis with his poetry compilation is on growth and ultimately embracing the love of the Lord into ones heart. From his darkest days, he discovered the mercy of God and believes that anyone else can too. This conviction is strongly prevalent in each poem he composes. The Dream is Webbs version of the warning signal to man that he is headed down the wrong path.
-The U.S. Review of Books
You never cry alone, my child, 
For when you cry, I do  
Although this life may bring you pain, 
My child, just trust in me, 
And if you will obey my word, 
Ill give you victory!
Several poems offer praise to God, while in The Heavens Glory of God celebrates the beauty of Gods divine creation: 
Enveloped in beauty, the silence of night, 
Sprinkled with stars in Heaven bright. 
In cloudless skies, the shimmering, 
The Heavenly stars are rendering. 
The glory of God, crisp and clear, 
His wondrous glory far, but near.
Let Poetry to God move your heart and soul, and draw closer to the Lord!" />
