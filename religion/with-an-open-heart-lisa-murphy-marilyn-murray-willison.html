This is not just the story of a child who died, but rather a tribute to a little boy who really, honestly lived. Yes, its true that, ultimately, we lost our son. But we know how blessed we were to have met him, loved him, and to have been given the gift of time with his sweet soul. We know that God is good, and though our pain and suffering are sure, the reality remains that Daniel is safe in the arms of our Lord. How blessed we are thateven though it was for such a short timeGod entrusted us as Daniels loving family before He called our son Home to Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;" />
