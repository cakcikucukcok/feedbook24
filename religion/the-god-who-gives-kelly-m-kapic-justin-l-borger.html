  <title>The God Who Gives - Kelly M. Kapic, Justin L. Borger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christians wonder what the Christian life is all about. They hear about &amp;ldquo;grace&amp;rdquo; but struggle to rightly understand it, much less live it.&amp;nbsp; They are taught about God, but their vision of him does not always reflect the full biblical portrait of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. When this happens Christians struggle to know the ways of God and how to joyfully participate in his work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God Who Gives&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides a compelling vision of Christian faith and life, helping readers discover the uniqueness of the gospel&amp;mdash;that God&#39;s kingdom comes not by taking, but by giving&amp;mdash;God gives Himself!&amp;nbsp; We are invited into the fullness of life that can only come through the gift of God&amp;rsquo;s divine generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking readers through the grand biblical narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and kingdom author Kelly M. Kapic helps us see our story in and through the story of Scripture. He shows that everything belongs to God, and yet because of our turning and taking from him we experience a kind of suffocating bondage to sin. So how does God reclaim us? God gives again. The God who gave in creation restores by recreating us through his Son and by his Spirit. The kingdom of God is an overflowing measure of divine generosity that we are invited to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God Who Gives&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;calls readers to discover that the whole Christian story is founded upon the Triune God&amp;rsquo;s self-giving and our belonging to God. Fully embracing this truth changes how we view God, ourselves, and the world. Living in God&#39;s gifts, we are freed to give ourselves and truly experience life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
