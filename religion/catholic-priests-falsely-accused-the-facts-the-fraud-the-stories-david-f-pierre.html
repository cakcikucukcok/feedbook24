  <title>Catholic Priests Falsely Accused: The Facts, The Fraud, The Stories - David F. Pierre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We must continue to demand justice and compassion for victims of Catholic clergy abuse. This is not optional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time and time again in recent years, Catholics and non-Catholics alike have been horrified by hideous stories of wretched abuse and betrayal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there is a side of the Catholic Church abuse narrative that is not getting the attention it warrants. Countless priests in the United States have been falsely accused of committing horrendous child abuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topics in this book include:&lt;br&gt;... how the most recent figures indicate that one third of accused priests have been accused falsely;&lt;br&gt;... the stunning court declaration with the opinion from a retired FBI investigator that &amp;quot;one half&amp;quot; of all accusations are &amp;quot;entirely false&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;greatly exaggerated&amp;quot;;&lt;br&gt;... the American cardinal who has been the target of two bogus abuse charges;&lt;br&gt;... how accusers have retained huge monetary settlements even though their allegations later proved to be false;&lt;br&gt;... the father of an accuser who appeared at the funeral of an accused priest and apologized for the false allegation that his son leveled;&lt;br&gt;... the Catholic archbishop who tells of being spat upon by a member of SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests);&lt;br&gt;... the monsignor who waited five years to be exonerated of abuse charges even though his alleged victims denied that they were molested;&lt;br&gt;plus much more." />
