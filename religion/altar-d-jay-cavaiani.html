  <title>Altar’d - Jay Cavaiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do you believe what you believe? If someone were to ask you that question, do you have, and could you respond with, a compelling answer?
The Bible says Jesus died on a cross to forgive men of their sins. Why did He have to die, and why does His death forgive us? How can we know if what the Bible says is true?  Altar’d provides   inspiring, historic, faith-building evidence, revealing how God fulfilled His own rules and master plan to restore his people to relationship with Him through the sacrifice of his son, Jesus. Many powerful forms of evidence are displayed that will help fan into flame the faith of all who read.  
Many people believe faith is some type of mystical thing that one simply believes “because they believe.” The truth is that many people we care about need evidence, which can then lead to real, lasting faith. Altar’d provides evidence that reveals God is real, the Bible can be trusted, and that He has a plan for your life.  Jesus offered his all on the cross, and our proper response is to offer our lives as “a living sacrifice” to him. This is what it means to be Altar’d. Have you Altar’d your life?" />
