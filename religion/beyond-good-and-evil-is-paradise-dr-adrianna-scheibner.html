  <title>Beyond Good  and Evil..... Is Paradise - Dr. Adrianna Scheibner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Asleep to the All-Embracing Presence of God, we dream of good and evil..
The answer that would take us out of this drama of pain, suffering and never-ending conflicts is so simple, it defies all human logic! 
For how can a mere conscious awareness of the Presence of Spirit reverse all the laws of the world? Beyond every restriction of time, space, distance and limits of any kind!?
Conscious awareness of the Presence of God as One with All is The Key that allows Gods unlimited Power to manifest in our actual experience: there is no order of difficulty in miraclesGods Laws supersede all laws that pertain to the material reality.
It is simple because no one needs to practice what he already is: we just need to realize it! 
YET, as Nelson Mandela has said:
Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate,
but that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us.
We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, handsome, talented and fabulous?
Actually, who are you not to be?
You are a child of God.
Your playing small does not serve the world.
There is nothing enlightened about shrinking
so that other people won&#39;t feel insecure around you.
We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us.
It is not just in some; it is in everyone.
And, as we let our own light shine,
we consciously give other people permission
to do the same. As we are liberated from our fear,
our presence automatically liberates others." />
