Expecting a child is a momentous time in the life of a new mother, and often our thoughts are focused on one thing and one thing onlyour newborn babies. So its all too easy for new moms to miss another important step in motherhoodplanning for our own time with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating the Newborn Stage: A Practical Guide to the First Four Weeks is an honest and compelling reminder to new moms that they should remember to keep God central to their lives while they care for their newborn children. This unique four-week study guide is specifically designed for new moms, and it offers twenty-eight daily lessons with practical chapters on feeding, schedules, healing, managing emotions, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our love for our babies makes it possible for us to sacrifice our time, sleep, and sanity for our kids, and we must remember to also make time on the journey of motherhood to treasure the relationship we have with the Lord. As you start the journey of motherhood yourself, God will guide you through it as you learn to love, to heal, and to continue to put him first and cherish the miracle in your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
