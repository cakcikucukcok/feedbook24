      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Political and personal crises are woven together with scripture to bring answers to a world in chaos. Shocking at times, controversial for sure, contradictions, discrepancies, inconsistencies, disputes and antitheses do not confuse the bloodwashed! They are the ones who know  just know  that God is not a celestial Santa Claus. They know, believe and are completely convinced that God loved them so much that He gave His only Son so that anyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16 NIV) In this day of anarchy and confusion, fraud and lies, nuances and applied relativity, the words of Jesus should ring loud and clear: Those of you who scorn this playing around with the devil that gets paraded as profundity, be assured Ill not make life any harder for you than it already is. Hold fast till I come! (Revelation 2:24-25 MSG) Write It on My Heart is a penetrating and insightful read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
