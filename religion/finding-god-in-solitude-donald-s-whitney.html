  <title>Finding God in Solitude - Donald S. Whitney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Finding God in Solitude&lt;/I&gt; explores the devotional piety of one of America’s most important religious figures, Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) of Massachusetts. From his childhood to his death shortly after becoming president of Princeton, and especially from his Christian conversion through his Northampton pastorate and the Great Awakening to his missionary work among Indians on the frontier, Edwards’ personal spirituality is evaluated, particularly in terms of its impact upon his pastoral ministry. Specifically, the influence of his private piety on his public labors is considered in terms of his pastoral relationships, his pastoral preaching, and his pastoral publications. Edwards’ piety and his pastoral ministry are also assessed in light of their relative consistency with both the English Puritan and Colonial New England Puritan heritage from which Edwards was descended. This book would be useful in courses on Jonathan Edwards, American religious history, Colonial New England, Puritanism, Christian spirituality, or pastoral ministry." />
