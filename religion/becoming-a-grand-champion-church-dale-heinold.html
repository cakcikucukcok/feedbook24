  <title>Becoming a Grand Champion Church - Dale Heinold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are many ideas about how to increase the size of a church. But what if our vision is upside down? What if Gods desire is that we focus on being a quality church instead of simply a large church? The Bible envisions the church as a spotless bride, a vision of quality. Todays church seems far from Gods vision of perfection, but that does not change the goals God has for His flock. Using Psalm 23 as a blueprint, &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Grand Champion Church&lt;/em&gt; explores how Christ is shepherding His church toward maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gap exists between this ages knowledge of sheep and shepherding that makes it difficult to grasp the fullness of Christs shepherding work in the church. The author seeks to fill that gap with homespun remembrances of raising sheep to be shown at the county fair. He then ties the shepherds duties with practical suggestions of how the whole body can work alongside the Good Shepherd toward Christs vision for His bride. The result of following Gods plan is a Grand Champion Church that reflects the qualities of Christ to the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
