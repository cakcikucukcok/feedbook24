  <title>Cross-Shaped Leadership: On the Rough and Tumble of Parish Practice - John A. Berntsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Lutheran pastor John Berntsen, the cross is about more than the crucifixion on Good Friday. It is shorthand for the whole drama of salvation--God&amp;#39;s decisive act of reconciling the world to God&amp;#39;s own self. The cross is dying and rising with Christ, but at a deeper level it is the story of the world&amp;#39;s resistance to grace. Those who lead are subject to the cross no less than others. In contrast with the current fashion for &amp;quot;visionary&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;purpose-driven&amp;quot; leaders, cross-shaped leaders are not primarily the providers of master plans, nor are they master builders. Cross-shaped leadership is provisional, contextual, and fallible--open-ended ministry that has the character of a pilot project. It is always under construction and revision. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our moment-by-moment functioning in ministry is subject to countless deaths and resurrections, few of which are heroic or glorious. But Berntsen offers good news within this potentially dismal perspective. He writes, &amp;quot;Once we&amp;#39;ve accepted the truth that ministry is hard, even impossible--once we&amp;#39;ve stopped living in denial of this reality, or perhaps whining about it--it becomes the truth that sets us free. We cease being gloomy servants, weighed down by our resentful conviction that we are all alone in our work--the closet atheism born of the worry, &amp;#39;If I don t do it, nobody will&amp;#39;--and instead become joyful coworkers of a strong, wise, and consoling Lord.&amp;quot; With optimism, humor, and deep empathy, Berntsen&amp;#39;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Cross-Shaped Leadership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; offers hope and challenge in the midst of the rough and tumble of parish practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
