  <title>Our Father: Discovering Family - Mitch Carnell, Thomas R. McKibbens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you are young, how do you reconcile so many contradictions in your surroundings? How do you explain being Christian in the face of racial segregation in the church? What do you do with an inquisitive mind in a culture that discourages questioning? These questions clashed for Mitchell Carnell in an unexpected experience in St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral in London. Episodes in his life that had remained separate suddenly came together. Everything changed from that point forward.   This is Carnell&#39;s story as seen through his eyes as he struggled to explore his journey of faith and to determine God&#39;s plan for the rest of his life after experiencing unimaginable loss and heartbreak. Mitchell&#39;s journey begins in a small provincial town in South Carolina and brings him to one of America&#39;s most beautiful cities and to a historic church that encourages an enlightened faith. His story is heavily influenced by family, friends, mentors, hardships, heartaches, great loves, great joy, and overwhelming sorrow. It explores the consequences of experiencing personal discrimination and the satisfaction of not being defeated by such injustice. Carnell&#39;s struggles shed light our own struggles and will help us come through them stronger and with an empowered faith." />
