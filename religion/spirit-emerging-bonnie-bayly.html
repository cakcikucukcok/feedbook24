  <title>Spirit Emerging - Bonnie Bayly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had the urge to do something but did not? This could have been a gentle nudge from your Spirit to take action. Spirit is here to give us guidance and direction, but it has mostly been ignored. We have allowed voices outside ourselves to have a greater influence on us than our inner voice. It is time to bring your inner world back into balance with your outer world. It is time to have equal respect for your intuition and urgings as you do for your intellect and logic. It is time to honor that which is within you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to: &lt;br /&gt; find your inner voice of Spirit &lt;br /&gt; trust the guidance you are given &lt;br /&gt; act on your intuition &lt;br /&gt; overcome the fears that hold you back &lt;br /&gt; bring more of your Spirit into the world &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit is calling. You are being invited to walk with your Spirit every moment of the day. How will you respond to the invitation and answer the call?&lt;/p&gt;" />
