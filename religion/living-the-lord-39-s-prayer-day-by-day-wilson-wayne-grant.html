  <title>Living the Lord&#39;s Prayer Day by Day - Wilson Wayne Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Bible speaks to this deep longing when it affirms that indeed God created man and woman in His image! And at the heart of that image is a God-shaped vacuum waiting to be filled by the presence of the Creator. Built into our very heartbeat is a yearning to know, to have contact with, the One who made us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;breath of God&quot; infused into humankind at the creation (and into each of us at our personal creation) expands to form this vacuum that only God can fill. This vacuum is revealed to each of us through the basic needs which tug at our hearts. The longing for fulfillment of these needs drives our hunger for something more than simple satisfaction of our animal instincts. We are empty, as Saint Augustine articulated, until the vacuum is filled with the presence of God himself. The pull of these needs tugs us toward our Creator. We are &quot;restless&quot; until these needs finds true fulfillment in a relationship with God. This vacuum tugs us toward God, striving as a vacuum always does, to be filled.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hobbled by darkness, so much of it of our own making, we can only grope for the light. But I can only believe that our yearnings after the light must be a pleasure for God to watch. I can see him saying as we grope, &quot;Come on, move toward that crack of light there. Reach for it. Put out your hand. I am waiting to pull you to me?your Creator, your God, your Father.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
