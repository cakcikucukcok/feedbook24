  <title>That His Spirit May Be Saved: Church Discipline as a Means to Repentance and Perseverance - Jeremy M. Kimble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an age of tolerance and moral laxity, the implementation of church discipline is often looked upon with disdain, fear, or incredulousness. However, there is clear biblical precedent for the practice of discipline within a local church context. While many are aware of several passages in Scripture that speak to this reality, in this work, Jeremy Kimble calls readers to observe clear biblical mandates, historic precedent, as well as theological and practical implications for the practice of church discipline.   Seeking to venture past the pragmatic discussions surrounding church discipline, Kimble articulates for his readers a lucid theological presentation of this topic. He argues that discipline serves as a warning of potential end-time judgment. As such, discipline also serves as a means to the sinner&#39;s repentance and the perseverance of the saints within that local church. This theological understanding of discipline calls pastors and congregations to faithfulness. There is a seriousness to church discipline that cannot be ignored, and likewise discipline must also be viewed as a mercy, knowing it is a means to repentance and enduring in one&#39;s faith." />
