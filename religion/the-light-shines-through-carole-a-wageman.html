  <title>The Light Shines Through - Carole A. Wageman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• For Bible study groups, preaching, retreats
• For new and not-so-new Christians seeking to connect Scripture with their personal lives today
The treasure trove of stories from Scripture provides wonderful examples of people encountering the mystery of God. We read these stories over and over, and know how they turn out year after year. The one perspective we might miss, however, is that the characters in Scripture never knew how their story would turn out when they were living the unknown, fear, joy, surprise, and drama of the moment. They faced the same uncertainty, worry, distraction, and wonder that we face in light of life events that leave us breathless for hope and help. We often fail to grasp how divine participation in the human story is actually what God&#39;s story is all about. Our stories are God&#39;s story. Personal narratives, then and now, seem to be the ways in which God works best as Scripture is transformed from static story to a conversation that informs our own modern dilemmas and uncertainties. Today&#39;s reader can engage with ancient and familiar tales through the lens of pondering where God might be at work in our own lives as well.
As today’s Church is in an unsettling transition, today’s spiritual seekers and those who have grown disenfranchised from or disillusioned with traditional spiritual approaches will find a fresh perspective that opens their own story to the overwhelming constancy of God&#39;s grace and love." />
