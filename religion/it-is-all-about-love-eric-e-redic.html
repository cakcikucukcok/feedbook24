  <title>It Is All About Love - Eric E. Redic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It Is All About Love, is the result of years of study, much prayer, and research into God and His word. Many differing opinions exist concerning who God is, as well as the significance of His covenant. The purpose of this book is to provide clear evidence from scripture that the entire covenant, from its earliest expressions, to its final fulfillment, is nothing less than Gods effort to restore and protect His creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in Genesis, the covenant is examined to reveal its true purpose as well as humanities relationship to it. Aspects of the covenant that have been misunderstood by some, will become clear, as by the light of Gods word, they reveal the Promised Seed, prophesied from the beginning to crush the serpents head and ultimately restore us back to the image of God, and Earth back to the garden God created it to be. The covenant reveals God as He is; the fullness of true love. The covenant unmasked in the light of Gods word, reveals Jesus as the fullness of the covenant. From that tree in the midst of that first garden, to the covenants festivals, feasts, sacrifices, and even the tabernacle erected in the wilderness, a clear picture develops of Gods love and desire to save and restore us to Himself. Every portion of the covenant is a revelation of Jesus Christ and His love. It Is All About love!&lt;/p&gt;" />
