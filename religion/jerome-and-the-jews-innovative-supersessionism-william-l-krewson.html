  <title>Jerome and the Jews: Innovative Supersessionism - William L. Krewson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jerome rocked the boat in which the early church had been comfortably settled for two hundred years. He upset Christian tradition by arguing for the priority of the Hebrew Old Testament over the supposedly inspired Greek Septuagint. He learned Hebrew from a Jewish teacher and translated the Old Testament directly from Hebrew into Latin. Not only did his new Latin translation create turmoil, but the inclusion of Jewish interpretations in his commentaries furthered the controversy. Unlike his contemporaries, Jerome viewed the Jews and their homeland as a source of information and inspiration.  However, at the same time, Jerome freely admitted his hatred of the Jews and their religion. His caustic rhetoric reinforced the Christian church&#39;s displacement of the Jews, but it seems to oppose his move toward appreciating Jewish resources. This book illuminates Jerome&#39;s contradictory personality, proposes a solution, and explores avenues for current Christian and Jewish relations in light of Jerome&#39;s model." />
