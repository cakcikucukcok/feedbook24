  <title>I Prophesy - Tracy Quintana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Prophesy: Breakthrough
(Prophesy means to bubble up; to pour forth words abundantly; to speak by divine inspiration.)
The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was fully of bones, and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very man in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest. Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones (Ezek 37:14).
God spoke to me at the end of 2010 and said, Tracy, there are some things I desire to release into this generation to cause the atmosphere to change, shift, and be realigned so that I may reflect my heavens upon the earth and reflect my likeness upon my people! Therefore, I have called you in this hour to be my mouthpiece and to prophesy and declare my glory in all the earth!
Then he said to me, Prophesy and dont stop! 
This book is a compilation of prophesies posted on Facebook from that time forward (2010).
I pray that this book opens up your heart and gives you a greater understanding of just how powerful the Word of the Lord is when spoken out of your mouth and believed in your heart. It has the ability to move a mountain, calm any storm, and change any situation." />
