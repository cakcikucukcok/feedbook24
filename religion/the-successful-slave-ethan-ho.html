  <title>The Successful Slave - Ethan Ho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What was the most stinging moment that you have experienced, one that might have hurt you deeply and caused you to be angry, bitter, or even hopeless? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of mine was when I received my performance review after clocking an average sixty-hour work week for eight months in a new position. I devoted myself to overcoming the challenges and excelling in my job. I stayed in faith and trusted in God for a breakthrough. It ended with my supervisor telling me, You know what? I think I made a mistake in employing you. Ironically, through the passage of time, God turned the same situation bottom up while transforming me inside out. I later conceded that my supervisor was right.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Joseph fell from being a highly favored son to being a lowly servant before he ascended supernaturally to become the second most powerful man in Egypt. Yet Joseph still faced challenges after his promotion.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Written by a nonministerial Christian, The Successful Slave speaks of a journey of spiritual and emotional growth. It explores the meaning of success when God called Joseph successful at one of the lowest points of his life. It brings hope to its readers through personal testimonies that resonate with the challenges that everyone faces in their everyday lives. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the backdrop of Josephs story, the faithfulness of God is seen manifesting in my life as a full-time working adult. Every chapter not only speaks of Gods goodness toward me but also ends with an encounter in which I share Gods goodness with people around me. Be encouraged. &lt;/p&gt;" />
