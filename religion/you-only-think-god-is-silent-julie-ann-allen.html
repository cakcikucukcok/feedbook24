  <title>You Only Think God Is Silent - Julie Ann Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have those moments where we encounter pain, grief, and struggles and wonder why God would allow this. We have heard those semitheological platitudes about our struggles and questions. Author Julie Ann Allen experienced those when her husband of fourteen years was buried alive on a work site. Julie Ann learned what it was to stand at a crossroad generated by tragedy and make a choice. That moment was a defining moment in her life. She could either ignore God and blame him for the tragedy or rely on God to sustain her, transform her, and reconstruct her life as she passed through this profound tragedy. Julie Ann writes about Gods voice, provisions, and how she eventually chose divine happiness by the hand of God. If you have ever asked any of these questions, Where was God? Why did God allow this? Why cant I hear God? then reading You Only Think God Is Silent is a wonderful place to discover ways you can turn to God and hear the answers to those questions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
