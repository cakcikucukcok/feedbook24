  <title>Earth Angel - Karen J. Vivenzio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Humans have been intrigued by the presence of angels since the beginning of time. Angels are present in every major religion and in almost every culture known to mankind. Have you ever wondered why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journey with Karen J. Vivenzio as she sheds new light on our sacred relationship with the angelic kingdom, the reason for the recent re-emergence of angels in our hearts and minds, and the clues to our own divinity hidden in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by divinely guided messages received from the angelic realm and offering new answers to the age old questions of who we are and why we are here, Earth Angel: Find Your Power, Shine Your Light is a guide to awaken your inner wisdom and empower the light that shines within. Insightful research, positive visualizations, and practical exercises help you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Uncover the divine origins of humankind and the keys to a brighter life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Discover your spiritual gifts and ignite your divine purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Heal fear and self-doubt to claim a life of grace, compassion, and self-acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YOU are an EARTH ANGEL, a DIVINE BEING. It is time to FIND YOUR POWER and SHINE YOUR LIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Earth Angel: Find Your Power, Shine Your Light by Karen J. Vivenzio, is truly a work of love and divine inspiration. This book is full of guidelines, tools, and higher truth to help us move with ease and grace through these dramatically changing times and the exciting journey of ascension. Reading Earth Angel gave me the same all-encompassing feelings of love, compassion, and peace as when Archangel Michael OverLights me and radiates his messages through me. You will want to add this wonderful book to your spiritual library. You will be glad you did.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; RONNA HERMAN VEZANE, international author of thirteen books of Wisdom Teachings from Archangel Michael, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starquestmastery.com&quot;&gt;www.starquestmastery.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
