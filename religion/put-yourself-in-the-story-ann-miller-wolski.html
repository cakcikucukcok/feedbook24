      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God can provide us with everything we need. If we are discouraged, God can give us motivation; when we are hurting, suffering, or lost, he can offer us comfort, healing, and guidance. But God does not always work the way we think he should, and sometimes he reveals his plans in the most unusual ways. If we are not careful, we will miss a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Put Yourself in the Story, author Ann Miller Wolski uses scripture, personal experiences, and faith-based solutions to provide practical applications of Gods Word to everyday life. Whether you need simple daily encouragement or a big hand from God to face lifes most serious heartaches, frustrations, and trials, Put Yourself in the Story shows you how to see yourself living out the stories of the faithful and feel the truth of the scriptures as if you were there too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting yourself in the story of Gods Word, you will not only find personal inspiration, daily encouragement, and a new perspectiveyou will find God as well. Just as God chose to love us, we too must make the choice to love him, discovering in his eternal love the awesome plans he has for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
