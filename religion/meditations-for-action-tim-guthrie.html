  <title>Meditations for Action - Tim Guthrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Much of our suffering  today is because we have lost touch with the human experience, and we are disconnected and in grave danger of crossing the point of no return. So we have a choice: to reconnect with love, faith, and the beauty of the word, or to remain disconnected and only interested in our own material overindulgences. 
In Meditations for ActionYour Full Expression with Love, author Tim Guthrie offers us a way to choose love through a collection of teachings drawn from his own wisdom and from what he could only describe as his frequent and spontaneous discussions with God. Regardless of what form the source of these messages may takeGod, or something else entirely for youthe message is abundantly clear: we have allowed the human experience to run out of control, and we are suffering for itas is the planet. Many of the teachings may seem harsh and demanding, but they ultimately shine a light on the types of lives we should be leading.
We find ourselves in a position of suffering because our love of the truth is coming in a distant second place to our love for ourselves. But if we stand up for what is right with a fire that burns in our bellies, then we can discover the peace and serenity of love and freedom that will flood our hearts." />
