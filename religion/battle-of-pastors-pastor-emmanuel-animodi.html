  <title>Battle of Pastors - Pastor Emmanuel Animodi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There must be changes in the Christiandom, false allegation wrapped up against pastors of churches because of the nature of their job. Religious parasite penetrated into church in disguise as a light. The churches should come together as one body to fight war against the stronghold of the church and NOT to destroy pastors 
(1 Corinthian 3:17) Remember God says if anyone destroys Gods temple God will destroy that person for Gods temple is holy and you together are that temple. It is the LAW of God that the pastors should LOVE their sheep and the sheep should be obedient to the pastors. 
Bible says woe to those who call evil good and good evil who put darkness for light and light for darkness who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter - Isaiah 5:20 
It is time that pastors should stand upon the solid rock and preach the TRUTH according to the words of God. 
Bible say clearly that Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!!! Says the Lord. The Bible says LOVE covered multitudes of sins, let us come together to lift up the hands of our pastor NOT to persecute him with evil words of our mouth. The eye of God watches over you. God bless YOU ALL." />
