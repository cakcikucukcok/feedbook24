  <title>The Empty Front Porch - Cynthia Spraker Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TO:	You&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;SUBJECT:	A porch to Porch Invitation&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;DATE: Now&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Join me on the porch for some Soul Sittin to spark your renewal. Come to the mountain in the storm, travel the back roads to the farm, and share the wanderings that shaped a journey. As we roam, remember, and retrace the steps of your story. Connect porch to Porch, and co-design your life over and over anew, with the Source as your touchstone.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do the work, and youll have a plan that will provide you more hope, security, and fulfillment than you have ever dreamed. This is your time to fill up your empty front porch and create a deeper, more compelling life than you can author on your own. If it scares you, remember that there is no safer place than being with our greatest Fan. Lets do some Soul Sittin and create your porch to Porch plan. Weve saved you a seat.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Empty Front Porch is a wonderful book. With insouciance, humor, and first-rate story telling, Cynthia Mills provides a clarion call for a life that is truly worth living. While that would be more than enough, her book also provides a compelling workbook full of the experiential exercises that will turn your vocation into a way of life. If you are seeking a more meaningful life then read this book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are uncertain about your faith or well along in your journey, the insights Cynthia shares will cause you to pause, sit a while, and stop the swirl of the world around you. Learn how silence can speak boldly and refresh your soul. Choose to walk up the porch steps, take your seat, and accept a hand to co-create the life you are truly meant to live!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an eye-opening resource for Christians to evaluate their porch. In todays busy world, it is easy to lose focus of what is truly important. Take the time to sit with your soul, and design your porch to Porch plan. Cynthia is a shining light for the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
