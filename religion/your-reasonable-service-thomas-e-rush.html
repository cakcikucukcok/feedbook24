  <title>Your Reasonable Service - Thomas E. Rush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Your Reasonable Service is to bring clarification to the issue of spiritual gifts. A number of important questions about the subject are answered, founded in an honest attempt to discover what the Bible says about the gifts. How many spiritual gifts are there? How do I discover my gift? Can I have more than one gift? Should I have all the gifts? Can I have all the gifts? How can I most effectively use my gifts? Do my personality traits or natural human abilities have any bearing on my giftedness? What is the purpose of spiritual gifts? How can I know how other Christians are gifted, and what does that mean for me? What impact does a proper biblical understanding of the gifts have on the local church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the purpose is to bring clarification, the goal is to provide a tool that pastors, churches, and laypersons can use to determine Gods design for their service to the Lord. One area of the Holy Spirits work that surely needs emphasis in the church today is the work that God desires to do through His church by the exercise of the spiritual gifts given to each and every saint. The bottom-line objective is to help each believer, each church member, discover their Holy Spirit-given motivation for ministry. That motivation is your spiritual gift.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A great motto for a church would be, Every member a minister. Of course, for that to happen, the pastor and membership would need to get serious about understanding and discovering the spiritual gifts of each member. I believe that any Bible-believing church would find the results of such an effort to be a tremendous blessing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
