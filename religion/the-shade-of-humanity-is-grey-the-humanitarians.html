Humanity is enthralling when you see various nuances of it. Human experiences are didactic, teach us lessons of life, change our perceptions and leave us wise. An act of kindness makes one attain spirituality and brings one nearer to god. Humanity in its various shades presents itself before us in these stories. The poems spell out a model code of conduct for one and redefines religion for us." />
