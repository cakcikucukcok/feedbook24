  <title>America! What Happened to “In God We Trust”? - Jason Falls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you tired of the godless way this country is living and how godless leaders are running our country into the ground? Are you tired of our leaders apologizing to the rest of the world for America being a Christian nation? If you answered yes, then author Jason Falls encourages you to read this book, study Gods word, pass it on to someone else, and do something about it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is a wake up call from God meant to light a fire in our very souls to get back to the basic trust in God upon which this country was founded. Like so many of us, Jason Falls was taught in elementary school that the Pilgrims came over from England in search of religious freedom to worship the one true God the way He requires us to do. Jason Falls does not believe this is being taught today, so this book can be a short history lesson for some about the founding of our great nation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What we need today is less government, more God, and more God in the government. This is the way our Christian forefathers intended it to be. So Jason Falls urges you to become closer to God and pray for His guidance in making choices that will affect our country, and spread the message that says, Yes, we can be a Christian nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
