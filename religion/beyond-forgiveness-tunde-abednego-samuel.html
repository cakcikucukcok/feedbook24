  <title>Beyond Forgiveness - Tunde Abednego Samuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pastor A. T. Samuel, in this book, captured very well one of the major problems ravaging Christian homes, societies, and churches throughout the world today. Those problems are related to the lack of the spirit of forgiveness in the daily interaction among people.
It was Alexander Pope, an English poet in the eighteenth century, who said that to err is human and to forgive is divine. This book shows clearly, with numerous references to biblical passages, that the wounds caused by lack of forgiveness can be healed only through the intervention of the Holy Spirit.
Christian brothers and sisters together with others in our societies who are burdened with unforgiveness will gain tremendously by reading this book, which is written in simple English and reinforced with many relevant and valuable biblical quotations." />
